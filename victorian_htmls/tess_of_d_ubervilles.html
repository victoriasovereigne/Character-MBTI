<p/>Phase the First: The Maiden


<p/>I


<p/>On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking
homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining
Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor. The pair of legs that carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>)
were rickety, and there was a bias in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>) gait which inclined him (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>)
somewhat to the left of a straight line. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>) occasionally gave a
smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>) was not
thinking of anything in particular. An empty egg-basket was slung
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>) arm, the nap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>) hat was ruffled, a patch being quite
worn away at its brim where his (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>) thumb came in taking it off.
Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>) was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare,
who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blakemore</b></font>) rode, hummed a wandering tune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night t`ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man with the basket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, Sir John,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/>The pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted, and turned round.

<p/>``Now, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market-day on this road
about this time, and I said ``Good night,<div class="bookquote">'' and you made reply '_Good
night, Sir John_,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as now.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And once before that--near a month ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then what might your meaning be in calling me <div class="bookquote">``Sir John' these
different times, when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The parson</b></font>)</div><p/>The parson rode a step or two nearer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only my whim,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) said; and, after a moment's hesitation: ``It
was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago, whilst I
was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history. I am Parson
Tringham, the antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane. Don't you really know,
Durbeyfield, that you are the lineal representative of the ancient
and knightly family of the d``Urbervilles, who derive their descent
from Sir Pagan d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville, that renowned knight who came from
Normandy with William the Conqueror, as appears by Battle Abbey
Roll?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pagan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never heard it before, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well it's true. Throw up your chin a moment, so that I may catch
the profile of your face better. Yes, that's the d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville nose
and chin--a little debased. Your ancestor was one of the twelve
knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
conquest of Glamorganshire. Branches of your family held manors over
all this part of England; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the
time of King Stephen. In the reign of King John one of them was rich
enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and in Edward the
Second's time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to
attend the great Council there. You declined a little in Oliver
Cromwell's time, but to no serious extent, and in Charles the
Second's reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your
loyalty. Aye, there have been generations of Sir Johns among
you, and if knighthood were hereditary, like a baronetcy, as it
practically was in old times, when men were knighted from father
to son, you would be Sir John now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye don't say so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In short,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>concluded the parson, decisively smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) leg with
his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) switch, <div class="bookquote">``there's hardly such another family in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Daze my eyes, and isn't there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Durbeyfield. <div class="bookquote">``And here have I
been knocking about, year after year, from pillar to post, as if I
was no more than the commonest feller in the parish... And how long
hev this news about me been knowed, Pa`son Tringham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The clergyman</b></font>)</div><p/>The clergyman explained that, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was aware, it had quite
died out of knowledge, and could hardly be said to be known at all.
His (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring
when, having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the
d``Urberville family, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had observed Durbeyfield's name on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
waggon, and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
father and grandfather till he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had no doubt on the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of
information,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``However, our impulses are too strong for our
judgement sometimes. I thought you might perhaps know something of
it all the while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, I have heard once or twice, `tis true, that my family had seen
better days afore they came to Blackmoor. But I took no notice o`t,
thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now
keep only one. I've got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal
at home, too; but, Lord, what's a spoon and seal? ... And to think
that I and these noble d``Urbervilles were one flesh all the time.
``Twas said that my gr`t-granfer had secrets, and didn't care to talk
of where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) came from... And where do we raise our smoke, now,
parson, if I may make so bold; I mean, where do we d<div class="bookquote">``Urbervilles
live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't live anywhere. You are extinct--as a county family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male
line--that is, gone down--gone under.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then where do we lie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill: rows and rows of you in your vaults,
with your effigies under Purbeck-marble canopies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where be our family mansions and estates?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh? No lands neither?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None; though you once had 'em in abundance, as I said, for you
family consisted of numerous branches. In this county there was a
seat of yours at Kingsbere, and another at Sherton, and another in
Millpond, and another at Lullstead, and another at Wellbridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall we ever come into our own again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--that I can't tell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what had I better do about it, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>asked Durbeyfield, after a
pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--nothing, nothing; except chasten yourself with the thought of
`how are the mighty fallen.''  (<font color='red'><b>the historian genealogist</b></font>)</div>It is a fact of some interest to the
local historian and genealogist, nothing more. There are several
families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre.
Good night.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll turn back and have a quart of beer wi' me on the strength
o`t, Pa`son Tringham? There's a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure
Drop--though, to be sure, not so good as at Rolliver's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you--not this evening, Durbeyfield. You've had enough
already.''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>Concluding thus, the parson rode on his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) way, with doubts
as to his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was gone, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound
reverie, and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside,
depositing his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) basket before him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>). In a few minutes a youth appeared
in the distance, walking in the same direction as that which had been
pursued by Durbeyfield. The latter, on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), held up his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) hand,
and the lad quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) pace and came near.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Boy, take up that basket! I want `ee to go on an errand for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The lath-like stripling frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Who be you, then, John
Durbeyfield, to order me about and call me `boy'? You know my
name as well as I know yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you, do you? That's the secret--that's the secret! Now obey my
orders, and take the message I'm going to charge `ee wi'... Well,
Fred, I don't mind telling you that the secret is that I'm one of a
noble race--it has been just found out by me this present afternoon,
P.M.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from
his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) sitting position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank
among the daisies.

<p/>The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) length from
crown to toe.

<p/>``Sir John d``Urberville--that's who I am,'' continued the prostrate
man. ``That is if knights were baronets--which they be. <div class="bookquote">``Tis
recorded in history all about me. Dost know of such a place, lad,
as Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ees. I've been there to Greenhill Fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, under the church of that city there lie--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tisn't a city, the place I mean; leastwise `twaddn' when I was
there--'twas a little one-eyed, blinking sort o' place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind the place, boy, that's not the question before us.
Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors--hundreds of
'em--in coats of mail and jewels, in gr't lead coffins weighing tons
and tons. There's not a man in the county o' South-Wessex that's
got grander and nobler skillentons in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when you've come
to The Pure Drop Inn, tell 'em to send a horse and carriage to me
immed`ately, to carry me hwome. And in the bottom o' the carriage
they be to put a noggin o' rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up
to my account. And when you've done that goo on to my house with
the basket, and tell my wife to put away that washing, because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
needn't finish it, and wait till I come hwome, as I've news to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/>As the lad stood in a dubious attitude, Durbeyfield put his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hand in
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) pocket, and produced a shilling, one of the chronically few that
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) possessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's for your labour, lad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>This made a difference in the young man's estimate of the position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir John. Thank `ee. Anything else I can do for `ee, Sir
John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell 'em at hwome that I should like for supper,--well, lamb's fry
if they can get it; and if they can't, black-pot; and if they can't
get that, well chitterlings will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy took up the basket, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) set out the notes of a brass
band were heard from the direction of the village.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Durbeyfield. <div class="bookquote">``Not on account o' I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis the women's club-walking, Sir John. Why, your da`ter is one o'
the members.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure--I'd quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things!
Well, vamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and
maybe I'll drive round and inspect the club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lad</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and
daisies in the evening sun. Not a soul passed that way for a long
while, and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds
audible within the rim of blue hills.



<p/>II


<p/>The village of Marlott lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the
beautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled
and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or
landscape-painter, though within a four hours' journey from London.

<p/>It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the
summits of the hills that surround it--except perhaps during the
droughts of summer. An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad
weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous,
and miry ways.

<p/>This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are
never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the
bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill,
Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The
traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score
of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches
the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted
to behold, extended like a map beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), a country differing
absolutely from that which he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) has passed through. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) the
hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give
an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the
hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless. Here, in the
valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more
delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from
this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads
overspreading the paler green of the grass. The atmosphere beneath
is languorous, and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the
middle distance partakes also of that hue, while the horizon beyond
is of the deepest ultramarine. Arable lands are few and limited;
with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass
and trees, mantling minor hills and dales within the major. Such is
the Vale of Blackmoor.

<p/>The district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest.
The Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from
a curious legend of King Henry III's reign, in which the killing by
a certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king
had run down and spared, was made the occasion of a heavy fine.
In those days, and till comparatively recent times, the country was
densely wooded. Even now, traces of its earlier condition are to be
found in the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet
survive upon its slopes, and the hollow-trunked trees that shade so
many of its pastures.

<p/>The forests have departed, but some old customs of their shades
remain. Many, however, linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised
form. The May-Day dance, for instance, was to be discerned on
the afternoon under notice, in the guise of the club revel, or
<div class="bookquote">``club-walking,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as it was there called.

<p/>It was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of Marlott,
though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the
ceremony. Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of
walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the
members being solely women. In men's clubs such celebrations were,
though expiring, less uncommon; but either the natural shyness of the
softer sex, or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives,
had denuded such women's clubs as remained -LRB-if any other did-RRB- or this
their glory and consummation. The club of Marlott alone lived to
uphold the local Cerealia. It had walked for hundreds of years, if
not as benefit-club, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and it walked
still.

<p/>The banded ones were all dressed in white gowns--a gay survival from
Old Style days, when cheerfulness and May-time were synonyms--days
before the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a
monotonous average. Their first exhibition of themselves was in a
processional march of two and two round the parish. Ideal and real
clashed slightly as the sun lit up their figures against the green
hedges and creeper-laced house-fronts; for, though the whole troop
wore white garments, no two whites were alike among them. Some
approached pure blanching; some had a bluish pallor; some worn by the
older characters -LRB-which had possibly lain by folded for many a year-RRB-
inclined to a cadaverous tint, and to a Georgian style.

<p/>In addition to the distinction of a white frock, every woman and girl
carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right hand a peeled willow wand, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left a
bunch of white flowers. The peeling of the former, and the selection
of the latter, had been an operation of personal care.

<p/>There were a few middle-aged and even elderly women in the train,
their silver-wiry hair and wrinkled faces, scourged by time and
trouble, having almost a grotesque, certainly a pathetic, appearance
in such a jaunty situation. In a true view, perhaps, there was more
to be gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one, to whom
the years were drawing nigh when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should say, <div class="bookquote">``I have no pleasure
in them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>than of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) juvenile comrades. But let the elder be passed
over here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and
warm.

<p/>The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their
heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold,
and black, and brown. Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful
nose, others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. A
difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public
scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate
self-consciousness from their features, was apparent in them, and
showed that they were genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many
eyes.

<p/>And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each
had a private little sun for her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) soul to bask in; some dream, some
affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which,
though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will.
They were all cheerful, and many of them merry.

<p/>They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the
high road to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of
the women said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Load-a-Lord! Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn't thy father
riding hwome in a carriage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>A young member of the band turned her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) head at the exclamation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was a fine and handsome girl--not handsomer than some others,
possibly--but her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added
eloquence to colour and shape. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wore a red ribbon in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hair,
and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such
a pronounced adornment. As she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) looked round Durbeyfield was seen
moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven
by a frizzle-headed brawny damsel with her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) gown-sleeves rolled above
her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) elbows. This was the cheerful servant of that establishment,
who, in her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) part of factotum, turned groom and ostler at times.
Durbeyfield, leaning back, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>) eyes closed luxuriously, was
waving his (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>) hand above his (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>) head, and singing in a slow recitative--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've-got-a-gr`t-family-vault-at-Kingsbere--and
knighted-forefathers-in-lead-coffins-there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The clubbists tittered, except the girl called Tess--in whom a slow
heat seemed to rise at the sense that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father was making himself
foolish in their eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s tired, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said hastily, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has got a lift
home, because our own horse has to rest to-day.''

market-nitch. Haw-haw!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here; I won't walk another inch with you, if you say any jokes
about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Tess cried, and the colour upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheeks spread over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face and neck. In a moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes grew moist, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) glance
drooped to the ground. Perceiving that they had really pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
they said no more, and order again prevailed. Tess's pride would not
allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head again, to learn what her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's meaning
was, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had any; and thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) moved on with the whole body to the
enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green. By the time
the spot was reached she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) has recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) equanimity, and tapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
neighbour with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wand and talked as usual.

<p/>Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) life was a mere vessel of
emotion untinctured by experience. The dialect was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) tongue
to some extent, despite the village school: the characteristic
intonation of that dialect for this district being the voicing
approximately rendered by the syllable UR, probably as rich an
utterance as any to be found in human speech. The pouted-up deep red
mouth to which this syllable was native had hardly as yet settled
into its definite shape, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) lower lip had a way of thrusting the
middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) top one upward, when they closed together after a word.

<p/>Phases of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) childhood lurked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) aspect still. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) walked
along to-day, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) bouncing handsome womanliness, you could
sometimes see her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) twelfth year in her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) cheeks, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) ninth sparkling
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) eyes; and even her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) fifth would flit over the curves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
mouth now and then.

<p/>Yet few knew, and still fewer considered this. A small minority,
mainly strangers, would look long at her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) in casually passing by, and
grow momentarily fascinated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) freshness, and wonder if they
would ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) again: but to almost everybody she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was a fine and
picturesque country girl, and no more.

<p/>Nothing was seen or heard further of Durbeyfield in his (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) triumphal
chariot under the conduct of the ostleress, and the club having
entered the allotted space, dancing began. As there were no men in
the company, the girls danced at first with each other, but when the
hour for the close of labour drew on, the masculine inhabitants of
the village, together with other idlers and pedestrians, gathered
round the spot, and appeared inclined to negotiate for a partner.

<p/>Among these on-lookers were three young men of a superior class,
carrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders, and stout
sticks in their hands. Their general likeness to each other, and
their consecutive ages, would almost have suggested that they might
be, what in fact they were, brothers. The eldest wore the white tie,
high waistcoat, and thin-brimmed hat of the regulation curate; the
second was the normal undergraduate; the appearance of the third and
youngest would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him (<font color='blue'><b>ages</b></font>); there
was an uncribbed, uncabined aspect in his (<font color='blue'><b>ages</b></font>) eyes and attire, implying
that he (<font color='blue'><b>ages</b></font>) had hardly as yet found the entrance to his (<font color='blue'><b>ages</b></font>) professional
groove. That he (<font color='blue'><b>ages</b></font>) was a desultory tentative student of something and
everything might only have been predicted of him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>).

<p/>These three brethren told casual acquaintance that they were spending
their Whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the Vale of
Blackmoor, their course being south-westerly from the town of Shaston
on the north-east.

<p/>They leant over the gate by the highway, and inquired as to the
meaning of the dance and the white-frocked maids. The two elder of
the brothers were plainly not intending to linger more than a moment,
but the spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners
seemed to amuse the third, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) in no hurry to move on. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>)
unstrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) knapsack, put it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) stick, on the hedge-bank,
and opened the gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do, Angel?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the eldest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am inclined to go and have a fling with them. Why not all of
us--just for a minute or two--it will not detain us long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--no; nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the first. <div class="bookquote">``Dancing in public with a troop
of country hoydens--suppose we should be seen! Come along, or it
will be dark before we get to Stourcastle, and there's no place we
can sleep at nearer than that; besides, we must get through another
chapter of _A Counterblast to Agnosticism_ before we turn in, now I
have taken the trouble to bring the book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right--I'll overtake you and Cuthbert in five minutes; don't
stop; I give my word that I will, Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The two elder reluctantly left him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) and walked on, taking their
brother's knapsack to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in following, and the youngest
entered the field.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a thousand pities,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said gallantly, to two or three of
the girls nearest him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as soon as there was a pause in the dance.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are your partners, my dears?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've not left off work yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered one of the boldest.
<div class="bookquote">``They'll be here by and by. Till then, will you be one, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. But what's one among so many!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Better than none. <div class="bookquote">``Tis melancholy work facing and footing it to one
of your own sort, and no clipsing and colling at all. Now, pick and
choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Ssh--don't be so for`ard!''  (<font color='red'><b>a shyer girl</b></font>)</div>said a shyer girl.

<p/>The young man, thus invited, glanced them over, and attempted some
discrimination; but, as the group were all so new to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
not very well exercise it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took almost the first that came to
hand, which was not the speaker, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had expected; nor did it
happen to be Tess Durbeyfield. Pedigree, ancestral skeletons,
monumental record, the d``Urberville lineaments, did not help Tess in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life's battle as yet, even to the extent of attracting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) a
dancing-partner over the heads of the commonest peasantry. So much
for Norman blood unaided by Victorian lucre.

<p/>The name of the eclipsing girl, whatever it was, has not been handed
down; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury
of a masculine partner that evening. Yet such was the force of
example that the village young men, who had not hastened to enter
the gate while no intruder was in the way, now dropped in quickly,
and soon the couples became leavened with rustic youth to a marked
extent, till at length the plainest woman in the club was no longer
compelled to foot it on the masculine side of the figure.

<p/>The church clock struck, when suddenly the student said that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) must
leave--he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had been forgetting himself--he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had to join his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) companions.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) fell out of the dance his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield,
whose own large orbs wore, to tell the truth, the faintest aspect of
reproach that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had not chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>), too, was sorry then that,
owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) backwardness, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had not observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>); and with that in
his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) left the pasture.

<p/>On account of his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) long delay he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) started in a flying-run down the lane
westward, and had soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise.
He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had not yet overtaken his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) brothers, but he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) paused to get breath,
and looked back. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) could see the white figures of the girls in the
green enclosure whirling about as they had whirled when he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was among
them. They seemed to have quite forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) already.

<p/>All of them, except, perhaps, one. This white shape stood apart
by the hedge alone. From her (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) position he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) knew it to be the pretty
maiden with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had not danced. Trifling as the matter was, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>)
yet instinctively felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was hurt by his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) oversight. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) wished
that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had inquired her (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) name. She (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>)
was so modest, so expressive, she (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had looked so soft in her (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) thin
white gown that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had acted stupidly.

<p/>However, it could not be helped, and turning, and bending himself to
a rapid walk, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) dismissed the subject from his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) mind.



<p/>III


<p/>As for Tess Durbeyfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) did not so easily dislodge the incident
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) consideration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had no spirit to dance again for a long
time, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) might have had plenty of partners; but ah! they did
not speak so nicely as the strange young man had done. It was not
till the rays of the sun had absorbed the young stranger's retreating
figure on the hill that she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) shook off her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) temporary sadness and
answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) would-be partner in the affirmative.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) comrades till dusk, and participated with a
certain zest in the dancing; though, being heart-whole as yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
enjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake; little divining
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) saw <div class="bookquote">``the soft torments, the bitter sweets, the pleasing
pains, and the agreeable distresses''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>of those girls who had been
wooed and won, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) herself was capable of in that kind. The
struggles and wrangles of the lads for her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) hand in a jig were an
amusement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)--no more; and when they became fierce she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) rebuked
them.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) might have stayed even later, but the incident of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) father's
odd appearance and manner returned upon the girl's mind to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
anxious, and wondering what had become of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) dropped away from
the dancers and bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) steps towards the end of the village at
which the parental cottage lay.

<p/>While yet many score yards off, other rhythmic sounds than those she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
had quitted became audible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>); sounds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) knew well--so
well. They were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of
the house, occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone
floor, to which movement a feminine voice kept time by singing, in a
vigorous gallopade, the favourite ditty of <div class="bookquote">``The Spotted Cow'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--


<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) lie do'-own in yon'-der green gro'-ove;
Come, love!<div class="bookquote">'' and I'll tell' you where!''


 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The cradle-rocking and the song would cease simultaneously for a
moment, and an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the
place of the melody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless thy diment eyes! And thy waxen cheeks! And thy cherry
mouth! And thy Cubit's thighs! And every bit o' thy blessed body!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence,
and the <div class="bookquote">``Spotted Cow''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>proceed as before. So matters stood when Tess
opened the door and paused upon the mat within it, surveying the
scene.

<p/>The interior, in spite of the melody, struck upon the girl's senses
with an unspeakable dreariness. From the holiday gaieties of the
field--the white gowns, the nosegays, the willow-wands, the whirling
movements on the green, the flash of gentle sentiment towards the
stranger--to the yellow melancholy of this one-candled spectacle,
what a step! Besides the jar of contrast there came to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a chill
self-reproach that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not returned sooner, to help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother
in these domesticities, instead of indulging herself out-of-doors.

<p/>There stood her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother amid the group of children, as Tess had left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), hanging over the Monday washing-tub, which had now, as always,
lingered on to the end of the week. Out of that tub had come the day
before--Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse--the very white
frock upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) back which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had so carelessly greened about the
skirt on the damping grass--which had been wrung up and ironed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
mother's own hands.

<p/>As usual, Mrs Durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub,
the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
youngest child. The cradle-rockers had done hard duty for so many
years, under the weight of so many children, on that flagstone floor,
that they were worn nearly flat, in consequence of which a huge jerk
accompanied each swing of the cot, flinging the baby from side to
side like a weaver's shuttle, as Mrs Durbeyfield, excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
song, trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) after
a long day's seething in the suds.

<p/>Nick-knock, nick-knock, went the cradle; the candle-flame stretched
itself tall, and began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from
the matron's elbows, and the song galloped on to the end of the
verse, Mrs Durbeyfield regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) daughter the while. Even now,
when burdened with a young family, Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate
lover of tune. No ditty floated into Blackmoor Vale from the outer
world but Tess's mother caught up its notation in a week.

<p/>There still faintly beamed from the woman's features something of
the freshness, and even the prettiness, of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) youth; rendering it
probable that the personal charms which Tess could boast of were in
main part her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's gift, and therefore unknightly, unhistorical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll rock the cradle for `ee, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div>said the daughter gently.
<div class="bookquote">``Or I'll take off my best frock and help you wring up? I thought you
had finished long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother bore Tess no ill-will for leaving the housework to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
single-handed efforts for so long; indeed, Joan seldom upbraided
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) thereon at any time, feeling but slightly the lack of Tess's
assistance whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) instinctive plan for relieving herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
labours lay in postponing them. To-night, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was even in a
blither mood than usual. There was a dreaminess, a pre-occupation,
an exaltation, in the maternal look which the girl could not
understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm glad you've come,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother said, as soon as the last
note had passed out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I want to go and fetch your father;
but what's more'n that, I want to tell `ee what have happened. Y'll
be fess enough, my poppet, when th`st know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mrs Durbeyfield
habitually spoke the dialect; her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) daughter, who had passed the Sixth
Standard in the National School under a London-trained mistress,
spoke two languages: the dialect at home, more or less; ordinary
English abroad and to persons of quality.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since I've been away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Tess asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had it anything to do with father's making such a mommet of himself

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is father now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>asked Tess suddenly.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) called
to see the doctor to-day in Shaston. It is not consumption at all,
it seems. It is fat round his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart, 'a says. There, it is like
this.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Joan Durbeyfield, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) spoke, curved a sodden thumb
and forefinger to the shape of the letter C, and used the other
forefinger as a pointer. <div class="bookquote">''`At the present moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) says to your

complete--'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr</b></font>)</div>`off you will go like a shadder, Mr Durbeyfield,'' 'a says.
<div class="bookquote">``You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess looked alarmed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father possibly to go behind the eternal
cloud so soon, notwithstanding this sudden greatness!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where IS father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked again.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother put on a deprecating look. <div class="bookquote">``Now don't you be bursting out
angry! The poor man--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt so rafted after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uplifting by the

of beehives, which must be delivered, family or no. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll have to
start shortly after twelve to-night, as the distance is so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess impetuously, the tears welling to

And you as well agreed as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rebuke and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mood seemed to fill the whole room, and to impart
a cowed look to the furniture, and candle, and children playing
about, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the latter touchily, <div class="bookquote">``I be not agreed. I have been
waiting for `ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, Tess. You see, it would be no use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess did not expostulate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew what her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's objection
meant. Mrs Durbeyfield's jacket and bonnet were already hanging
slily upon a chair by her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) side, in readiness for this contemplated
jaunt, the reason for which the matron deplored more than its
necessity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And take the _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ to the outhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Joan
continued, rapidly wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) hands, and donning the garments.

<p/>The _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ was an old thick volume, which lay on a
table at her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) elbow, so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached
the edge of the type. Tess took it up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother started.

<p/>This going to hunt up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shiftless husband at the inn was one of
Mrs Durbeyfield's still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of
rearing children. To discover him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at Rolliver's, to sit there for
an hour or two by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) side and dismiss all thought and care of the
children during the interval, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rolliver</b></font>) happy. A sort of halo, an
occidental glow, came over life then. Troubles and other realities
took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability, sinking to mere
mental phenomena for serene contemplation, and no longer stood as
pressing concretions which chafed body and soul. The youngsters,
not immediately within sight, seemed rather bright and desirable
appurtenances than otherwise; the incidents of daily life were not
without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rolliver</b></font>) felt a
little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rolliver</b></font>) had used to feel when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rolliver</b></font>) sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rolliver</b></font>) now wedded husband
in the same spot during his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wooing, shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rolliver</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) defects
of character, and regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ideal presentation as
lover.

<p/>Tess, being left alone with the younger children, went first to the
outhouse with the fortune-telling book, and stuffed it into the
thatch. A curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ever allowing it to stay in the house all
night, and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted.
Between the mother, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fast-perishing lumber of superstitions,
folk-lore, dialect, and orally transmitted ballads, and the daughter,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) trained National teachings and Standard knowledge under an
infinitely Revised Code, there was a gap of two hundred years as
ordinarily understood. When they were together the Jacobean and the
Victorian ages were juxtaposed.

<p/>Returning along the garden path Tess mused on what the mother could
have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it, but did not
divine that it solely concerned herself. Dismissing this, however,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the
day-time, in company with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nine-year-old brother Abraham, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
sister Eliza-Louisa of twelve and a half, called <div class="bookquote">''`Liza-Lu,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>the
youngest ones being put to bed. There was an interval of four years
and more between Tess and the next of the family, the two who had
filled the gap having died in their infancy, and this lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) a
deputy-maternal attitude when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) juniors. Next
in juvenility to Abraham came two more girls, Hope and Modesty; then
a boy of three, and then the baby, who had just completed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) first
year.

<p/>All these young souls were passengers in the Durbeyfield
ship--entirely dependent on the judgement of the two Durbeyfield
adults for their pleasures, their necessities, their health, even
their existence. If the heads of the Durbeyfield household chose
to sail into difficulty, disaster, starvation, disease, degradation,
death, thither were these half-dozen little captives under hatches
compelled to sail with them--six helpless creatures, who had never
been asked if they wished for life on any terms, much less if they
wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of
the shiftless house of Durbeyfield. Some people would like to know
whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound
and trustworthy as his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) song is breezy and pure, gets his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) authority
for speaking of <div class="bookquote">``Nature's holy plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the poet</b></font>)</div><p/>It grew later, and neither father nor mother reappeared. Tess looked
out of the door, and took a mental journey through Marlott. The
village was shutting its eyes. Candles and lamps were being put
out everywhere: she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the
extended hand.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's fetching simply meant one more to fetch. Tess began to
perceive that a man in indifferent health, who proposed to start on a
journey before one in the morning, ought not to be at an inn at this
late hour celebrating his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ancient blood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Abraham,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) little brother, <div class="bookquote">``do you put on your
hat--you bain't afraid?--and go up to Rolliver's, and see what has
gone wi' father and mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy jumped promptly from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seat, and opened the door, and the
night swallowed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up. Half an hour passed yet again; neither man,
woman, nor child returned. Abraham, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) parents, seemed to have
been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/>``Liza-Lu then went to bed, and Tess, locking them all in, started on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty
progress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and when
one-handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day.



<p/>IV


<p/>Rolliver's inn, the single alehouse at this end of the long and
broken village, could only boast of an off-licence; hence, as
nobody could legally drink on the premises, the amount of overt
accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board
about six inches wide and two yards long, fixed to the garden palings
by pieces of wire, so as to form a ledge. On this board thirsty
strangers deposited their cups as they stood in the road and drank,
and threw the dregs on the dusty ground to the pattern of Polynesia,
and wished they could have a restful seat inside.

<p/>Thus the strangers. But there were also local customers who felt the
same wish; and where there's a will there's a way.

<p/>In a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which was thickly
curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the
landlady, Mrs Rolliver, were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen
persons, all seeking beatitude; all old inhabitants of the nearer
end of Marlott, and frequenters of this retreat. Not only did the
distance to the The Pure Drop, the fully-licensed tavern at the
further part of the dispersed village, render its accommodation
practically unavailable for dwellers at this end; but the far more
serious question, the quality of the liquor, confirmed the prevalent
opinion that it was better to drink with Rolliver in a corner of the
housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house.

<p/>A gaunt four-post bedstead which stood in the room afforded
sitting-space for several persons gathered round three of its sides;
a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers;
another rested on the oak-carved <div class="bookquote">``cwoffer'' (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>; two on the wash-stand;
another on the stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at their
ease. The stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at this
hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins, and
spread their personalities warmly through the room. In this process
the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and
luxurious; the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the
richness of tapestry; the brass handles of the chest of drawers were
as golden knockers; and the carved bedposts seemed to have some
kinship with the magnificent pillars of Solomon's temple.

<p/>Mrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from
Tess, opened the front door, crossed the downstairs room, which was
in deep gloom, and then unfastened the stair-door like one whose
fingers knew the tricks of the latches well. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ascent of the
crooked staircase was a slower process, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face, as it rose into
the light above the last stair, encountered the gaze of all the party
assembled in the bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--Being a few private friends I've asked in to keep up club-walking
at my own expense,''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps,
as glibly as a child repeating the Catechism, while she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) peered over
the stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, `tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield--Lard--how you frightened
me!--I thought it might be some gaffer sent by Gover`ment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder
of the conclave, and turned to where her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) husband sat. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was humming
absently to himself, in a low tone: <div class="bookquote">``I be as good as some folks here
and there! I've got a great family vault at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill,
and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've something to tell `ee that's come into my head about that--a
grand projick!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>whispered his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cheerful wife. <div class="bookquote">``Here, John, don't `ee
see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nudged him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), looking through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as through a
window-pane, went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) recitative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Don't `ee sing so loud, my good man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady; <div class="bookquote">``in
case any member of the Gover`ment should be passing, and take away my
licends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)'s told `ee what's happened to us, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs
Durbeyfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--in a way. D'ye think there's any money hanging by it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's the secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Joan Durbeyfield sagely. <div class="bookquote">``However,
`tis well to be kin to a coach, even if you don't ride in `en.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) public voice, and continued in a low tone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) husband:
<div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking since you brought the news that there's a great
rich lady out by Trantridge, on the edge o' The Chase, of the name of
d'Urberville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey--what's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/St John</b></font>)</div>said Sir John.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) repeated the information. <div class="bookquote">``That lady must be our relation,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``And my projick is to send Tess to claim kin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There IS a lady of the name, now you mention it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Durbeyfield.
<div class="bookquote">``Pa`son Tringham didn't think of that. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s nothing beside
we--a junior branch of us, no doubt, hailing long since King Norman's
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div><p/>While this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed,
in their preoccupation, that little Abraham had crept into the room,
and was awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is rich, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d be sure to take notice o' the maid,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Durbeyfield; <div class="bookquote">``and `twill be a very good thing. I don't
see why two branches o' one family should not be on visiting terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and we'll all claim kin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div>said Abraham brightly from under the
bedstead. <div class="bookquote">``And we'll all go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) when Tess has gone to live
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); and we'll ride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) coach and wear black clothes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you come here, child? What nonsense be ye talking! Go away,
and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready! ... Well,
Tess ought to go to this other member of our family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)'d be sure
to win the lady--Tess would; and likely enough `twould lead to some
noble gentleman marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). In short, I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fate in the _Fortune-Teller_, and it brought out that
very thing! ... You should ha' seen how pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked to-day;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) skin is as sumple as a duchess'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What says the maid herself to going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not asked her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) don't know there is any such lady-relation
yet. But it would certainly put her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) in the way of a grand marriage,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) won't say nay to going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess is queer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)'s tractable at bottom. Leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>folks</b></font>)</div><p/>Though this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import
reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that
the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common
folks had, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine
prospects in store.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess is a fine figure o' fun, as I said to myself to-day when I zeed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) vamping round parish with the rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boozers</b></font>)</div>observed one of the elderly
boozers in an undertone. <div class="bookquote">``But Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
don't get green malt in floor.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a local phrase which had a
peculiar meaning, and there was no reply.

<p/>The conversation became inclusive, and presently other footsteps were
heard crossing the room below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--Being a few private friends asked in to-night to keep up
club-walking at my own expense.''  (<font color='red'><b>The landlady</b></font>)</div>The landlady had rapidly re-used
the formula she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) kept on hand for intruders before she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) recognized that
the newcomer was Tess.

<p/>Even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's gaze the girl's young features looked sadly
out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as
no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middle-age; and hardly was a
reproachful flash from Tess's dark eyes needed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father
and mother rise from their seats, hastily finish their ale, and
descend the stairs behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), Mrs Rolliver's caution following
their footsteps.

<p/>``No noise, please, if ye'll be so good, my dears; or I mid lose my
licends, and be summons'd, and I don't know what all! <div class="bookquote">``Night t`ye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>They went home together, Tess holding one arm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father, and Mrs
Durbeyfield the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had, in truth, drunk very little--not a
fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to
church on a Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eastings or
genuflections; but the weakness of Sir John's constitution made
mountains of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) petty sins in this kind. On reaching the fresh
air he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one
moment as if they were marching to London, and at another as if they
were marching to Bath--which produced a comical effect, frequent
enough in families on nocturnal homegoings; and, like most comical
effects, not quite so comic after all. The two women valiantly
disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they
could from Durbeyfield, their cause, and from Abraham, and from
themselves; and so they approached by degrees their own door, the
head of the family bursting suddenly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) former refrain as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>)
drew near, as if to fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) soul at sight of the smallness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) present residence--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a fam--ily vault at Kingsbere!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush--don't be so silly, Jacky,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``Yours is not the
only family that was of `count in wold days. Look at the Anktells,
and Horseys, and the Tringhams themselves--gone to seed a`most as
much as you--though you was bigger folks than they, that's true.
Thank God, I was never of no family, and have nothing to be ashamed
of in that way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you be so sure o' that. From you nater `tis my belief you've
disgraced yourselves more than any o' us, and was kings and queens
outright at one time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
own mind at the moment than thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ancestry--<div class="bookquote">``I am afraid
father won't be able to take the journey with the beehives to-morrow
so early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? I shall be all right in an hour or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Durbeyfield.


<p/>It was eleven o'clock before the family were all in bed, and
two o'clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with
the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in
Casterbridge before the Saturday market began, the way thither lying
by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles, and
the horse and waggon being of the slowest. At half-past one Mrs
Durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where Tess and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
little brothers and sisters slept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor man can't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eldest daughter, whose great
eyes had opened the moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's hand touched the door.

<p/>Tess sat up in bed, lost in a vague interspace between a dream and
this information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But somebody must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``It is late for the hives
already. Swarming will soon be over for the year; and it we put off
taking 'em till next week's market the call for 'em will be past, and
they'll be thrown on our hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency. <div class="bookquote">``Some young feller,
perhaps, would go? One of them who were so much after dancing with
`ee yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) presently suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--I wouldn't have it for the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>declared Tess proudly.
<div class="bookquote">``And letting everybody know the reason--such a thing to be ashamed
of! I think _I_ could go if Abraham could go with me to kip me
company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother at length agreed to this arrangement. Little Abraham was
aroused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment, and
made to put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) clothes while still mentally in the other world.
Meanwhile Tess had hastily dressed herself; and the twain, lighting
a lantern, went out to the stable. The rickety little waggon was
already laden, and the girl led out the horse, Prince, only a degree
less rickety than the vehicle.

<p/>The poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night, at the
lantern, at their two figures, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could not believe that at
that hour, when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and
at rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was called upon to go out and labour. They put a stock
of candle-ends into the lantern, hung the latter to the off-side of
the load, and directed the horse onward, walking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) shoulder at
first during the uphill parts of the way, in order not to overload
an animal of so little vigour. To cheer themselves as well as they
could, they made an artificial morning with the lantern, some bread
and butter, and their own conversation, the real morning being far
from come. Abraham, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) more fully awoke -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) had moved in a
sort of trance so far-RRB-, began to talk of the strange shapes assumed
by the various dark objects against the sky; of this tree that looked
like a raging tiger springing from a lair; of that which resembled a
giant's head.

<p/>When they had passed the little town of Stourcastle, dumbly somnolent
under its thick brown thatch, they reached higher ground. Still
higher, on their left, the elevation called Bulbarrow, or Bealbarrow,
well-nigh the highest in South Wessex, swelled into the sky,
engirdled by its earthen trenches. From hereabout the long road was
fairly level for some distance onward. They mounted in front of the
waggon, and Abraham grew reflective.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) said in a preparatory tone, after a silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Abraham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bain't you glad that we've become gentlefolk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not particular glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you be glad that you 'm going to marry a gentleman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That our great relation will help `ee to marry a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? Our great relation? We have no such relation. What has put
that into your head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard 'em talking about it up at Rolliver's when I went to find
father. There's a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge, and
mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d put `ee in
the way of marrying a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) sister became abruptly still, and lapsed into a pondering
silence. Abraham talked on, rather for the pleasure of utterance
than for audition, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) sister's abstraction was of no
account. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) leant back against the hives, and with upturned face
made observations on the stars, whose cold pulses were beating
amid the black hollows above, in serene dissociation from these two
wisps of human life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) asked how far away those twinklers were,
and whether God was on the other side of them. But ever and anon
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) childish prattle recurred to what impressed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) imagination
even more deeply than the wonders of creation. If Tess were made
rich by marrying a gentleman, would she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) have money enough to buy a
spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as
Nettlecombe-Tout?

<p/>The renewed subject, which seemed to have impregnated the whole
family, filled Tess with impatience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you say the stars were worlds, Tess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All like ours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; but I think so. They sometimes seem to be like the
apples on our stubbard-tree. Most of them splendid and sound--a few
blighted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which do we live on--a splendid one or a blighted one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A blighted one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis very unlucky that we didn't pitch on a sound one, when there
were so many more of 'em!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it like that REALLY, Tess?''  (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div>said Abraham, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) much
impressed, on reconsideration of this rare information. <div class="bookquote">``How would
it have been if we had pitched on a sound one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, father wouldn't have coughed and creeped about as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does,
and wouldn't have got too tipsy to go on this journey; and mother
wouldn't have been always washing, and never getting finished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would have been a rich lady ready-made, and not have had to
be made rich by marrying a gentleman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Aby, don't--don't talk of that any more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div><p/>Left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) reflections Abraham soon grew drowsy. Tess was not
skilful in the management of a horse, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and
allow Abraham to go to sleep if he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) wished to do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) a
sort of nest in front of the hives, in such a manner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) could
not fall, and, taking the reins into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own hands, jogged on as
before.

<p/>Prince required but slight attention, lacking energy for superfluous
movements of any sort. With no longer a companion to distract her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),
Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) back leaning
against the hives. The mute procession past her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shoulders of trees
and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality, and
the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad
soul, conterminous with the universe in space, and with history in
time.

<p/>Then, examining the mesh of events in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seemed to see
the vanity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's pride; the gentlemanly suitor awaiting
herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's fancy; to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as a grimacing personage,
laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) poverty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shrouded knightly ancestry.
Everything grew more and more extravagant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) no longer knew how
time passed. A sudden jerk shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seat, and Tess awoke
from the sleep into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), too, had fallen.

<p/>They were a long way further on than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had lost consciousness,
and the waggon had stopped. A hollow groan, unlike anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
ever heard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life, came from the front, followed by a shout of
<div class="bookquote">``Hoi there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The lantern hanging at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) waggon had gone out, but another was
shining in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face--much brighter than her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own had been. Something
terrible had happened. The harness was entangled with an object
which blocked the way.

<p/>In consternation Tess jumped down, and discovered the dreadful truth.
The groan had proceeded from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's poor horse Prince. The
morning mail-cart, with its two noiseless wheels, speeding along
these lanes like an arrow, as it always did, had driven into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) slow
and unlighted equipage. The pointed shaft of the cart had entered
the breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and from the wound his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
life's blood was spouting in a stream, and falling with a hiss into
the road.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) despair Tess sprang forward and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand upon the hole,
with the only result that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) became splashed from face to skirt with
the crimson drops. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stood helplessly looking on. Prince
also stood firm and motionless as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could; till he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) suddenly
sank down in a heap.

<p/>By this time the mail-cart man had joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and began dragging and
unharnessing the hot form of Prince. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was already dead, and,
seeing that nothing more could be done immediately, the mail-cart man
returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own animal, which was uninjured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was on the wrong side,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am bound to go on with the
mail-bags, so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with
your load. I'll send somebody to help you as soon as I can. It is
getting daylight, and you have nothing to fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mounted and sped on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way; while Tess stood and waited. The
atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges,
arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and
Tess showed hers, still whiter. The huge pool of blood in front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation; and when the
sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. Prince lay
alongside, still and stark; his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) eyes half open, the hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) chest
looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis all my doing--all mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>the girl cried, gazing at the
spectacle. <div class="bookquote">``No excuse for me--none. What will mother and father
live on now? Aby, Aby!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shook the child, who had slept soundly
through the whole disaster. <div class="bookquote">``We can't go on with our load--Prince
is killed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div><p/>When Abraham realized all, the furrows of fifty years were
extemporized on his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) young face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I danced and laughed only yesterday!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went on to herself.
<div class="bookquote">``To think that I was such a fool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one, isn't
it, Tess?''  (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div>murmured Abraham through his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) tears.

<p/>In silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless. At
length a sound, and an approaching object, proved to them that the
driver of the mail-car had been as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) word. A farmer's
man from near Stourcastle came up, leading a strong cob. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the
load taken on towards Casterbridge.

<p/>The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the
spot of the accident. Prince had lain there in the ditch since the
morning; but the place of the blood-pool was still visible in the
middle of the road, though scratched and scraped over by passing
vehicles. All that was left of Prince was now hoisted into the
waggon he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had formerly hauled, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hoofs in the air, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
shoes shining in the setting sunlight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) retraced the eight or nine
miles to Marlott.

<p/>Tess had gone back earlier. How to break the news was more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
could think. It was a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tongue to find from the faces of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents that they already knew of their loss, though this did not
lessen the self-reproach which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) continued to heap upon herself for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) negligence.

<p/>But the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune
a less terrifying one to them than it would have been to a thriving
family, though in the present case it meant ruin, and in the other it
would only have meant inconvenience. In the Durbeyfield countenances
there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the
girl from parents more ambitious for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) welfare. Nobody blamed Tess
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) blamed herself.

<p/>When it was discovered that the knacker and tanner would give only a
very few shillings for Prince's carcase because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) decrepitude,
Durbeyfield rose to the occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stoically, ``I won't sell his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) old body. When we
d<div class="bookquote">``Urbervilles was knights in the land, we didn't sell our chargers
for cat's meat. Let 'em keep their shillings! He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'ve served me well
in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) lifetime, and I won't part from him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) worked harder the next day in digging a grave for Prince in the
garden than he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had worked for months to grow a crop for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) family.
When the hole was ready, Durbeyfield and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife tied a rope round
the horse and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) up the path towards it, the children
following in funeral train. Abraham and ``Liza-Lu sobbed, Hope and
Modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the
walls; and when Prince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave.
The bread-winner had been taken away from them; what would they do?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) gone to heaven?''  (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div>asked Abraham, between the sobs.

<p/>Then Durbeyfield began to shovel in the earth, and the children cried
anew. All except Tess. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face was dry and pale, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
regarded herself in the light of a murderess.



<p/>V


<p/>The haggling business, which had mainly depended on the horse, became
disorganized forthwith. Distress, if not penury, loomed in the
distance. Durbeyfield was what was locally called a slack-twisted
fellow; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had good strength to work at times; but the times could
not be relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement; and,
having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the day-labourer,
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was not particularly persistent when they did so coincide.

<p/>Tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents into this
quagmire, was silently wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could do to help them out
of it; and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother broached her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) scheme.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must take the ups wi' the downs, Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); ``and never
could your high blood have been found out at a more called-for
moment. You must try your friends. Do ye know that there is a very
rich Mrs d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville living on the outskirts o' The Chase, who must
be our relation? You must go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) and claim kin, and ask for some
help in our trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't care to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>says Tess. <div class="bookquote">``If there is such a lady,
`twould be enough for us if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were friendly--not to expect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to
give us help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could win her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) round to do anything, my dear. Besides, perhaps
there's more in it than you know of. I've heard what I've heard,
good-now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The oppressive sense of the harm she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had done led Tess to be more
deferential than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might otherwise have been to the maternal
wish; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not understand why her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother should find such
satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), such doubtful
profit. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother might have made inquiries, and have discovered
that this Mrs d``Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and
charity. But Tess's pride made the part of poor relation one of
particular distaste to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather try to get work,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Durbeyfield, you can settle it,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wife, turning to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
sat in the background. <div class="bookquote">``If you say she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ought to go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) will go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like my children going and making themselves beholden to
strange kin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>murmured he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm the head of the noblest branch o'
the family, and I ought to live up to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own
objections to going. <div class="bookquote">``Well, as I killed the horse, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said
mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I ought to do something. I don't mind going
and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but you must leave it to me about asking for help.
And don't go thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) making a match for me--it is silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well said, Tess!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father sententiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who said I had such a thought?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>asked Joan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy it is in your mind, mother. But I'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Rising early next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walked to the hill-town called Shaston,
and there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from
Shaston eastward to Chaseborough, passing near Trantridge, the parish
in which the vague and mysterious Mrs d``Urberville had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) residence.

<p/>Tess Durbeyfield's route on this memorable morning lay amid the
north-eastern undulations of the Vale in which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been born, and
in which her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life had unfolded. The Vale of Blackmoor was to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the
world, and its inhabitants the races thereof. From the gates and
stiles of Marlott she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had looked down its length in the wondering
days of infancy, and what had been mystery to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) then was not
much less than mystery to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) now. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had seen daily from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
chamber-window towers, villages, faint white mansions; above all,
the town of Shaston standing majestically on its height; its windows
shining like lamps in the evening sun. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had hardly ever visited
the place, only a small tract even of the Vale and its environs being
known to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by close inspection. Much less had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) been far outside
the valley. Every contour of the surrounding hills was as personal
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as that of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) relatives' faces; but for what lay beyond, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
judgment was dependent on the teaching of the village school, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had held a leading place at the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) leaving, a year or
two before this date.

<p/>In those early days she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been much loved by others of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own
sex and age, and had used to be seen about the village as one of
three--all nearly of the same year--walking home from school side
by side; Tess the middle one--in a pink print pinafore, of a finely
reticulated pattern, worn over a stuff frock that had lost its
original colour for a nondescript tertiary--marching on upon long
stalky legs, in tight stockings which had little ladder-like holes
at the knees, torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of
vegetable and mineral treasures; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) then earth-coloured hair hanging
like pot-hooks; the arms of the two outside girls resting round the
waist of Tess; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arms on the shoulders of the two supporters.

<p/>As Tess grew older, and began to see how matters stood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt
quite a Malthusian towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother for thoughtlessly giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) so
many little sisters and brothers, when it was such a trouble to nurse
and provide for them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) mother's intelligence was that of a happy
child: Joan Durbeyfield was simply an additional one, and that not
the eldest, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) own long family of waiters on Providence.

<p/>However, Tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones,
and to help them as much as possible she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) used, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) left
school, to lend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring
farms; or, by preference, at milking or butter-making processes,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had learnt when her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father had owned cows; and being
deft-fingered it was a kind of work in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) excelled.

<p/>Every day seemed to throw upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) young shoulders more of the
family burdens, and that Tess should be the representative of the
Durbeyfields at the d``Urberville mansion came as a thing of course.
In this instance it must be admitted that the Durbeyfields were
putting their fairest side outward.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) alighted from the van at Trantridge Cross, and ascended on foot
a hill in the direction of the district known as The Chase, on the
borders of which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been informed, Mrs d``Urberville's seat,
The Slopes, would be found. It was not a manorial home in the
ordinary sense, with fields, and pastures, and a grumbling farmer,
out of whom the owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
family by hook or by crook. It was more, far more; a country-house
built for enjoyment pure and simple, with not an acre of troublesome
land attached to it beyond what was required for residential
purposes, and for a little fancy farm kept in hand by the owner, and
tended by a bailiff.

<p/>The crimson brick lodge came first in sight, up to its eaves in dense
evergreens. Tess thought this was the mansion itself till, passing
through the side wicket with some trepidation, and onward to a point
at which the drive took a turn, the house proper stood in full view.
It was of recent erection--indeed almost new--and of the same rich
red colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the
lodge. Far behind the corner of the house--which rose like a
geranium bloom against the subdued colours around--stretched the soft
azure landscape of The Chase--a truly venerable tract of forest land,
one of the few remaining woodlands in England of undoubted primaeval
date, wherein Druidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks, and
where enormous yew-trees, not planted by the hand of man grew as
they had grown when they were pollarded for bows. All this sylvan
antiquity, however, though visible from The Slopes, was outside the
immediate boundaries of the estate.

<p/>Everything on this snug property was bright, thriving, and well kept;
acres of glass-houses stretched down the inclines to the copses at
their feet. Everything looked like money--like the last coin issued
from the Mint. The stables, partly screened by Austrian pines
and evergreen oaks, and fitted with every late appliance, were
as dignified as Chapels-of-Ease. On the extensive lawn stood an
ornamental tent, its door being towards her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>).

<p/>Simple Tess Durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a half-alarmed attitude,
on the edge of the gravel sweep. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) feet had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) onward to
this point before she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had quite realized where she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was; and now all
was contrary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) expectation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought we were an old family; but this is all new!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) said, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) artlessness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had not fallen in so readily
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) mother's plans for <div class="bookquote">``claiming kin,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>and had endeavoured to
gain assistance nearer home.


<p/>The d``Urbervilles--or Stoke-d``Urbervilles, as they at first called
themselves--who owned all this, were a somewhat unusual family to
find in such an old-fashioned part of the country. Parson Tringham
had spoken truly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) said that our shambling John Durbeyfield was
the only really lineal representative of the old d``Urberville family
existing in the county, or near it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) might have added, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) knew
very well, that the Stoke-d``Urbervilles were no more d``Urbervilles of
the true tree then he (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) was himself. Yet it must be admitted that this
family formed a very good stock whereon to regraft a name which sadly
wanted such renovation.

<p/>When old Mr Simon Stoke, latterly deceased, had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) fortune as
an honest merchant -LRB-some said money-lender-RRB- in the North, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) decided
to settle as a county man in the South of England, out of hail of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) business district; and in doing this he (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) felt the necessity of
recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) with
the smart tradesman of the past, and that would be less commonplace
than the original bald, stark words. Conning for an hour in the
British Museum the pages of works devoted to extinct, half-extinct,
obscured, and ruined families appertaining to the quarter of England
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) proposed to settle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) considered that _d``Urberville_
looked and sounded as well as any of them: and d``Urberville
accordingly was annexed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) own name for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) heirs
eternally. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) was not an extravagant-minded man in this, and in
constructing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in
framing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stoke</b></font>) inter-marriages and aristocratic links, never inserting
a single title above a rank of strict moderation.

<p/>Of this work of imagination poor Tess and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents were naturally
in ignorance--much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very
possibility of such annexations was unknown to them; who supposed
that, though to be well-favoured might be the gift of fortune, a
family name came by nature.

<p/>Tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his (<font color='blue'><b>bather</b></font>) plunge,
hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere, when a figure came
forth from the dark triangular door of the tent. It was that of a
tall young man, smoking.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had an almost swarthy complexion, with full lips, badly moulded,
though red and smooth, above which was a well-groomed black moustache
with curled points, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age could not be more than three- or
four-and-twenty. Despite the touches of barbarism in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contours,
there was a singular force in the gentleman's face, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bold
rolling eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my Beauty, what can I do for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), coming forward.
And perceiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) stood quite confounded: ``Never mind me. I am
Mr d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville. Have you come to see me or my mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This embodiment of a d``Urberville and a namesake differed even more
from what Tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had dreamed of an aged and dignified face, the sublimation of
all the d``Urberville lineaments, furrowed with incarnate memories
representing in hieroglyphic the centuries of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) family's and
England's history. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) screwed herself up to the work in hand,
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not get out of it, and answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to see your mother, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you cannot see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is an invalid,''  (<font color='red'><b>the representative</b></font>)</div>replied the
present representative of the spurious house; for this was Mr Alec,
the only son of the lately deceased gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Cannot I answer your
purpose? What is the business you wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't business--it is--I can hardly say what!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no. Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's sense of a certain ludicrousness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) errand was now
so strong that, notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) general
discomfort at being here, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rosy lips curved towards a smile,
much to the attraction of the swarthy Alexander.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so very foolish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stammered; <div class="bookquote">``I fear can't tell you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind; I like foolish things. Try again, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>)
kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother asked me to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Tess continued; <div class="bookquote">``and, indeed, I was in the
mind to do so myself likewise. But I did not think it would be like
this. I came, sir, to tell you that we are of the same family as
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! Poor relations?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stokes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; d'Urbervilles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay; I mean d'Urbervilles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but we have several proofs
that we are d<div class="bookquote">``Urbervilles. Antiquarians hold we are,--and--and we
have an old seal, marked with a ramping lion on a shield, and a
castle over him (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>). And we have a very old silver spoon, round in the

is so worn that mother uses it to stir the pea-soup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A castle argent is certainly my crest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) blandly. <div class="bookquote">``And my

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so mother said we ought to make ourselves beknown to you--as

her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) step.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alec</b></font>)</div>Alec looked at Tess as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) spoke, in a way that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
blush a little. <div class="bookquote">``And so, my pretty girl, you've come on a friendly
visit to us, as relations?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>faltered Tess, looking uncomfortable again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--there's no harm in it. Where do you live? What are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) brief particulars; and responding to further inquiries
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was intending to go back by the same carrier who
had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a long while before he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) returns past Trantridge Cross.
Supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty Coz?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess wished to abridge her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) visit as much as possible; but the young
man was pressing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) consented to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conducted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) about the lawns, and flower-beds, and conservatories; and thence
to the fruit-garden and greenhouses, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) liked
strawberries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, <div class="bookquote">``when they come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are already here.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>D``Urberville began gathering specimens
of the fruit for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), handing them back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Coz</b></font>) stooped; and,
presently, selecting a specially fine product of the <div class="bookquote">``British Queen''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>variety, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up and held it by the stem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said quickly, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fingers between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather take it in my own hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insisted; and in a slight distress she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips
and took it in.

<p/>They had spent some time wandering desultorily thus, Tess eating in
a half-pleased, half-reluctant state whatever d``Urberville offered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) could consume no more of the strawberries he (<font color='blue'><b>Coz</b></font>) filled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) little basket with them; and then the two passed round to the
rose-trees, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Coz</b></font>) gathered blossoms and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) to put in her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
bosom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) obeyed like one in a dream, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) could affix no
more he (<font color='blue'><b>Coz</b></font>) himself tucked a bud or two into her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hat, and heaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
basket with others in the prodigality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Coz</b></font>) bounty. At last,
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Coz</b></font>) watch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Coz</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, by the time you have had
something to eat, it will be time for you to leave, if you want to
catch the carrier to Shaston. Come here, and I'll see what grub I
can find.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stoke</b></font>)</div><p/>Stoke d``Urberville took her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) back to the lawn and into the tent, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Coz</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>), soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Coz</b></font>) put before her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) himself. It was evidently the gentleman's wish not
to be disturbed in this pleasant _tête-à-tête_ by the servantry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mind my smoking?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not at all, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of
smoke that pervaded the tent, and Tess Durbeyfield did not divine,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) innocently looked down at the roses in her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) bosom, that there
behind the blue narcotic haze was potentially the <div class="bookquote">``tragic mischief''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) drama--one who stood fair to be the blood-red ray in the
spectrum of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) young life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had an attribute which amounted
to a disadvantage just now; and it was this that caused Alec
d``Urberville's eyes to rivet themselves upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>). It was a
luxuriance of aspect, a fulness of growth, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) appear more
of a woman than she (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) really was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) had inherited the feature from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) mother without the quality it denoted. It had troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) mind
occasionally, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) companions had said that it was a fault which
time would cure.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) soon had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) lunch. <div class="bookquote">``Now I am going home, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
said, rising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do they call you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) asked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) along
the drive till they were out of sight of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess Durbeyfield, down at Marlott.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you say your people have lost their horse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) answered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) eyes filling with tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
gave particulars of Prince's death. <div class="bookquote">``And I don't know what to do
for father on account of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I must think if I cannot do something. My mother must find a berth
for you. But, Tess, no nonsense about <div class="bookquote">``d'Urberville';--`Durbeyfield'
only, you know--quite another name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish for no better, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) with something of dignity.

<p/>For a moment--only for a moment--when they were in the turning of the
drive, between the tall rhododendrons and conifers, before the lodge
became visible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) face towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) as if--but, no: he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
thought better of it, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) go.

<p/>Thus the thing began. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) perceived this meeting's import she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
might have asked why she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was doomed to be seen and coveted that day
by the wrong man, and not by some other man, the right and desired
one in all respects--as nearly as humanity can supply the right
and desired; yet to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who amongst her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) acquaintance might have
approximated to this kind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was but a transient impression, half
forgotten.

<p/>In the ill-judged execution of the well-judged plan of things the
call seldom produces the comer, the man to love rarely coincides with
the hour for loving. Nature does not often say <div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>creature</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) poor
creature at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing; or reply
<div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>creature</b></font>)</div>to a body's cry of <div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>till the hide-and-seek has become
an irksome, outworn game. We may wonder whether at the acme and
summit of the human progress these anachronisms will be corrected by
a finer intuition, a closer interaction of the social machinery than
that which now jolts us round and along; but such completeness is not
to be prophesied, or even conceived as possible. Enough that in the
present case, as in millions, it was not the two halves of a perfect
whole that confronted each other at the perfect moment; a missing
counterpart wandered independently about the earth waiting in
crass obtuseness till the late time came. Out of which maladroit
delay sprang anxieties, disappointments, shocks, catastrophes, and
passing-strange destinies.

<p/>When d``Urberville got back to the tent he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat down astride on a
chair, reflecting, with a pleased gleam in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) broke
into a loud laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm damned! What a funny thing! Ha-ha-ha! And what a crumby
girl!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>VI


<p/>Tess went down the hill to Trantridge Cross, and inattentively waited
to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seat in the van returning from Chaseborough to Shaston.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not know what the other occupants said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) entered,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered them; and when they had started anew she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rode
along with an inward and not an outward eye.

<p/>One among her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fellow-travellers addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) more pointedly than
any had spoken before: <div class="bookquote">``Why, you be quite a posy! And such roses in
early June!''

 (<font color='red'><b>fellow-travellers</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) became aware of the spectacle she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) presented to their
surprised vision: roses at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) breasts; roses in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hat; roses
and strawberries in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) basket to the brim. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) blushed, and
said confusedly that the flowers had been given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). When the
passengers were not looking she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stealthily removed the more prominent
blooms from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hat and placed them in the basket, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) covered
them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) handkerchief. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fell to reflecting again, and
in looking downwards a thorn of the rose remaining in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) breast
accidentally pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) chin. Like all the cottagers in Blackmoor
Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought this an ill omen--the first she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had noticed that day.

<p/>The van travelled only so far as Shaston, and there were several
miles of pedestrian descent from that mountain-town into the vale to
Marlott. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother had advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to stay here for the night, at
the house of a cottage-woman they knew, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) should feel too tired
to come on; and this Tess did, not descending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) home till the
following afternoon.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) entered the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) perceived in a moment from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
mother's triumphant manner that something had occurred in the
interim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; I know all about it! I told `ee it would be all right, and
now `tis proved!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since I've been away? What has?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess rather wearily.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval, and went
on banteringly: <div class="bookquote">``So you've brought 'em round!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess then remembered that there would have been time for this.

<p/>``They say--Mrs d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville says--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) wants you to look after a
little fowl-farm which is her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) hobby. But this is only her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) artful way
of getting `ee there without raising your hopes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>)'s going to own
`ee as kin--that's the meaning o`t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I didn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>kin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You zid somebody, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own `ee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) called me Coz.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An' I knew it! Jacky--he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) Coz!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>cried Joan to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)
husband. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, of course, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) do want
`ee there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't know that I am apt at tending fowls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said the dubious
Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't know who is apt. You've be'n born in the business, and
brought up in it. They that be born in a business always know more
about it than any `prentice. Besides, that's only just a show of
something for you to do, that you midn't feel beholden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't altogether think I ought to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess thoughtfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Who wrote the letter? Will you let me look at it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Mrs d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville wrote it. Here it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div><p/>The letter was in the third person, and briefly informed Mrs
Durbeyfield that her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) daughter's services would be useful to that lady
in the management of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) poultry-farm, that a comfortable room would
be provided for her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) could come, and that the wages would be on
a liberal scale if they liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--that's all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) arms round `ee, an' to kiss and
to coll `ee all at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess looked out of the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather stay here with father and you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather not tell you why, mother; indeed, I don't quite know
why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A week afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came in one evening from an unavailing search
for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) idea
had been to get together sufficient money during the summer to
purchase another horse. Hardly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) crossed the threshold before
one of the children danced across the room, saying, <div class="bookquote">``The gentleman's
been here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother hastened to explain, smiles breaking from every inch of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) person. Mrs d``Urberville's son had called on horseback, having
been riding by chance in the direction of Marlott. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had wished
to know, finally, in the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, if Tess could really
come to manage the old lady's fowl-farm or not; the lad who had
hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy. ``Mr
d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you
appear; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) knows you must be worth your weight in gold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) is very
much interested in `ee--truth to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had won
such high opinion from a stranger when, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own esteem, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
sunk so low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very good of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) to think that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured; <div class="bookquote">``and if I was
quite sure how it would be living there, I would go any-when.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) is a mighty handsome man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's your chance, whether or no; and I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) wears a
beautiful diamond ring!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div>said little Abraham, brightly, from the window-bench; <div class="bookquote">``and
I seed it! and it did twinkle when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) hand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)
mistarshers. Mother, why did our grand relation keep on putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)
hand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) mistarshers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark at that child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Durbeyfield, with parenthetic
admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) diamond ring,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/St John</b></font>)</div>murmured Sir John, dreamily, from
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll think it over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, leaving the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s made a conquest o' the younger branch of us, straight
off,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>continued the matron to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s a fool if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) go, Jacky,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>coaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) poor witless wife. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s

her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), most likely, and make a lady of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>); and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'ll be what
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) forefathers was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>John Durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health, and this
supposition was pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>).

<p/>``Well, perhaps that's what young Mr d``Urberville means,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) admitted;
<div class="bookquote">``and sure enough he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) mid have serious thoughts about improving his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)
blood by linking on to the old line. Tess, the little rogue! And
have she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) really paid 'em a visit to such an end as this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile Tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry-bushes
in the garden, and over Prince's grave. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother
pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) advantage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what be you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had seen Mrs d'Urberville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you mid as well settle it. Then you'll see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) soon
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father coughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to say!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the girl restlessly. ``It is for
you to decide. I killed the old horse, and I suppose I ought to do
something to get ye a new one. But--but--I don't quite like Mr
d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville being there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The children</b></font>)</div><p/>The children, who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by
their wealthy kinsfolk -LRB-which they imagined the other family to be-RRB-
as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began to cry
at Tess's reluctance, and teased and reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) for hesitating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess won't go-o-o and be made a la-a-dy of!--no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
wo-o-on`t!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they wailed, with square mouths. <div class="bookquote">``And we shan't have a
nice new horse, and lots o' golden money to buy fairlings! And Tess
won't look pretty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) best cloze no mo-o-ore!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had of
making her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) labours in the house seem heavier than they were by
prolonging them indefinitely, also weighed in the argument. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess at last.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother could not repress her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) consciousness of the nuptial vision
conjured up by the girl's consent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right! For such a pretty maid as `tis, this is a fine
chance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess smiled crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it is a chance for earning money. It is no other kind of
chance. You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was not quite sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did
not feel proud enough, after the visitor's remarks, to say a good
deal.

<p/>Thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready
to set out on any day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might be required. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was duly
informed that Mrs d``Urberville was glad of her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) decision, and that a
spring-cart should be sent to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) luggage at the top
of the Vale on the day after the morrow, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) must hold herself
prepared to start. Mrs d``Urberville's handwriting seemed rather
masculine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A cart?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly. <div class="bookquote">``It might have been
a carriage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) own kin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Having at last taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) course Tess was less restless and
abstracted, going about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) business with some self-assurance in the
thought of acquiring another horse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father by an occupation
which would not be onerous. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had hoped to be a teacher at the
school, but the fates seemed to decide otherwise. Being mentally
older than her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not regard Mrs Durbeyfield's
matrimonial hopes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) in a serious aspect for a moment. The
light-minded woman had been discovering good matches for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter
almost from the year of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) birth.



<p/>VII


<p/>On the morning appointed for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) departure Tess was awake before
dawn--at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still
mute, save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear-voiced
conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at least knows the correct time of day, the rest
preserving silence as if equally convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) is mistaken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
remained upstairs packing till breakfast-time, and then came down in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ordinary week-day clothes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) Sunday apparel being carefully
folded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) box.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother expostulated. <div class="bookquote">``You will never set out to see your folks
without dressing up more the dand than that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am going to work!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Durbeyfield; and in a private tone, <div class="bookquote">``at first
there mid be a little pretence o't ... But I think it will be wiser
of `ee to put your best side outward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; I suppose you know best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>replied Tess with calm
abandonment.

<p/>And to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parent the girl put herself quite in Joan's hands,
saying serenely--<div class="bookquote">``Do what you like with me, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability.
First she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) fetched a great basin, and washed Tess's hair with such
thoroughness that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as
at other times. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) put upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) the white frock that Tess had worn at the
club-walking, the airy fulness of which, supplementing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) enlarged
_coiffure_, imparted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) developing figure an amplitude which
belied her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) age, and might cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to be estimated as a woman when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was not much more than a child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare there's a hole in my stocking-heel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind holes in your stockings--they don't speak! When I was a
maid, so long as I had a pretty bonnet the devil might ha' found me
in heels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's pride in the girl's appearance led her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to step back,
like a painter from his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) easel, and survey her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) work as a whole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must zee yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``It is much better than you was
t`other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>As the looking-glass was only large enough to reflect a very small
portion of Tess's person at one time, Mrs Durbeyfield hung a black
cloak outside the casement, and so made a large reflector of the
panes, as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do. After this
she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) went downstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) husband, who was sitting in the lower
room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell `ee what `tis, Durbeyfield,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) exultingly; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'ll
never have the heart not to love her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). But whatever you do, don't zay
too much to Tess of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) fancy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and this chance she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) has got.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) is such an odd maid that it mid zet her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), or against
going there, even now. If all goes well, I shall certainly be for
making some return to pa`son at Stagfoot Lane for telling us--dear,
good man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>However, as the moment for the girl's setting out drew nigh, when the
first excitement of the dressing had passed off, a slight misgiving
found place in Joan Durbeyfield's mind. It prompted the matron to
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) would walk a little way--as far as to the point where
the acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to
the outer world. At the top Tess was going to be met with the
spring-cart sent by the Stoke-d``Urbervilles, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) box had already
been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in
readiness.

<p/>Seeing their mother put on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bonnet, the younger children clamoured
to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do want to walk a little-ways wi' Sissy, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>)'s going to marry
our gentleman-cousin, and wear fine cloze!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, flushing and turning quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I'll hear no more o'
that! Mother, how could you ever put such stuff into their heads?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to work, my dears, for our rich relation, and help get enough
money for a new horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Durbeyfield pacifically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodbye, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, with a lumpy throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodbye, my maid,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/St John</b></font>)</div>said Sir John, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) breast
as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) suspended his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nap, induced by a slight excess this morning in
honour of the occasion. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope my young friend will like such
a comely sample of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own blood. And tell`n, Tess, that being sunk,
quite, from our former grandeur, I'll sell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the title--yes, sell
it--and at no onreasonable figure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for less than a thousand pound!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Durbeyfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell`n--I'll take a thousand pound. Well, I'll take less, when
I come to think o`t. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll adorn it better than a poor lammicken
feller like myself can. Tell'n he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shall hae it for a hundred. But
I won't stand upon trifles--tell'n he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shall hae it for fifty--for
twenty pound! Yes, twenty pound--that's the lowest. Dammy, family
honour is family honour, and I won't take a penny less!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's eyes were too full and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) voice too choked to utter the
sentiments that were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned quickly, and went out.

<p/>So the girls and their mother all walked together, a child on each
side of Tess, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) meditatively from
time to time, as at one who was about to do great things; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother
just behind with the smallest; the group forming a picture of honest
beauty flanked by innocence, and backed by simple-souled vanity.
They followed the way till they reached the beginning of the ascent,
on the crest of which the vehicle from Trantridge was to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),
this limit having been fixed to save the horse the labour of the last
slope. Far away behind the first hills the cliff-like dwellings
of Shaston broke the line of the ridge. Nobody was visible in the
elevated road which skirted the ascent save the lad whom they had
sent on before them, sitting on the handle of the barrow that
contained all Tess's worldly possessions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bide here a bit, and the cart will soon come, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Mrs
Durbeyfield. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I see it yonder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>It had come--appearing suddenly from behind the forehead of the
nearest upland, and stopping beside the boy with the barrow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
mother and the children thereupon decided to go no farther, and
bidding them a hasty goodbye, Tess bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) steps up the hill.

<p/>They saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) white shape draw near to the spring-cart, on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
box was already placed. But before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had quite reached it another
vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit, came round the
bend of the road there, passed the luggage-cart, and halted beside
Tess, who looked up as if in great surprise.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother perceived, for the first time, that the second vehicle was
not a humble conveyance like the first, but a spick-and-span gig or
dog-cart, highly varnished and equipped. The driver was a young man
of three- or four-and-twenty, with a cigar between his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) teeth; wearing
a dandy cap, drab jacket, breeches of the same hue, white neckcloth,
stick-up collar, and brown driving-gloves--in short, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was the
handsome, horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before
to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) answer about Tess.

<p/>Mrs Durbeyfield clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) hands like a child. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) looked
down, then stared again. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) be deceived as to the meaning of
this?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is dat the gentleman-kinsman who'll make Sissy a lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>asked the
youngest child.

<p/>Meanwhile the muslined form of Tess could be seen standing still,
undecided, beside this turn-out, whose owner was talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seeming indecision was, in fact, more than indecision: it was
misgiving. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have preferred the humble cart. The young
man dismounted, and appeared to urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to ascend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
face down the hill to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) relatives, and regarded the little group.
Something seemed to quicken her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to a determination; possibly the
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had killed Prince. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) suddenly stepped up; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
mounted beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and immediately whipped on the horse. In a
moment they had passed the slow cart with the box, and disappeared
behind the shoulder of the hill.

<p/>Directly Tess was out of sight, and the interest of the matter as a
drama was at an end, the little ones' eyes filled with tears. The
youngest child said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish poor, poor Tess wasn't gone away to be a
lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>and, lowering the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lips, burst out crying. The
new point of view was infectious, and the next child did likewise,
and then the next, till the whole three of them wailed loud.

<p/>There were tears also in Joan Durbeyfield's eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) turned to
go home. But by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had got back to the village she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was
passively trusting to the favour of accident. However, in bed that
night she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) sighed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) husband asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) what was the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking that perhaps
it would ha' been better if Tess had not gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oughtn't ye to have thought of that before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `tis a chance for the maid--Still, if `twere the doing again,
I wouldn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) go till I had found out whether the gentleman
is really a good-hearted young man and choice over her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
kinswoman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you ought, perhaps, to ha' done that,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/St John</b></font>)</div>snored Sir John.

<p/>Joan Durbeyfield always managed to find consolation somewhere: <div class="bookquote">``Well,
as one of the genuine stock, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) ought to make her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) way with `en, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) plays her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) trump card aright. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) afore he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
will after. For that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s all afire wi' love for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) any eye can
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>``What's her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) trump card? Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville blood, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, stupid; her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) face--as 'twas mine.''



 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>VIII


<p/>Having mounted beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), Alec d``Urberville drove rapidly along
the crest of the first hill, chatting compliments to Tess as they
went, the cart with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) box being left far behind. Rising still, an
immense landscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the
green valley of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) birth, before, a gray country of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew
nothing except from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) first brief visit to Trantridge. Thus they
reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in a
long straight descent of nearly a mile.

<p/>Ever since the accident with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's horse Tess Durbeyfield,
courageous as she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) naturally was, had been exceedingly timid on
wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) began to
get uneasy at a certain recklessness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) conductor's driving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will go down slow, sir, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) said with attempted
unconcern.

<p/>D``Urberville looked round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), nipped his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) cigar with the tips of
his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) large white centre-teeth, and allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) lips to smile slowly of
themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) answered, after another whiff or two, <div class="bookquote">``it isn't a
brave bouncing girl like you who asks that? Why, I always go down at
full gallop. There's nothing like it for raising your spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps you need not now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``there are two to be reckoned with.
It is not me alone. Tib has to be considered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) has a very
queer temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, this mare. I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) looked round at me in a very grim way
just then. Didn't you notice it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't try to frighten me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess stiffly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't. If any living man can manage this horse I can: I
won't say any living man can do it--but if such has the power, I am
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you have such a horse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well may you ask it! It was my fate, I suppose. Tib has killed
one chap; and just after I bought her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nearly killed me. And
then, take my word for it, I nearly killed her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s touchy
still, very touchy; and one's life is hardly safe behind her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were just beginning to descend; and it was evident that the
horse, whether of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own will or of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) -LRB-the latter being the more
likely-RRB-, knew so well the reckless performance expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hardly required a hint from behind.

<p/>Down, down, they sped, the wheels humming like a top, the dog-cart
rocking right and left, its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set
in relation to the line of progress; the figure of the horse rising
and falling in undulations before them. Sometimes a wheel was off
the ground, it seemed, for many yards; sometimes a stone was sent
spinning over the hedge, and flinty sparks from the horse's hoofs
outshone the daylight. The aspect of the straight road enlarged with
their advance, the two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one
rushing past at each shoulder.

<p/>The wind blew through Tess's white muslin to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) very skin, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
washed hair flew out behind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was determined to show no open
fear, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) clutched d``Urberville's rein-arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't touch my arm! We shall be thrown out if you do! Hold on
round my waist!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) waist, and so they reached the bottom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Safe, thank God, in spite of your fooling!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face on
fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess--fie! that's temper!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said d``Urberville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment
you feel yourself our of danger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not considered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been doing; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) were man
or woman, stick or stone, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) involuntary hold on him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). Recovering
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reserve, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sat without replying, and thus they reached the
summit of another declivity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, again!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said d``Urberville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess. <div class="bookquote">``Show more sense, do, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the
county, they must get down again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) retorted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) loosened rein, and away they went a second time. D``Urberville
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as they rocked, and said, in playful raillery:
<div class="bookquote">``Now then, put your arms round my waist again, as you did before, my
Beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess independently, holding on as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
without touching him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips, Tess, or even on
that warmed cheek, and I'll stop--on my honour, I will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess, surprised beyond measure, slid farther back still on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seat,
at which he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) urged the horse anew, and rocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) the more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will nothing else do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried at length, in desperation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
large eyes staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) like those of a wild animal. This dressing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) up so prettily by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother had apparently been to lamentable
purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, dear Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know--very well; I don't mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) panted miserably.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) drew rein, and as they slowed he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was on the point of imprinting
the desired salute, when, as if hardly yet aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own modesty,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dodged aside. His (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) arms being occupied with the reins there was
left him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) no power to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) manoeuvre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, damn it--I'll break both our necks!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>swore her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) capriciously
passionate companion. <div class="bookquote">``So you can go from your word like that, you
young witch, can you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, <div class="bookquote">``I'll not move since you be so determined!
But I--thought you would be kind to me, and protect me, as my
kinsman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kinsman be hanged! Now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't want anybody to kiss me, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) implored, a big
tear beginning to roll down her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face, and the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth
trembling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) attempts not to cry. <div class="bookquote">``And I wouldn't ha' come if
I had known!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was inexorable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sat still, and d``Urberville gave her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) the
kiss of mastery. No sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) done so than she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) flushed with
shame, took out her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) handkerchief, and wiped the spot on her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) cheek
that had been touched by his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) lips. His (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) ardour was nettled at the
sight, for the act on her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) part had been unconsciously done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/>Tess made no reply to this remark, of which, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not
quite comprehend the drift, unheeding the snub she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had administered
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) instinctive rub upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had, in fact, undone the
kiss, as far as such a thing was physically possible. With a dim
sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was vexed she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked steadily ahead as they trotted on
near Melbury Down and Wingreen, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) consternation,
that there was yet another descent to be undergone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall be made sorry for that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resumed, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) injured tone
still remaining, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flourished the whip anew. <div class="bookquote">``Unless, that is,
you agree willingly to let me do it again, and no handkerchief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Very well, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Oh--let me get my hat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At the moment of speaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hat had blown off into the road, their
present speed on the upland being by no means slow. D``Urberville
pulled up, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) would get it for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but Tess was down on the
other side.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned back and picked up the article.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look prettier with it off, upon my soul, if that's possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said, contemplating her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) over the back of the vehicle. <div class="bookquote">``Now then, up
again! What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The hat was in place and tied, but Tess had not stepped forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, revealing the red and ivory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
eye lit in defiant triumph; <div class="bookquote">``not again, if I know it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--you won't get up beside me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I shall walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis five or six miles yet to Trantridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care if `tis dozens. Besides, the cart is behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You artful hussy! Now, tell me--didn't you make that hat blow off
on purpose? I'll swear you did!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) strategic silence confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suspicion.

<p/>Then d``Urberville cursed and swore at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and called her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) everything
he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could think of for the trick. Turning the horse suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) tried
to drive back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and so hem her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in between the gig and the
hedge. But he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could not do this short of injuring her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>cried Tess with spirit, from the top of the hedge into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
scrambled. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like `ee at all! I hate and detest you! I'll
go back to mother, I will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>D``Urberville's bad temper cleared up at sight of hers; and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) laughed
heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I like you all the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Come, let there be
peace. I'll never do it any more against your will. My life upon
it now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Still Tess could not be induced to remount. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not, however,
object to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gig alongside her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); and in this manner, at
a slow pace, they advanced towards the village of Trantridge. From
time to time d``Urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress at
the sight of the tramping he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to undertake by his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
misdemeanour. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might in truth have safely trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) now; but he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
had forfeited her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) confidence for the time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kept on the ground
progressing thoughtfully, as if wondering whether it would be wiser
to return home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) resolve, however, had been taken, and it seemed
vacillating even to childishness to abandon it now, unless for graver
reasons. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) parents, get back her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) box, and
disconcert the whole scheme for the rehabilitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family on
such sentimental grounds?

<p/>A few minutes later the chimneys of The Slopes appeared in view, and
in a snug nook to the right the poultry-farm and cottage of Tess'
destination.



<p/>IX


<p/>The community of fowls to which Tess had been appointed as
supervisor, purveyor, nurse, surgeon, and friend made its
headquarters in an old thatched cottage standing in an enclosure that
had once been a garden, but was now a trampled and sanded square.
The house was overrun with ivy, its chimney being enlarged by the
boughs of the parasite to the aspect of a ruined tower. The lower
rooms were entirely given over to the birds, who walked about them
with a proprietary air, as though the place had been built by
themselves, and not by certain dusty copyholders who now lay east
and west in the churchyard. The descendants of these bygone owners
felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had
so much of their affection, had cost so much of their forefathers'
money, and had been in their possession for several generations
before the d``Urbervilles came and built here, was indifferently
turned into a fowl-house by Mrs Stoke-d``Urberville as soon as the
property fell into hand according to law. <div class="bookquote">'''Twas good enough for
Christians in grandfather's time,''  (<font color='red'><b>generations</b></font>)</div>they said.

<p/>The rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now
resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks. Distracted hens in
coops occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate
agriculturists. The chimney-corner and once-blazing hearth was now
filled with inverted beehives, in which the hens laid their eggs;
while out of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had
carefully shaped with his (<font color='blue'><b>householder</b></font>) spade were torn by the cocks in wildest
fashion.

<p/>The garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall, and
could only be entered through a door.

<p/>When Tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in
altering and improving the arrangements, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) skilled
ideas as the daughter of a professed poulterer, the door in the wall
opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had come
from the manor-house.

<p/>``Mrs d``Urberville wants the fowls as usual,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said; but perceiving
that Tess did not quite understand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``Mis`ess is a old
lady, and blind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blind!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/>Almost before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) misgiving at the news could find time to shape
itself she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) took, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) companion's direction, two of the
most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arms, and followed the
maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion,
which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this
side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of
dumb creatures--feathers floating within view of the front, and
hen-coops standing on the grass.

<p/>In a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a
white-haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a
large cap. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight
has decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and
reluctantly let go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons
long sightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
feathered charges--one sitting on each arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>said Mrs
d``Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will be kind
to them. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person.
Well, where are they? Ah, this is Strut! But he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) is hardly so
lively to-day, is he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) is alarmed at being handled by a stranger,
I suppose. And Phena too--yes, they are a little frightened--aren't
you, dears? But they will soon get used to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in
obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lap,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks,
their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) touch enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to recognize them in a moment, and to discover
if a single feather were crippled or draggled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) handled their
crops, and knew what they had eaten, and if too little or too much;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
mind.

<p/>The birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the
yard, and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens
had been submitted to the old woman--Hamburghs, Bantams, Cochins,
Brahmas, Dorkings, and such other sorts as were in fashion just
then--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
received the bird upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees.

<p/>It reminded Tess of a Confirmation, in which Mrs d``Urberville was the
bishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the
maid-servant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up.
At the end of the ceremony Mrs d``Urberville abruptly asked Tess,
wrinkling and twitching her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face into undulations, <div class="bookquote">``Can you whistle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whistle, Ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, whistle tunes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess could whistle like most other country-girls, though the
accomplishment was one which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not care to profess in genteel
company. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) blandly admitted that such was the fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you will have to practise it every day. I had a lad who did it
very well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has left. I want you to whistle to my bullfinches;
as I cannot see them, I like to hear them, and we teach 'em airs
that way. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) where the cages are, Elizabeth. You must begin
to-morrow, or they will go back in their piping. They have been
neglected these several days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Mr d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville whistled to 'em this morning, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)! Pooh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady's face creased into furrows of repugnance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) made
no further reply.

<p/>Thus the reception of Tess by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fancied kinswoman terminated, and
the birds were taken back to their quarters. The girl's surprise at
Mrs d``Urberville's manner was not great; for since seeing the size of
the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had expected no more. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was far from being aware
that the old lady had never heard a word of the so-called kinship.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman
and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son. But in that, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was mistaken. Mrs d``Urberville
was not the first mother compelled to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) offspring resentfully,
and to be bitterly fond.


<p/>In spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before, Tess
inclined to the freedom and novelty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) new position in the
morning when the sun shone, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was once installed there;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was curious to test her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) powers in the unexpected direction
asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), so as to ascertain her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) chance of retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) post.
As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was alone within the walled garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sat herself
down on a coop, and seriously screwed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth for the
long-neglected practice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) former ability to have
degenerated to the production of a hollow rush of wind through the
lips, and no clear note at all.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) remained fruitlessly blowing and blowing, wondering how she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
could have so grown out of the art which had come by nature, till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) became aware of a movement among the ivy-boughs which cloaked
the garden-wall no less then the cottage. Looking that way she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
beheld a form springing from the coping to the plot. It was Alec
d``Urberville, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not set eyes on since he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) had conducted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) the day before to the door of the gardener's cottage where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had lodgings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my honour!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), ``there was never before such a beautiful
thing in Nature or Art as you look, ``Cousin' Tess -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Cousin' had a
faint ring of mockery-RRB-. I have been watching you from over the
wall--sitting like IM-patience on a monument, and pouting up that
pretty red mouth to whistling shape, and whooing and whooing, and
privately swearing, and never being able to produce a note. Why,
you are quite cross because you can't do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be cross, but I didn't swear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I understand why you are trying--those bullies! My mother
wants you to carry on their musical education. How selfish of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!
As if attending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough
work for any girl. I would flatly refuse, if I were you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wants me particularly to do it, and to be ready by to-morrow
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? Well then--I'll give you a lesson or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, you won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, withdrawing towards the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense; I don't want to touch you. See--I'll stand on this side
of the wire-netting, and you can keep on the other; so you may feel
quite safe. Now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly.
There `tis--so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) suited the action to the word, and whistled a line of <div class="bookquote">``Take, O
take those lips away.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>But the allusion was lost upon Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now try,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said d``Urberville.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attempted to look reserved; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face put on a sculptural
severity. But he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) demand, and at last, to get rid of
him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did put up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips as directed for producing a clear note;
laughing distressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had laughed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with <div class="bookquote">``Try again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
tried--ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound.
The momentary pleasure of success got the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes
enlarged, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) involuntarily smiled in his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it! Now I have started you--you'll go on beautifully.
There--I said I would not come near you; and, in spite of such
temptation as never before fell to mortal man, I'll keep my
word... Tess, do you think my mother a queer old soul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know much of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) yet, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must be, to make you learn to whistle to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
bullfinches. I am rather out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) books just now, but you will be
quite in favour if you treat her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) live-stock well. Good morning. If
you meet with any difficulties and want help here, don't go to the
bailiff, come to me.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in the economy of this _régime_ that Tess Durbeyfield had
undertaken to fill a place. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) first day's experiences were fairly
typical of those which followed through many succeeding days. A
familiarity with Alec d``Urberville's presence--which that young man
carefully cultivated in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by playful dialogue, and by jestingly
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin when they were alone--removed much of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
original shyness of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), without, however, implanting any feeling
which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
more pliable under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands than a mere companionship would have
made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unavoidable dependence upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, and,
through that lady's comparative helplessness, upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in Mrs
d``Urberville's room was no such onerous business when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had
regained the art, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had caught from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) musical mother numerous
airs that suited those songsters admirably. A far more satisfactory
time than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) practised in the garden was this whistling by the
cages each morning. Unrestrained by the young man's presence she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>)
threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) mouth, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) lips near the bars, and piped away in
easeful grace to the attentive listeners.

<p/>Mrs d``Urberville slept in a large four-post bedstead hung with heavy
damask curtains, and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment,
where they flitted about freely at certain hours, and made little
white spots on the furniture and upholstery. Once while Tess was at
the window where the cages were ranged, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lesson as usual,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard a rustling behind the bed. The old lady was
not present, and turning round the girl had an impression that
the toes of a pair of boots were visible below the fringe of the
curtains. Thereupon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whistling became so disjointed that the
listener, if such there were, must have discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suspicion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) presence. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) searched the curtains every morning after that,
but never found anybody within them. Alec d``Urberville had evidently
thought better of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) freak to terrify her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by an ambush of that kind.



<p/>X


<p/>Every village has its idiosyncrasy, its constitution, often its own
code of morality. The levity of some of the younger women in and
about Trantridge was marked, and was perhaps symptomatic of the
choice spirit who ruled The Slopes in that vicinity. The place had
also a more abiding defect; it drank hard. The staple conversation
on the farms around was on the uselessness of saving money; and
smock-frocked arithmeticians, leaning on their ploughs or hoes, would
enter into calculations of great nicety to prove that parish relief
was a fuller provision for a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old age than any which could
result from savings out of their wages during a whole lifetime.

<p/>The chief pleasure of these philosophers lay in going every Saturday
night, when work was done, to Chaseborough, a decayed market-town two
or three miles distant; and, returning in the small hours of the next
morning, to spend Sunday in sleeping off the dyspeptic effects of the
curious compounds sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the
once-independent inns.

<p/>For a long time Tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages. But
under pressure from matrons not much older than herself--for a
field-man's wages being as high at twenty-one as at forty, marriage
was early here--Tess at length consented to go. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) first experience
of the journey afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) more enjoyment than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had expected,
the hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
monotonous attention to the poultry-farm all the week. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went again
and again. Being graceful and interesting, standing moreover on the
momentary threshold of womanhood, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) appearance drew down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
some sly regards from loungers in the streets of Chaseborough; hence,
though sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) journey to the town was made independently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
always searched for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fellows at nightfall, to have the protection
of their companionship homeward.

<p/>This had gone on for a month or two when there came a Saturday in
September, on which a fair and a market coincided; and the pilgrims
from Trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account.
Tess's occupations made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) late in setting out, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) comrades
reached the town long before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). It was a fine September evening,
just before sunset, when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in
hairlike lines, and the atmosphere itself forms a prospect without
aid from more solid objects, except the innumerable winged insects
that dance in it. Through this low-lit mistiness Tess walked
leisurely along.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not discover the coincidence of the market with the fair till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had reached the place, by which time it was close upon dusk. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
limited marketing was soon completed; and then as usual she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) began to
look about for some of the Trantridge cottagers.

<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not find them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was informed that most of
them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house
of a hay-trusser and peat-dealer who had transactions with their
farm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lived in an out-of-the-way nook of the townlet, and in
trying to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) course thither her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes fell upon Mr d``Urberville
standing at a street corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--my Beauty? You here so late?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was simply waiting for company homeward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) shoulder as she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) went on down
the back lane.

<p/>Approaching the hay-trussers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) could hear the fiddled notes of
a reel proceeding from some building in the rear; but no sound of
dancing was audible--an exceptional state of things for these parts,
where as a rule the stamping drowned the music. The front door being
open she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) could see straight through the house into the garden at the
back as far as the shades of night would allow; and nobody appearing
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) knock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) traversed the dwelling and went up the path to the
outhouse whence the sound had attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>).

<p/>It was a windowless erection used for storage, and from the open door
there floated into the obscurity a mist of yellow radiance, which at
first Tess thought to be illuminated smoke. But on drawing nearer
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) perceived that it was a cloud of dust, lit by candles within the
outhouse, whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of
the doorway into the wide night of the garden.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came close and looked in she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) beheld indistinct forms
racing up and down to the figure of the dance, the silence of their
footfalls arising from their being overshoe in <div class="bookquote">``scroff'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--that is
to say, the powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other
products, the stirring of which by their turbulent feet created the
nebulosity that involved the scene. Through this floating, fusty
_debris_ of peat and hay, mixed with the perspirations and warmth of
the dancers, and forming together a sort of vegeto-human pollen, the
muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes, in marked contrast to the
spirit with which the measure was trodden out. They coughed as
they danced, and laughed as they coughed. Of the rushing couples
there could barely be discerned more than the high lights--the
indistinctness shaping them to satyrs clasping nymphs--a multiplicity
of Pans whirling a multiplicity of Syrinxes; Lotis attempting to
elude Priapus, and always failing.

<p/>At intervals a couple would approach the doorway for air, and
the haze no longer veiling their features, the demigods resolved
themselves into the homely personalities of her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) own next-door
neighbours. Could Trantridge in two or three short hours have
metamorphosed itself thus madly!

<p/>Some Sileni of the throng sat on benches and hay-trusses by the wall;
and one of them recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The maids don't think it respectable to dance at The Flower-de-Luce,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``They don't like to let everybody see which be their
fancy-men. Besides, the house sometimes shuts up just when their
jints begin to get greased. So we come here and send out for
liquor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when be any of you going home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>asked Tess with some anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now--a`most directly. This is all but the last jig.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) waited. The reel drew to a close, and some of the party were in
the mind of starting. But others would not, and another dance was
formed. This surely would end it, thought Tess. But it merged in
yet another. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) became restless and uneasy; yet, having waited so
long, it was necessary to wait longer; on account of the fair the
roads were dotted with roving characters of possibly ill intent; and,
though not fearful of measurable dangers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feared the unknown.
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) been near Marlott she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have had less dread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ye be nervous, my dear good soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>expostulated, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
coughs, a young man with a wet face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) straw hat so far back
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head that the brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint.
<div class="bookquote">``What's yer hurry? To-morrow is Sunday, thank God, and we can sleep
it off in church-time. Now, have a turn with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not abhor dancing, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was not going to dance here. The
movement grew more passionate: the fiddlers behind the luminous
pillar of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong
side of the bridge or with the back of the bow. But it did not
matter; the panting shapes spun onwards.

<p/>They did not vary their partners if their inclination were to stick
to previous ones. Changing partners simply meant that a satisfactory
choice had not as yet been arrived at by one or other of the pair,
and by this time every couple had been suitably matched. It was then
that the ecstasy and the dream began, in which emotion was the matter
of the universe, and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to
hinder you from spinning where you wanted to spin.

<p/>Suddenly there was a dull thump on the ground: a couple had fallen,
and lay in a mixed heap. The next couple, unable to check its
progress, came toppling over the obstacle. An inner cloud of dust
rose around the prostrate figures amid the general one of the room,
in which a twitching entanglement of arms and legs was discernible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall catch it for this, my gentleman, when you get home!''  (<font color='red'><b>the partner</b></font>)</div>burst
in female accents from the human heap--those of the unhappy partner
of the man whose clumsiness had caused the mishap; she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) happened
also to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recently married wife, in which assortment there was
nothing unusual at Trantridge as long as any affection remained
between wedded couples; and, indeed, it was not uncustomary in their
later lives, to avoid making odd lots of the single people between
whom there might be a warm understanding.

<p/>A loud laugh from behind Tess's back, in the shade of the garden,
united with the titter within the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked round, and saw
the red coal of a cigar: Alec d``Urberville was standing there alone.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) beckoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) reluctantly retreated towards him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my Beauty, what are you doing here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was so tired after her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) long day and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walk that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) confided
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>)--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been waiting ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
to have their company home, because the road at night was strange to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But it seems they will never leave off, and I really think I
will wait no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly do not. I have only a saddle-horse here to-day; but come
to The Flower-de-Luce, and I'll hire a trap, and drive you home with
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess, though flattered, had never quite got over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) original
mistrust of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>), and, despite their tardiness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) preferred to walk
home with the work-folk. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was much obliged
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>), but would not trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have said that I will wait for
'em, and they will expect me to now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Miss Independence. Please yourself... Then I shall not
hurry... My good Lord, what a kick-up they are having there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) had not put himself forward into the light, but some of them
had perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) presence led to a slight pause and a
consideration of how the time was flying. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) had re-lit
a cigar and walked away the Trantridge people began to collect
themselves from amid those who had come in from other farms, and
prepared to leave in a body. Their bundles and baskets were gathered
up, and half an hour later, when the clock-chime sounded a quarter
past eleven, they were straggling along the lane which led up the
hill towards their homes.

<p/>It was a three-mile walk, along a dry white road, made whiter
to-night by the light of the moon.

<p/>Tess soon perceived as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walked in the flock, sometimes with this
one, sometimes with that, that the fresh night air was producing
staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too
freely; some of the more careless women also were wandering in their
gait--to wit, a dark virago, Car Darch, dubbed Queen of Spades, till
lately a favourite of d``Urberville's; Nancy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) sister, nicknamed
the Queen of Diamonds; and the young married woman who had already
tumbled down. Yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance
just now to the mean unglamoured eye, to themselves the case was
different. They followed the road with a sensation that they were
soaring along in a supporting medium, possessed of original and
profound thoughts, themselves and surrounding nature forming
an organism of which all the parts harmoniously and joyously
interpenetrated each other. They were as sublime as the moon and
stars above them, and the moon and stars were as ardent as they.

<p/>Tess, however, had undergone such painful experiences of this kind in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's house that the discovery of their condition spoilt the
pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was beginning to feel in the moonlight journey. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
stuck to the party, for reasons above given.

<p/>In the open highway they had progressed in scattered order; but now
their route was through a field-gate, and the foremost finding a
difficulty in opening it, they closed up together.

<p/>This leading pedestrian was Car the Queen of Spades, who carried a
wicker-basket containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) mother's groceries, her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) own draperies,
and other purchases for the week. The basket being large and heavy,
Car had placed it for convenience of porterage on the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
head, where it rode on in jeopardized balance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) walked with
arms akimbo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--whatever is that a-creeping down thy back, Car Darch?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
one of the group suddenly.

<p/>All looked at Car. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) gown was a light cotton print, and from the
back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head a kind of rope could be seen descending to some
distance below her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) waist, like a Chinaman's queue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hair falling down,''  (<font color='red'><b>a Chinaman</b></font>)</div>said another.

<p/>No; it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hair: it was a black stream of something oozing
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) basket, and it glistened like a slimy snake in the cold
still rays of the moon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis treacle,''  (<font color='red'><b>an matron</b></font>)</div>said an observant matron.

<p/>Treacle it was. Car's poor old grandmother had a weakness for the
sweet stuff. Honey she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) had in plenty out of her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) own hives, but
treacle was what her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) soul desired, and Car had been about to give her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>)
a treat of surprise. Hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found
that the vessel containing the syrup had been smashed within.

<p/>By this time there had arisen a shout of laughter at the
extraordinary appearance of Car's back, which irritated the dark
queen into getting rid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means
available, and independently of the help of the scoffers. She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) rushed
excitedly into the field they were about to cross, and flinging
herself flat on her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) back upon the grass, began to wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) gown
as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) could by spinning horizontally on the herbage and
dragging herself over it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) elbows.

<p/>The laughter rang louder; they clung to the gate, to the posts,
rested on their staves, in the weakness engendered by their
convulsions at the spectacle of Car. Our heroine, who had hitherto
held her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) peace, at this wild moment could not help joining in with
the rest.

<p/>It was a misfortune--in more ways than one. No sooner did the dark
queen hear the soberer richer note of Tess among those of the other
work-people than a long-smouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) to
madness. She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) feet and closely faced the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>)
dislike.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How darest th' laugh at me, hussy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't really help it when t`others did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>apologized Tess,
still tittering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, th`st think th' beest everybody, dostn't, because th' beest
first favourite with He (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>) just now! But stop a bit, my lady, stop a
bit! I'm as good as two of such! Look here--here's at `ee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>To Tess's horror the dark queen began stripping off the bodice of
her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) gown--which for the added reason of its ridiculed condition she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>)
was only too glad to be free of--till she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) had bared her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) plump neck,
shoulders, and arms to the moonshine, under which they looked as
luminous and beautiful as some Praxitelean creation, in their
possession of the faultless rotundities of a lusty country-girl.
She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) fists and squared up at Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, then, I shall not fight!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the latter majestically; <div class="bookquote">``and
if I had know you was of that sort, I wouldn't have so let myself
down as to come with such a whorage as this is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of
vituperation from other quarters upon fair Tess's unlucky head,
particularly from the Queen of Diamonds, who having stood in the
relations to d``Urberville that Car had also been suspected of, united
with the latter against the common enemy. Several other women also
chimed in, with an animus which none of them would have been so
fatuous as to show but for the rollicking evening they had passed.
Thereupon, finding Tess unfairly browbeaten, the husbands and lovers
tried to make peace by defending her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); but the result of that attempt
was directly to increase the war.

<p/>Tess was indignant and ashamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) no longer minded the loneliness
of the way and the lateness of the hour; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) one object was to get
away from the whole crew as soon as possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew well enough
that the better among them would repent of their passion next day.
They were all now inside the field, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was edging back to rush
off alone when a horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of
the hedge that screened the road, and Alec d``Urberville looked round
upon them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the devil is all this row about, work-folk?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) asked.

<p/>The explanation was not readily forthcoming; and, in truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) did
not require any. Having heard their voices while yet some way off he (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>)
had ridden creepingly forward, and learnt enough to satisfy himself.

<p/>Tess was standing apart from the rest, near the gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) bent over
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Jump up behind me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``and we'll get shot
of the screaming cats in a jiffy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt almost ready to faint, so vivid was her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sense of the crisis.
At almost any other moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have refused such
proffered aid and company, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had refused them several times
before; and now the loneliness would not of itself have forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
to do otherwise. But coming as the invitation did at the particular
juncture when fear and indignation at these adversaries could be
transformed by a spring of the foot into a triumph over them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
abandoned herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) impulse, climbed the gate, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) toe upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) instep, and scrambled into the saddle behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). The pair were
speeding away into the distant gray by the time that the contentious
revellers became aware of what had happened.

<p/>The Queen of Spades forgot the stain on her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) bodice, and stood
beside the Queen of Diamonds and the new-married, staggering young
woman--all with a gaze of fixity in the direction in which the
horse's tramp was diminishing into silence on the road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What be ye looking at?''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>asked a man who had not observed the
incident.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho-ho-ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>laughed dark Car.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hee-hee-hee!''  (<font color='red'><b>the bride</b></font>)</div>laughed the tippling bride, as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) steadied herself on
the arm of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) fond husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heu-heu-heu!''  (<font color='red'><b>Car mother</b></font>)</div>laughed dark Car's mother, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) moustache as
she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) explained laconically: <div class="bookquote">``Out of the frying-pan into the fire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then these children of the open air, whom even excess of alcohol
could scarce injure permanently, betook themselves to the field-path;
and as they went there moved onward with them, around the shadow of
each one's head, a circle of opalized light, formed by the moon's
rays upon the glistening sheet of dew. Each pedestrian could see
no halo but his (<font color='blue'><b>pedestrian</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) own, which never deserted the head-shadow,
whatever its vulgar unsteadiness might be; but adhered to it, and
persistently beautified it; till the erratic motions seemed an
inherent part of the irradiation, and the fumes of their breathing
a component of the night's mist; and the spirit of the scene, and
of the moonlight, and of Nature, seemed harmoniously to mingle with
the spirit of wine.



<p/>XI


<p/>The twain cantered along for some time without speech, Tess as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>pedestrian</b></font>) still panting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) triumph, yet in other respects
dubious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had perceived that the horse was not the spirited one
he (<font color='blue'><b>pedestrian</b></font>) sometimes rose, and felt no alarm on that score, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seat
was precarious enough despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tight hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>pedestrian</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>pedestrian</b></font>)
to slow the animal to a walk, which Alec accordingly did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neatly done, was it not, dear Tess?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) said by and by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I ought to be much obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess, why do you always dislike my kissing you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose--because I don't love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am angry with you sometimes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I half feared as much.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alec</b></font>)</div>Nevertheless, Alec did not object to
that confession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) knew that anything was better then frigidity.
<div class="bookquote">``Why haven't you told me when I have made you angry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know very well why. Because I cannot help myself here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't offended you often by love-making?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many times?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know as well as I--too many times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every time I have tried?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was silent, and the horse ambled along for a considerable
distance, till a faint luminous fog, which had hung in the hollows
all the evening, became general and enveloped them. It seemed to
hold the moonlight in suspension, rendering it more pervasive than in
clear air. Whether on this account, or from absent-mindedness, or
from sleepiness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not perceive that they had long ago passed
the point at which the lane to Trantridge branched from the highway,
and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) conductor had not taken the Trantridge track.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was inexpressibly weary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had risen at five o'clock every
morning of that week, had been on foot the whole of each day, and on
this evening had in addition walked the three miles to Chaseborough,
waited three hours for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) neighbours without eating or drinking,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) impatience to start them preventing either; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had then walked
a mile of the way home, and had undergone the excitement of the
quarrel, till, with the slow progress of their steed, it was now
nearly one o'clock. Only once, however, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) overcome by actual
drowsiness. In that moment of oblivion her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head sank gently against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>D``Urberville stopped the horse, withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feet from the stirrups,
turned sideways on the saddle, and enclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) waist with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arm to
support her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).

<p/>This immediately put her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) on the defensive, and with one of those
sudden impulses of reprisal to which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was liable she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a
little push from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). In his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ticklish position he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nearly lost his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
balance and only just avoided rolling over into the road, the horse,
though a powerful one, being fortunately the quietest he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rode.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is devilish unkind!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I mean no harm--only to keep
you from falling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pondered suspiciously, till, thinking that this might after all
be true, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) relented, and said quite humbly, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't pardon you unless you show some confidence in me. Good
God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) burst out, <div class="bookquote">``what am I, to be repulsed so by a mere chit like
you? For near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings,
eluded me, and snubbed me; and I won't stand it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you to-morrow, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you will not leave me to-morrow! Will you, I ask once more,
show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm? Come,
between us two and nobody else, now. We know each other well; and
you know that I love you, and think you the prettiest girl in the
world, which you are. Mayn't I treat you as a lover?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) drew a quick pettish breath of objection, writhing uneasily on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seat, looked far ahead, and murmured, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I wish--how
can I say yes or no when--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) settled the matter by clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) desired,
and Tess expressed no further negative. Thus they sidled
slowly onward till it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) they had been advancing for an
unconscionable time--far longer than was usually occupied by the
short journey from Chaseborough, even at this walking pace, and
that they were no longer on hard road, but in a mere trackway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, where be we?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Passing by a wood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A wood--what wood? Surely we are quite out of the road?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A bit of The Chase--the oldest wood in England. It is a lovely
night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could you be so treacherous!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, between archness and
real dismay, and getting rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arm by pulling open his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fingers
one by one, though at the risk of slipping off herself. <div class="bookquote">``Just when
I've been putting such trust in you, and obliging you to please you,
because I thought I had wronged you by that push! Please set me
down, and let me walk home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot walk home, darling, even if the air were clear. We are
miles away from Trantridge, if I must tell you, and in this growing
fog you might wander for hours among these trees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) coaxed. <div class="bookquote">``Put me down, I beg you. I don't
mind where it is; only let me get down, sir, please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, I will--on one condition. Having brought you
here to this out-of-the-way place, I feel myself responsible for
your safe-conduct home, whatever you may yourself feel about it.
As to your getting to Trantridge without assistance, it is quite
impossible; for, to tell the truth, dear, owing to this fog, which so
disguises everything, I don't quite know where we are myself. Now,
if you will promise to wait beside the horse while I walk through the
bushes till I come to some road or house, and ascertain exactly our
whereabouts, I'll deposit you here willingly. When I come back I'll
give you full directions, and if you insist upon walking you may; or
you may ride--at your pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had stolen a cursory kiss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sprang down on the other side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I must hold the horse?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; it's not necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alec</b></font>)</div>replied Alec, patting the panting
creature. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s had enough of it for to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) turned the horse's head into the bushes, hitched him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) on to a
bough, and made a sort of couch or nest for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in the deep mass of
dead leaves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you sit there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The leaves have not got damp as yet.
Just give an eye to the horse--it will be quite sufficient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) took a few steps away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), but, returning, said, <div class="bookquote">``By the bye,
Tess, your father has a new cob to-day. Somebody gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Somebody? You!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>D``Urberville nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O how very good of you that is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) exclaimed, with a painful sense
of the awkwardness of having to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) just then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the children have some toys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know--you ever sent them anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured, much
moved. <div class="bookquote">``I almost wish you had not--yes, I almost wish it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It--hampers me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tessy--don't you love me ever so little now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm grateful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reluctantly admitted. <div class="bookquote">``But I fear I do not--''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The sudden vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) passion for herself as a factor in this
result so distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that, beginning with one slow tear, and
then following with another, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wept outright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down here, and wait till I
come.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) passively sat down amid the leaves he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) had heaped, and
shivered slightly. <div class="bookquote">``Are you cold?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very--a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) fingers, which sank into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as into down.
<div class="bookquote">``You have only that puffy muslin dress on--how's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It's my best summer one. <div class="bookquote">``Twas very warm when I started, and I
didn't know I was going to ride, and that it would be night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nights grow chilly in September. Let me see.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) pulled off a
light overcoat that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) had worn, and put it round her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tenderly.
<div class="bookquote">``That's it--now you'll feel warmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``Now, my pretty,
rest there; I shall soon be back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Having buttoned the overcoat round her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shoulders he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) plunged into the
webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could hear the rustling of the branches as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) ascended the
adjoining slope, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) movements were no louder than the hopping
of a bird, and finally died away. With the setting of the moon the
pale light lessened, and Tess became invisible as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fell into
reverie upon the leaves where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>In the meantime Alec d``Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>)
had, in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any
turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>),
and giving far more attention to Tess's moonlit person than to any
wayside object. A little rest for the jaded animal being desirable,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) did not hasten his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) search for landmarks. A clamber over the
hill into the adjoining vale brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) to the fence of a highway
whose contours he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) recognized, which settled the question of their
whereabouts. D``Urberville thereupon turned back; but by this time
the moon had quite gone down, and partly on account of the fog The
Chase was wrapped in thick darkness, although morning was not far
off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to avoid
contact with the boughs, and discovered that to hit the exact spot
from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) had started was at first entirely beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>). Roaming
up and down, round and round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) at length heard a slight movement of
the horse close at hand; and the sleeve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) overcoat unexpectedly
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said d``Urberville.

<p/>There was no answer. The obscurity was now so great that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) could
see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) feet, which
represented the white muslin figure he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) had left upon the dead leaves.
Everything else was blackness alike. D``Urberville stooped; and heard
a gentle regular breathing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) knelt and bent lower, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) breath
warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) face, and in a moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) cheek was in contact with hers.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was sleeping soundly, and upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyelashes there lingered
tears.

<p/>Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. Above them rose the
primeval yews and oaks of The Chase, in which there poised gentle
roosting birds in their last nap; and about them stole the hopping
rabbits and hares. But, might some say, where was Tess's guardian
angel? where was the providence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) simple faith? Perhaps, like
that other god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was talking,
or he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was pursuing, or he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was in a journey, or he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was sleeping and
not to be awaked.

<p/>Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as
gossamer, and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have
been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; why
so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the
woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical
philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order. One may,
indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present
catastrophe. Doubtless some of Tess d``Urberville's mailed ancestors
rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more
ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time. But though to visit
the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good
enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human nature; and it
therefore does not mend the matter.

<p/>As Tess's own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying
among each other in their fatalistic way: <div class="bookquote">``It was to be.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess people</b></font>)</div>There
lay the pity of it. An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our
heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers
who stepped from her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) mother's door to try her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) fortune at Trantridge
poultry-farm.


<p/>END OF PHASE THE FIRST





<p/>Phase the Second: Maiden No More



<p/>XII


<p/>The basket was heavy and the bundle was large, but she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) lugged them
along like a person who did not find her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) especial burden in material
things. Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) stopped to rest in a mechanical way by some
gate or post; and then, giving the baggage another hitch upon her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
full round arm, went steadily on again.

<p/>It was a Sunday morning in late October, about four months after Tess
Durbeyfield's arrival at Trantridge, and some few weeks subsequent to
the night ride in The Chase. The time was not long past daybreak,
and the yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) back lighted
the ridge towards which her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) face was set--the barrier of the vale
wherein she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had of late been a stranger--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) would have to
climb over to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) birthplace. The ascent was gradual on this
side, and the soil and scenery differed much from those within
Blakemore Vale. Even the character and accent of the two peoples
had shades of difference, despite the amalgamating effects of a
roundabout railway; so that, though less than twenty miles from the
place of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) sojourn at Trantridge, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) native village had seemed a
far-away spot. The field-folk shut in there traded northward and
westward, travelled, courted, and married northward and westward,
thought northward and westward; those on this side mainly directed
their energies and attention to the east and south.

<p/>The incline was the same down which d``Urberville had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) so
wildly on that day in June. Tess went up the remainder of its length
without stopping, and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed
over the familiar green world beyond, now half-veiled in mist. It
was always beautiful from here; it was terribly beautiful to Tess
to-day, for since her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes last fell upon it she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had learnt that the
serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) views of life had
been totally changed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) by the lesson. Verily another girl than
the simple one she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been at home was she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) who, bowed by thought,
stood still here, and turned to look behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not bear
to look forward into the Vale.

<p/>Ascending by the long white road that Tess herself had just laboured
up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw a two-wheeled vehicle, beside which walked a man, who
held up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to attract her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) attention.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) obeyed the signal to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with unspeculative repose, and
in a few minutes man and horse stopped beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you slip away by stealth like this?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said d``Urberville, with
upbraiding breathlessness; <div class="bookquote">``on a Sunday morning, too, when people
were all in bed! I only discovered it by accident, and I have been
driving like the deuce to overtake you. Just look at the mare. Why
go off like this? You know that nobody wished to hinder your going.
And how unnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot, and
encumber yourself with this heavy load! I have followed like a
madman, simply to drive you the rest of the distance, if you won't
come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you wouldn't--I said so! Well, then, put up your basket,
and let me help you on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) listlessly placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) basket and bundle within the dog-cart, and
stepped up, and they sat side by side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had no fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) now,
and in the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) confidence her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) sorrow lay.

<p/>D``Urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and the journey was continued
with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by
the wayside. He (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) had quite forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) struggle to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) when,
in the early summer, they had driven in the opposite direction along
the same road. But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had not, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat now, like a puppet,
replying to his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) remarks in monosyllables. After some miles they came
in view of the clump of trees beyond which the village of Marlott
stood. It was only then that her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) still face showed the least
emotion, a tear or two beginning to trickle down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you crying for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) coldly asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only thinking that I was born over there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>murmured Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--we must all be born somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had never been born--there or anywhere else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! Well, if you didn't wish to come to Trantridge why did you
come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't come for love of me, that I'll swear.''

sincerely loved you, if I loved you still, I should not so loathe and
hate myself for my weakness as I do now! ... My eyes were dazed by
you for a little, and that was all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) shoulders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) resumed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't understand your meaning till it was too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what every woman says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you dare to use such words!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried, turning impetuously
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes flashing as the latent spirit -LRB-of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was to
see more some day-RRB- awoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My God! I could knock you out of
the gig! Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says
some women may feel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) said, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to wound you. I did
wrong--I admit it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) dropped into some little bitterness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
continued: <div class="bookquote">``Only you needn't be so everlastingly flinging it in my
face. I am ready to pay to the uttermost farthing. You know you
need not work in the fields or the dairies again. You know you may
clothe yourself with the best, instead of in the bald plain way you
have lately affected, as if you couldn't get a ribbon more than you
earn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lip lifted slightly, though there was little scorn, as a rule,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) large and impulsive nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said I will not take anything more from you, and I will
not--I cannot! I SHOULD be your creature to go on doing that, and
I won't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``One would think you were a princess from your manner, in addition
to a true and original d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville--ha! ha! Well, Tess, dear, I
can say no more. I suppose I am a bad fellow--a damn bad fellow.
I was born bad, and I have lived bad, and I shall die bad in all
probability. But, upon my lost soul, I won't be bad towards you
again, Tess. And if certain circumstances should arise--you
understand--in which you are in the least need, the least difficulty,
send me one line, and you shall have by return whatever you require.
I may not be at Trantridge--I am going to London for a time--I can't
stand the old woman. But all letters will be forwarded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) further, and they
stopped just under the clump of trees. D``Urberville alighted, and
lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) down bodily in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) arms, afterwards placing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) articles
on the ground beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) slightly, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye just
lingering in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned to take the parcels for
departure.

<p/>Alec d``Urberville removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) cigar, bent towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not going to turn away like that, dear! Come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alec</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered indifferently. <div class="bookquote">``See how you've mastered
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thereupon turned round and lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face to his (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), and remained
like a marble term while he (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) imprinted a kiss upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek--half
perfunctorily, half as if zest had not yet quite died out. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes
vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was
given, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) were nearly unconscious of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now the other side, for old acquaintance' sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head in the same passive way, as one might turn at the
request of a sketcher or hairdresser, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) kissed the other side,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) lips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the
skin of the mushrooms in the fields around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't give me your mouth and kiss me back. You never willingly
do that--you'll never love me, I fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said so, often. It is true. I have never really and truly
loved you, and I think I never can.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>hairdresser</b></font>) added mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,
of all things, a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now;
but I have honour enough left, little as `tis, not to tell that lie.
If I did love you, I may have the best o' causes for letting you know
it. But I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) emitted a laboured breath, as if the scene were getting rather
oppressive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) heart, or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) conscience, or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) gentility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are absurdly melancholy, Tess. I have no
reason for flattering you now, and I can say plainly
that you need not be so sad. You can hold your own for
beauty against any woman of these parts, gentle or
simple; I say it to you as a practical man and
well-wisher. If you are wise you will show it to the
world more than you do before it fades... And yet,
Tess, will you come back to me! Upon my soul, I don't
like to let you go like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, never! I made up my mind as soon as I saw--what I ought to
have seen sooner; and I won't come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then good morning, my four months' cousin--good-bye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) leapt up lightly, arranged the reins, and was gone between the
tall red-berried hedges.

<p/>Tess did not look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), but slowly wound along the crooked lane.
It was still early, and though the sun's lower limb was just free of
the hill, his (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) rays, ungenial and peering, addressed the eye rather
than the touch as yet. There was not a human soul near. Sad October
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that
lane.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walked, however, some footsteps approached behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), the
footsteps of a man; and owing to the briskness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advance he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
close at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heels and had said <div class="bookquote">``Good morning''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been
long aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) propinquity. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to be an artisan of some
sort, and carried a tin pot of red paint in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked
in a business-like manner if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should take her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) basket, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do, walking beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is early to be astir this Sabbath morn!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When most people are at rest from their week's work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) also assented to this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though I do more real work to-day than all the week besides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the week I work for the glory of man, and on Sunday for the
glory of God. That's more real than the other--hey? I have a little
to do here at this stile.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man turned, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, to an
opening at the roadside leading into a pasture. <div class="bookquote">``If you'll wait a
moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I shall not be long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) basket she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not well do otherwise; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) waited,
observing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set down her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) basket and the tin pot, and stirring
the paint with the brush that was in it began painting large square
letters on the middle board of the three composing the stile, placing
a comma after each word, as if to give pause while that word was
driven well home to the reader's heart--


<p/>THY, DAMNATION, SLUMBERETH, NOT.
2 Pet. ii. 3.


<p/>Against the peaceful landscape, the pale, decaying tints of the
copses, the blue air of the horizon, and the lichened stile-boards,
these staring vermilion words shone forth. They seemed to shout
themselves out and make the atmosphere ring. Some people might have
cried <div class="bookquote">``Alas, poor Theology!''  (<font color='red'><b>Some people</b></font>)</div>at the hideous defacement--the last
grotesque phase of a creed which had served mankind well in its time.
But the words entered Tess with accusatory horror. It was as if this
man had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) recent history; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a total stranger.

<p/>Having finished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) text he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) basket, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
mechanically resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walk beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe what you paint?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked in low tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe that tex? Do I believe in my own existence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tremulously, <div class="bookquote">``suppose your sin was not of your own
seeking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot split hairs on that burning query,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have
walked hundreds of miles this past summer, painting these texes on
every wall, gate, and stile the length and breadth of this district.
I leave their application to the hearts of the people who read 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they are horrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess. <div class="bookquote">``Crushing! Killing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what they are meant to be!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied in a trade voice.
<div class="bookquote">``But you should read my hottest ones--them I kips for slums and
seaports. They'd make ye wriggle! Not but what this is a very good
tex for rural districts. ... Ah--there's a nice bit of blank wall up
by that barn standing to waste. I must put one there--one that it
will be good for dangerous young females like yerself to heed. Will
ye wait, missy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) basket Tess trudged on. A little way
forward she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head. The old gray wall began to advertise
a similar fiery lettering to the first, with a strange and unwonted
mien, as if distressed at duties it had never before been called upon
to perform. It was with a sudden flush that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) read and realized
what was to be the inscription he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now halfway through--


<p/>THOU, SHALT, NOT, COMMIT--


<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheerful friend saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looking, stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brush, and shouted--

<p/>``If you want to ask for edification on these things of moment,
there's a very earnest good man going to preach a charity-sermon
to-day in the parish you are going to--Mr Clare of Emminster. I'm
not of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) persuasion now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'s a good man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'ll expound as
well as any parson I know. <div class="bookquote">``Twas he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) began the work in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>But Tess did not answer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) throbbingly resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walk, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes
fixed on the ground. <div class="bookquote">``Pooh--I don't believe God said such things!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured contemptuously when her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) flush had died away.

<p/>A plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's chimney, the
sight of which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart ache. The aspect of the interior, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reached it, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart ache more. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother, who had just
come down stairs, turned to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from the fireplace, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
was kindling barked-oak twigs under the breakfast kettle. The young
children were still above, as was also her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father, it being Sunday
morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt justified in lying an additional half-hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!--my dear Tess!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>exclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) surprised mother, jumping up and
kissing the girl. <div class="bookquote">``How be ye? I didn't see you till you was in upon
me! Have you come home to be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have not come for that, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then for a holiday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--for a holiday; for a long holiday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, isn't your cousin going to do the handsome thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s not my cousin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s not going to marry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother eyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) narrowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, you have not told me all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/>Then Tess went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face upon Joan's neck, and
told.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet th`st not got him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to marry `ee!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>reiterated her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Any
woman would have done it but you, after that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps any woman would except me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been something like a story to come back with, if
you had!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Durbeyfield, ready to burst into tears of
vexation. <div class="bookquote">``After all the talk about you and him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) which has reached
us here, who would have expected it to end like this! Why didn't ye
think of doing some good for your family instead o' thinking only of
yourself? See how I've got to teave and slave, and your poor weak
father with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart clogged like a dripping-pan. I did hope for
something to come out o' this! To see what a pretty pair you and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
made that day when you drove away together four months ago! See what
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has given us--all, as we thought, because we were his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kin. But if
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s not, it must have been done because of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) love for `ee. And
yet you've not got him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to marry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alec</b></font>)</div><p/>Get Alec d``Urberville in the mind to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marry HER! On
matrimony he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never once said a word. And what if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had? How a
convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to
answer him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not say. But her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) poor foolish mother little
knew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) present feeling towards this man. Perhaps it was unusual
in the circumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but there it was; and
this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had said, was what made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) detest herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
never wholly cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not at all care for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had dreaded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), winced before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), succumbed to adroit advantages
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) helplessness; then, temporarily blinded by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ardent
manners, had been stirred to confused surrender awhile: had suddenly
despised and disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and had run away. That was all. Hate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not quite; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dust and ashes to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and even for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
name's sake she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) scarcely wished to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have been more careful if you didn't mean to get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
make you his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O mother, my mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the agonized girl, turning passionately
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parent as if her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) poor heart would break. <div class="bookquote">``How could I be
expected to know? I was a child when I left this house four months
ago. Why didn't you tell me there was danger in men-folk? Why
didn't you warn me? Ladies know what to fend hands against, because

chance o' learning in that way, and you did not help me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother was subdued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought if I spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fond feelings and what they might lead
to, you would be hontish wi' him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and lose your chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) murmured,
wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) apron. ``Well, we must make the best of it,
I suppose. <div class="bookquote">``Tis nater, after all, and what do please God!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>XIII


<p/>The event of Tess Durbeyfield's return from the manor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) bogus
kinsfolk was rumoured abroad, if rumour be not too large a word for
a space of a square mile. In the afternoon several young girls of
Marlott, former schoolfellows and acquaintances of Tess, called to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed, as
became visitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest -LRB-as
they supposed-RRB-, and sat round the room looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with great
curiosity. For the fact that it was this said thirty-first cousin,
Mr d``Urberville, who had fallen in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), a gentleman
not altogether local, whose reputation as a reckless gallant and
heartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries
of Trantridge, lent Tess's supposed position, by its fearsomeness, a
far higher fascination that it would have exercised if unhazardous.

<p/>Their interest was so deep that the younger ones whispered when her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
back was turned--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) is; and how that best frock do set her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) off! I
believe it cost an immense deal, and that it was a gift from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ones</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess, who was reaching up to get the tea-things from the
corner-cupboard, did not hear these commentaries. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had heard
them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might soon have set her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) friends right on the matter. But
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother heard, and Joan's simple vanity, having been denied the
hope of a dashing marriage, fed itself as well as it could upon
the sensation of a dashing flirtation. Upon the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt
gratified, even though such a limited and evanescent triumph should
involve her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) daughter's reputation; it might end in marriage yet, and
in the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) responsiveness to their admiration she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) invited
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) visitors to stay to tea.

<p/>Their chatter, their laughter, their good-humoured innuendoes, above
all, their flashes and flickerings of envy, revived Tess's spirits
also; and, as the evening wore on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) caught the infection of their
excitement, and grew almost gay. The marble hardness left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) moved with something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) old bounding step, and flushed in all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) young beauty.

<p/>At moments, in spite of thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would reply to their inquiries
with a manner of superiority, as if recognizing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) experiences
in the field of courtship had, indeed, been slightly enviable. But
so far was she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from being, in the words of Robert South, <div class="bookquote">``in love
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own ruin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert</b></font>)</div>that the illusion was transient as lightning;
cold reason came back to mock her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) spasmodic weakness; the ghastliness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) momentary pride would convict her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to reserved
listlessness again.

<p/>And the despondency of the next morning's dawn, when it was no longer
Sunday, but Monday; and no best clothes; and the laughing visitors
were gone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) awoke alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) old bed, the innocent younger
children breathing softly around her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). In place of the excitement of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) return, and the interest it had inspired, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) a
long and stony highway which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had to tread, without aid, and with
little sympathy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) depression was then terrible, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
have hidden herself in a tomb.

<p/>In the course of a few weeks Tess revived sufficiently to show
herself so far as was necessary to get to church one Sunday morning.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) liked to hear the chanting--such as it was--and the old Psalms,
and to join in the Morning Hymn. That innate love of melody, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had inherited from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ballad-singing mother, gave the simplest
music a power over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) which could well-nigh drag her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bosom at times.

<p/>To be as much out of observation as possible for reasons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own,
and to escape the gallantries of the young men, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) set out before
the chiming began, and took a back seat under the gallery, close to
the lumber, where only old men and women came, and where the bier
stood on end among the churchyard tools.

<p/>Parishioners dropped in by twos and threes, deposited themselves
in rows before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), rested three-quarters of a minute on their
foreheads as if they were praying, though they were not; then sat up,
and looked around. When the chants came on, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) favourites
happened to be chosen among the rest--the old double chant
<div class="bookquote">``Langdon'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not know what it was called, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would
much have liked to know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought, without exactly wording the
thought, how strange and god-like was a composer's power, who from
the grave could lead through sequences of emotion, which he (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) alone had
felt at first, a girl like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who had never heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) name, and
never would have a clue to his (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) personality.

<p/>The people who had turned their heads turned them again as the
service proceeded; and at last observing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), they whispered to each
other. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew what their whispers were about, grew sick at heart,
and felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could come to church no more.

<p/>The bedroom which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shared with some of the children formed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
retreat more continually than ever. Here, under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) few square yards
of thatch, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watched winds, and snows, and rains, gorgeous sunsets,
and successive moons at their full. So close kept she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that at length
almost everybody thought she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had gone away.

<p/>The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it
was then, when out in the woods, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seemed least solitary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
knew how to hit to a hair's-breadth that moment of evening when the
light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of
day and the suspense of night neutralize each other, leaving absolute
mental liberty. It is then that the plight of being alive becomes
attenuated to its least possible dimensions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had no fear of the
shadows; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sole idea seemed to be to shun mankind--or rather that
cold accretion called the world, which, so terrible in the mass, is
so unformidable, even pitiable, in its units.

<p/>On these lonely hills and dales her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) quiescent glide was of a piece
with the element she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) moved in. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) flexuous and stealthy figure
became an integral part of the scene. At times her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) whimsical fancy
would intensify natural processes around her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) till they seemed a part
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own story. Rather they became a part of it; for the world is
only a psychological phenomenon, and what they seemed they were. The
midnight airs and gusts, moaning amongst the tightly-wrapped buds and
bark of the winter twigs, were formulae of bitter reproach. A wet
day was the expression of irremediable grief at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) weakness in the
mind of some vague ethical being whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not class definitely
as the God of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) childhood, and could not comprehend as any other.

<p/>But this encompassment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own characterization, based on shreds
of convention, peopled by phantoms and voices antipathetic to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),
was a sorry and mistaken creation of Tess's fancy--a cloud of moral
hobgoblins by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was terrified without reason. It was they
that were out of harmony with the actual world, not she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Walking
among the sleeping birds in the hedges, watching the skipping rabbits
on a moonlit warren, or standing under a pheasant-laden bough, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
looked upon herself as a figure of Guilt intruding into the haunts
of Innocence. But all the while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was making a distinction where
there was no difference. Feeling herself in antagonism, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was
quite in accord. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been made to break an accepted social law,
but no law known to the environment in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fancied herself such
an anomaly.



<p/>XIV


<p/>It was a hazy sunrise in August. The denser nocturnal vapours,
attacked by the warm beams, were dividing and shrinking into isolated
fleeces within hollows and coverts, where they waited till they
should be dried away to nothing.

<p/>The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal
look, demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) present aspect, coupled with the lack of all human forms in the
scene, explained the old-time heliolatries in a moment. One could
feel that a saner religion had never prevailed under the sky. The
luminary was a golden-haired, beaming, mild-eyed, God-like creature,
gazing down in the vigour and intentness of youth upon an earth that
was brimming with interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) light, a little later, broke though chinks of cottage shutters,
throwing stripes like red-hot pokers upon cupboards, chests of
drawers, and other furniture within; and awakening harvesters who
were not already astir.

<p/>But of all ruddy things that morning the brightest were two broad
arms of painted wood, which rose from the margin of yellow cornfield
hard by Marlott village. They, with two others below, formed the
revolving Maltese cross of the reaping-machine, which had been
brought to the field on the previous evening to be ready for
operations this day. The paint with which they were smeared,
intensified in hue by the sunlight, imparted to them a look of
having been dipped in liquid fire.

<p/>The field had already been <div class="bookquote">``opened'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; that is to say, a lane a few
feet wide had been hand-cut through the wheat along the whole
circumference of the field for the first passage of the horses and
machine.

<p/>Two groups, one of men and lads, the other of women, had come down
the lane just at the hour when the shadows of the eastern hedge-top
struck the west hedge midway, so that the heads of the groups were
enjoying sunrise while their feet were still in the dawn. They
disappeared from the lane between the two stone posts which flanked
the nearest field-gate.

<p/>Presently there arose from within a ticking like the love-making of
the grasshopper. The machine had begun, and a moving concatenation
of three horses and the aforesaid long rickety machine was visible
over the gate, a driver sitting upon one of the hauling horses,
and an attendant on the seat of the implement. Along one side of
the field the whole wain went, the arms of the mechanical reaper
revolving slowly, till it passed down the hill quite out of sight.
In a minute it came up on the other side of the field at the same
equable pace; the glistening brass star in the forehead of the fore
horse first catching the eye as it rose into view over the stubble,
then the bright arms, and then the whole machine.

<p/>The narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with
each circuit, and the standing corn was reduced to a smaller area as
the morning wore on. Rabbits, hares, snakes, rats, mice, retreated
inwards as into a fastness, unaware of the ephemeral nature of their
refuge, and of the doom that awaited them later in the day when,
their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they
were huddled together, friends and foes, till the last few yards of
upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and
they were every one put to death by the sticks and stones of the
harvesters.

<p/>The reaping-machine left the fallen corn behind it in little heaps,
each heap being of the quantity for a sheaf; and upon these the
active binders in the rear laid their hands--mainly women, but some
of them men in print shirts, and trousers supported round their
waists by leather straps, rendering useless the two buttons behind,
which twinkled and bristled with sunbeams at every movement of each
wearer, as if they were a pair of eyes in the small of his (<font color='blue'><b>harvesters</b></font>) back.

<p/>But those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company
of binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature, and is not merely
an object set down therein as at ordinary times. A field-man is a
personality afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
somehow lost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own margin, imbibed the essence of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) surrounding,
and assimilated herself with it.

<p/>The women--or rather girls, for they were mostly young--wore drawn
cotton bonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun, and
gloves to prevent their hands being wounded by the stubble. There
was one wearing a pale pink jacket, another in a cream-coloured
tight-sleeved gown, another in a petticoat as red as the arms of the
reaping-machine; and others, older, in the brown-rough <div class="bookquote">``wropper''
 (<font color='red'><b>others dress</b></font>)</div>or over-all--the old-established and most appropriate dress of the
field-woman, which the young ones were abandoning. This morning the
eye returns involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
being the most flexuous and finely-drawn figure of them all. But
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bonnet is pulled so far over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brow that none of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face is
disclosed while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) binds, though her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) complexion may be guessed from
a stray twine or two of dark brown hair which extends below the
curtain of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bonnet. Perhaps one reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seduces casual
attention is that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never courts it, though the other women often
gaze around them.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) binding proceeds with clock-like monotony. From the sheaf last
finished she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) draws a handful of ears, patting their tips with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
left palm to bring them even. Then, stooping low, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) moves forward,
gathering the corn with both hands against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees, and pushing
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other
side, holding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
brings the ends of the bond together, and kneels on the sheaf while
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ties it, beating back her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) skirts now and then when lifted by the
breeze. A bit of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) naked arm is visible between the buff leather
of the gauntlet and the sleeve of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gown; and as the day wears on
its feminine smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds.

<p/>At intervals she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stands up to rest, and to retie her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) disarranged
apron, or to pull her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bonnet straight. Then one can see the oval
face of a handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy
clinging tresses, which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything
they fall against. The cheeks are paler, the teeth more regular,
the red lips thinner than is usual in a country-bred girl.

<p/>It is Tess Durbeyfield, otherwise d``Urberville, somewhat changed--the
same, but not the same; at the present stage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) existence living
as a stranger and an alien here, though it was no strange land that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was in. After a long seclusion she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had come to a resolve to
undertake outdoor work in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) native village, the busiest season of
the year in the agricultural world having arrived, and nothing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could do within the house being so remunerative for the time as
harvesting in the fields.

<p/>The movements of the other women were more or less similar to Tess's,
the whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille
at the completion of a sheaf by each, every one placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sheaf on
end against those of the rest, till a shock, or <div class="bookquote">``stitch''  (<font color='red'><b>dancers</b></font>)</div>as it was
here called, of ten or a dozen was formed.

<p/>They went to breakfast, and came again, and the work proceeded as
before. As the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) might
have noticed that every now and then Tess's glance flitted wistfully
to the brow of the hill, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not pause in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sheafing.
On the verge of the hour the heads of a group of children, of ages
ranging from six to fourteen, rose over the stubbly convexity of the
hill.

<p/>The face of Tess flushed slightly, but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not pause.

<p/>The eldest of the comers, a girl who wore a triangular shawl, its
corner draggling on the stubble, carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arms what at first
sight seemed to be a doll, but proved to be an infant in long
clothes. Another brought some lunch. The harvesters ceased working,
took their provisions, and sat down against one of the shocks. Here
they fell to, the men plying a stone jar freely, and passing round a
cup.

<p/>Tess Durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) labours.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) sat down at the end of the shock, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) face turned somewhat away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) companions. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had deposited herself a man in a
rabbit-skin cap, and with a red handkerchief tucked into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belt,
held the cup of ale over the top of the shock for her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) to drink. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) did not accept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offer. As soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) lunch was spread she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
called up the big girl, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) sister, and took the baby of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), who,
glad to be relieved of the burden, went away to the next shock and
joined the other children playing there. Tess, with a curiously
stealthy yet courageous movement, and with a still rising colour,
unfastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) frock and began suckling the child.

<p/>The men who sat nearest considerately turned their faces towards the
other end of the field, some of them beginning to smoke; one, with
absent-minded fondness, regretfully stroking the jar that would no
longer yield a stream. All the women but Tess fell into animated
talk, and adjusted the disarranged knots of their hair.

<p/>When the infant had taken its fill, the young mother sat it upright
in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lap, and looking into the far distance, dandled it with a
gloomy indifference that was almost dislike; then all of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
fell to violently kissing it some dozens of times, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could
never leave off, the child crying at the vehemence of an onset which
strangely combined passionateness with contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)'s fond of that there child, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mid pretend to hate en,
and say she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wishes the baby and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) too were in the churchyard,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>observed the woman in the red petticoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)'ll soon leave off saying that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the one in buff. <div class="bookquote">``Lord,
`tis wonderful what a body can get used to o' that sort in time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little more than persuading had to do wi' the coming o`t, I
reckon. There were they that heard a sobbing one night last year in
The Chase; and it mid ha' gone hard wi' a certain party if folks had
come along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, a little more, or a little less, 'twas a thousand pities that
it should have happened to she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), of all others. But `tis always the
comeliest! The plain ones be as safe as churches--hey, Jenny?''  (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div>The
speaker turned to one of the group who certainly was not ill-defined
as plain.

<p/>It was a thousand pities, indeed; it was impossible for even an enemy
to feel otherwise on looking at Tess as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sat there, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
flower-like mouth and large tender eyes, neither black nor blue nor
grey nor violet; rather all those shades together, and a hundred
others, which could be seen if one looked into their irises--shade
behind shade--tint beyond tint--around pupils that had no bottom; an
almost standard woman, but for the slight incautiousness of character
inherited from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) race.

<p/>A resolution which had surprised herself had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into the
fields this week for the first time during many months. After
wearing and wasting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) palpitating heart with every engine of regret
that lonely inexperience could devise, common sense had illuminated
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would do well to be useful again--to taste
anew sweet independence at any price. The past was past; whatever
it had been, it was no more at hand. Whatever its consequences,
time would close over them; they would all in a few years be as if
they had never been, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself grassed down and forgotten.
Meanwhile the trees were just as green as before; the birds sang and
the sun shone as clearly now as ever. The familiar surroundings had
not darkened because of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grief, nor sickened because of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pain.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have seen that what had bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head so profoundly--the
thought of the world's concern at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) situation--was founded on an
illusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a
structure of sensations, to anybody but herself. To all humankind
besides, Tess was only a passing thought. Even to friends she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was
no more than a frequently passing thought. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) made herself
miserable the livelong night and day it was only this much to
them--<div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) makes herself unhappy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tried to be cheerful,
to dismiss all care, to take pleasure in the daylight, the flowers,
the baby, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could only be this idea to them--<div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) bears it
very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Moreover, alone in a desert island would she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) have been
wretched at what had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)? Not greatly. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
have been but just created, to discover herself as a spouseless
mother, with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless
child, would the position have caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to despair? No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would
have taken it calmly, and found pleasure therein. Most of the misery
had been generated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) conventional aspect, and not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) innate
sensations.

<p/>Whatever Tess's reasoning, some spirit had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to dress
herself up neatly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had formerly done, and come out into the
fields, harvest-hands being greatly in demand just then. This was
why she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had borne herself with dignity, and had looked people calmly
in the face at times, even when holding the baby in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arms.

<p/>The harvest-men rose from the shock of corn, and stretched their
limbs, and extinguished their pipes. The horses, which had been
unharnessed and fed, were again attached to the scarlet machine.
Tess, having quickly eaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own meal, beckoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eldest
sister to come and take away the baby, fastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dress, put on
the buff gloves again, and stooped anew to draw a bond from the last
completed sheaf for the tying of the next.

<p/>In the afternoon and evening the proceedings of the morning were
continued, Tess staying on till dusk with the body of harvesters.
Then they all rode home in one of the largest wagons, in the company
of a broad tarnished moon that had risen from the ground to the
eastwards, its face resembling the outworn gold-leaf halo of some
worm-eaten Tuscan saint. Tess's female companions sang songs, and
showed themselves very sympathetic and glad at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reappearance out
of doors, though they could not refrain from mischievously throwing
in a few verses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry
green wood and came back a changed state. There are counterpoises
and compensations in life; and the event which had made of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) a
social warning had also for the moment made her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) the most interesting
personage in the village to many. Their friendliness won her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) still
farther away from herself, their lively spirits were contagious, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) became almost gay.

<p/>But now that her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) moral sorrows were passing away a fresh one arose on
the natural side of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) which knew no social law. When she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) reached
home it was to learn to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) grief that the baby had been suddenly
taken ill since the afternoon. Some such collapse had been probable,
so tender and puny was its frame; but the event came as a shock
nevertheless.

<p/>The baby's offence against society in coming into the world was
forgotten by the girl-mother; her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) soul's desire was to continue that
offence by preserving the life of the child. However, it soon grew
clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the
flesh was to arrive earlier than her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) worst misgiving had conjectured.
And when she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had discovered this she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was plunged into a misery which
transcended that of the child's simple loss. Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) baby had not been
baptized.

<p/>Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the
consideration that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) should have to burn for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had done,
burn she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) must, and there was an end of it. Like all village girls,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was well grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and had dutifully
studied the histories of Aholah and Aholibah, and knew the inferences
to be drawn therefrom. But when the same question arose with regard
to the baby, it had a very different colour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) darling was about
to die, and no salvation.

<p/>It was nearly bedtime, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rushed downstairs and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
might send for the parson. The moment happened to be one at which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's sense of the antique nobility of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) family was highest,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon that
nobility most pronounced, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had just returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) weekly
booze at Rolliver's Inn. No parson should come inside his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) door, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
declared, prying into his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) affairs, just then, when, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rolliver</b></font>) shame, it
had become more necessary than ever to hide them. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) locked the door
and put the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) pocket.

<p/>The household went to bed, and, distressed beyond measure, Tess
retired also. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was continually waking as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lay, and in the
middle of the night found that the baby was still worse. It was
obviously dying--quietly and painlessly, but none the less surely.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) misery she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rocked herself upon the bed. The clock struck the
solemn hour of one, that hour when fancy stalks outside reason, and
malignant possibilities stand rock-firm as facts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought of
the child consigned to the nethermost corner of hell, as its double
doom for lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy; saw the arch-fiend
tossing it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) three-pronged fork, like the one they used for
heating the oven on baking days; to which picture she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) added many
other quaint and curious details of torment sometimes taught the
young in this Christian country. The lurid presentment so powerfully
affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) imagination in the silence of the sleeping house that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) nightgown became damp with perspiration, and the bedstead shook
with each throb of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart.

<p/>The infant's breathing grew more difficult, and the mother's mental
tension increased. It was useless to devour the little thing with
kisses; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could stay in bed no longer, and walked feverishly about
the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O merciful God, have pity; have pity upon my poor baby!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried.
<div class="bookquote">``Heap as much anger as you want to upon me, and welcome; but pity the
child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) leant against the chest of drawers, and murmured incoherent
supplications for a long while, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) suddenly started up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! perhaps baby can be saved! Perhaps it will be just the same!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face might have
shone in the gloom surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lit a candle, and went to
a second and a third bed under the wall, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) awoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) young
sisters and brothers, all of whom occupied the same room. Pulling
out the washing-stand so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could get behind it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) poured
some water from a jug, and made them kneel around, putting their
hands together with fingers exactly vertical. While the children,
scarcely awake, awe-stricken at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) manner, their eyes growing larger
and larger, remained in this position, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) took the baby from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
bed--a child's child--so immature as scarce to seem a sufficient
personality to endow its producer with the maternal title. Tess then
stood erect with the infant on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arm beside the basin; the next
sister held the Prayer-Book open before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), as the clerk at church
held it before the parson; and thus the girl set about baptizing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
child.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) figure looked singularly tall and imposing as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
long white nightgown, a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging
straight down her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) waist. The kindly dimness of the weak
candle abstracted from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) form and features the little blemishes
which sunlight might have revealed--the stubble scratches upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
wrists, and the weariness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes--her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) high enthusiasm having
a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) undoing,
showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity
which was almost regal. The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy
eyes blinking and red, awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) preparations full of a suspended
wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to
become active.

<p/>The most impressed of them said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be you really going to christen him (<font color='blue'><b>Heap</b></font>), Tess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's his (<font color='blue'><b>Heap</b></font>) name going to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in
the book of Genesis came into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) proceeded with the
baptismal service, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pronounced it:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``SORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sprinkled the water, and there was silence.

<p/>``Say ``Amen,<div class="bookquote">'' children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The tiny voices piped in obedient response, <div class="bookquote">``Amen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We receive this child'' (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>--and so forth--<div class="bookquote">``and do sign him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) with the sign
of the Cross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand into the basin, and fervently drew an
immense cross upon the baby with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) forefinger, continuing with
the customary sentences as to his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manfully fighting against sin,
the world, and the devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant
unto his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) life's end. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) duly went on with the Lord's Prayer, the
children lisping it after her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in a thin gnat-like wail, till, at the
conclusion, raising their voices to clerk's pitch, they again piped
into silence, <div class="bookquote">``Amen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>Then their sister, with much augmented confidence in the efficacy
of the sacrament, poured forth from the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heart the
thanksgiving that follows, uttering it boldly and triumphantly in the
stopt-diapason note which her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) voice acquired when her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heart was in
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) speech, and which will never be forgotten by those who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).
The ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); it set upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face a
glowing irradiation, and brought a red spot into the middle of each
cheek; while the miniature candle-flame inverted in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eye-pupils
shone like a diamond. The children gazed up at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with more and
more reverence, and no longer had a will for questioning. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did
not look like Sissy to them now, but as a being large, towering, and
awful--a divine personage with whom they had nothing in common.

<p/>Poor Sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was
doomed to be of limited brilliancy--luckily perhaps for himself,
considering his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) beginnings. In the blue of the morning that fragile
soldier and servant breathed his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) last, and when the other children
awoke they cried bitterly, and begged Sissy to have another pretty
baby.

<p/>The calmness which had possessed Tess since the christening remained
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in the infant's loss. In the daylight, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
terrors about his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) soul to have been somewhat exaggerated; whether
well founded or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had no uneasiness now, reasoning that
if Providence would not ratify such an act of approximation
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), for one, did not value the kind of heaven lost by the
irregularity--either for herself or for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) child.

<p/>So passed away Sorrow the Undesired--that intrusive creature, that
bastard gift of shameless Nature, who respects not the social law;
a waif to whom eternal Time had been a matter of days merely, who
knew not that such things as years and centuries ever were; to whom
the cottage interior was the universe, the week's weather climate,
new-born babyhood human existence, and the instinct to suck human
knowledge.

<p/>Tess, who mused on the christening a good deal, wondered if it were
doctrinally sufficient to secure a Christian burial for the child.
Nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was a
new-comer, and did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) house after dusk,
and stood by the gate, but could not summon courage to go in. The
enterprise would have been abandoned if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not by accident met
him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) coming homeward as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned away. In the gloom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not
mind speaking freely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to ask you something, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) willingness to listen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) told the story of the
baby's illness and the extemporized ordinance. <div class="bookquote">``And now, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
added earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``can you tell me this--will it be just the same for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) as if you had baptized him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>)
should have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>)
customers among themselves, he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) was disposed to say no. Yet the
dignity of the girl, the strange tenderness in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice, combined
to affect his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) nobler impulses--or rather those that he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) had left in
him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) after ten years of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual
scepticism. The man and the ecclesiastic fought within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and the
victory fell to the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it will be just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then will you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) a Christian burial?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked quickly.

<p/>The Vicar felt himself cornered. Hearing of the baby's illness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
had conscientiously gone to the house after nightfall to perform the
rite, and, unaware that the refusal to admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had come from Tess's
father and not from Tess, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could not allow the plea of necessity
for its irregular administration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--that's another matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another matter--why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>asked Tess, rather warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I would willingly do so if only we two were concerned. But I
must not--for certain reasons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just for once, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really I must not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) withdrew it, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't like you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) burst out, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll never come to your
church no more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk so rashly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it will be just the same to him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) if you don't? ... Will it
be just the same? Don't for God's sake speak as saint to sinner, but
as you yourself to me myself--poor me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>How the Vicar reconciled his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) answer with the strict notions he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
supposed himself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a layman's
power to tell, though not to excuse. Somewhat moved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said in
this case also--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So the baby was carried in a small deal box, under an ancient woman's
shawl, to the churchyard that night, and buried by lantern-light,
at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton, in that
shabby corner of God's allotment where He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lets the nettles grow,
and where all unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides,
and others of the conjecturally damned are laid. In spite of the
untoward surroundings, however, Tess bravely made a little cross of
two laths and a piece of string, and having bound it with flowers,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stuck it up at the head of the grave one evening when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
enter the churchyard without being seen, putting at the foot also
a bunch of the same flowers in a little jar of water to keep them
alive. What matter was it that on the outside of the jar the eye of
mere observation noted the words <div class="bookquote">``Keelwell's Marmalade'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>? The eye of
maternal affection did not see them in its vision of higher things.



<p/>XV


<p/><div class="bookquote">``By experience,''  (<font color='red'><b>XV</b></font>)</div>says Roger Ascham, <div class="bookquote">``we find out a short way by
a long wandering.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger Ascham</b></font>)</div>Not seldom that long wandering unfits us for
further travel, and of what use is our experience to us then? Tess
Durbeyfield's experience was of this incapacitating kind. At last
she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had learned what to do; but who would now accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) doing?

<p/>If before going to the d``Urbervilles' she (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) had vigorously moved under
the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) and to
the world in general, no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) would never have been imposed on.
But it had not been in Tess's power--nor is it in anybody's power--to
feel the whole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to
profit by them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--and how many more--might have ironically said
to God with Saint Augustine: <div class="bookquote">``Thou hast counselled a better course
than Thou hast permitted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) remained at her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) father's house during the winter months, plucking
fowls, or cramming turkeys and geese, or making clothes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
sisters and brothers out of some finery which d``Urberville had given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) had put by with contempt. Apply to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) would not.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) would often clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) head and muse when she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>)
was supposed to be working hard.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution
of the year; the disastrous night of her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) undoing at Trantridge with
its dark background of The Chase; also the dates of the baby's birth
and death; also her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) own birthday; and every other day individualized
by incidents in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) had taken some share. She (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) suddenly thought
one afternoon, when looking in the glass at her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) fairness, that there
was yet another date, of greater importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) than those; that
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) own death, when all these charms would have disappeared; a day
which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year, giving
no sign or sound when she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) annually passed over it; but not the less
surely there. When was it? Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) not feel the chill of each
yearly encounter with such a cold relation? She (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) had Jeremy Taylor's
thought that some time in the future those who had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) would
say: <div class="bookquote">``It is the --th, the day that poor Tess Durbeyfield died'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>; and
there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement. Of
that day, doomed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) terminus in time through all the ages, she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
did not know the place in month, week, season or year.

<p/>Almost at a leap Tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman.
Symbols of reflectiveness passed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face, and a note of tragedy
at times into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) voice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes grew larger and more eloquent.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) became what would have been called a fine creature; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) aspect
was fair and arresting; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soul that of a woman whom the turbulent
experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize.
But for the world's opinion those experiences would have been simply
a liberal education.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had held so aloof of late that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) trouble, never generally
known, was nearly forgotten in Marlott. But it became evident to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could never be really comfortable again in a place which
had seen the collapse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) family's attempt to <div class="bookquote">``claim kin'' (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>--and,
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), even closer union--with the rich d``Urbervilles. At
least she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) could not be comfortable there till long years should have
obliterated her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) keen consciousness of it. Yet even now Tess felt the
pulse of hopeful life still warm within her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might be happy in
some nook which had no memories. To escape the past and all that
appertained thereto was to annihilate it, and to do that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would
have to get away.

<p/>Was once lost always lost really true of chastity? she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would ask
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might prove it false if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could veil bygones. The
recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not
denied to maidenhood alone.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new
departure. A particularly fine spring came round, and the stir of
germination was almost audible in the buds; it moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), as it moved
the wild animals, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) passionate to go. At last, one day in
early May, a letter reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from a former friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's,
to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had addressed inquiries long before--a person whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had never seen--that a skilful milkmaid was required at a dairy-house
many miles to the southward, and that the dairyman would be glad to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) for the summer months.

<p/>It was not quite so far off as could have been wished; but it was
probably far enough, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) radius of movement and repute having been
so small. To persons of limited spheres, miles are as geographical
degrees, parishes as counties, counties as provinces and kingdoms.

<p/>On one point she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was resolved: there should be no more d``Urberville
air-castles in the dreams and deeds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) new life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would be
the dairymaid Tess, and nothing more. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother knew Tess's feeling
on this point so well, though no words had passed between them on the
subject, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) never alluded to the knightly ancestry now.

<p/>Yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the
new place to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was the accidental virtues of its lying near her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
forefathers' country -LRB-for they were not Blakemore men, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
mother was Blakemore to the bone-RRB-. The dairy called Talbothays,
for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was bound, stood not remotely from some of the former
estates of the d``Urbervilles, near the great family vaults of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
granddames and their powerful husbands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would be able to look at
them, and think not only that d``Urberville, like Babylon, had fallen,
but that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse
as silently. All the while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wondered if any strange good thing
might come of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) being in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ancestral land; and some spirit within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rose automatically as the sap in the twigs. It was unexpected
youth, surging up anew after its temporary check, and bringing with
it hope, and the invincible instinct towards self-delight.


<p/>END OF PHASE THE SECOND





<p/>Phase the Third: The Rally



<p/>XVI


<p/>On a thyme-scented, bird-hatching morning in May, between two and
three years after the return from Trantridge--silent, reconstructive
years for Tess Durbeyfield--she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) home for the second time.

<p/>Having packed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) luggage so that it could be sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) later,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) started in a hired trap for the little town of Stourcastle,
through which it was necessary to pass on her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) journey, now in a
direction almost opposite to that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) first adventuring. On the
curve of the nearest hill she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) looked back regretfully at Marlott and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) father's house, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had been so anxious to get away.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily
lives as heretofore, with no great diminution of pleasure in their
consciousness, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) would be far off, and they deprived of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) smile. In a few days the children would engage in their games as
merrily as ever, without the sense of any gap left by her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) departure.
This leaving of the younger children she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had decided to be for the
best; were she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) to remain they would probably gain less good by her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
precepts than harm by her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) example.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) went through Stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction
of highways, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) could await a carrier's van that ran to the
south-west; for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of
country had never yet struck across it. While waiting, however,
there came along a farmer in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) spring cart, driving approximately
in the direction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) wished to pursue. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was a stranger
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) offer of a seat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), ignoring that
its motive was a mere tribute to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) countenance. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was going to
Weatherbury, and by accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) thither she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) could walk the
remainder of the distance instead of travelling in the van by way of
Casterbridge.

<p/>Tess did not stop at Weatherbury, after this long drive, further than
to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the
farmer recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Thence she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) started on foot, basket in hand,
to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the
low-lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was
the aim and end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) day's pilgrimage.

<p/>Tess had never before visited this part of the country, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
felt akin to the landscape. Not so very far to the left of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
could discern a dark patch in the scenery, which inquiry confirmed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in supposing to be trees marking the environs of Kingsbere--in
the church of which parish the bones of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ancestors--her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) useless
ancestors--lay entombed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had no admiration for them now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) almost hated them for the
dance they had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); not a thing of all that had been theirs did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) retain but the old seal and spoon. <div class="bookquote">``Pooh--I have as much of
mother as father in me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``All my prettiness comes from
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was only a dairymaid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Egdon/Egdon Heath</b></font>)</div><p/>The journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of Egdon,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reached them, was a more troublesome walk than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
anticipated, the distance being actually but a few miles. It was
two hours, owing to sundry wrong turnings, ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found herself
on a summit commanding the long-sought-for vale, the Valley of the
Great Dairies, the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness,
and were produced more profusely, if less delicately, than at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
home--the verdant plain so well watered by the river Var or Froom.

<p/>It was intrinsically different from the Vale of Little Dairies,
Blackmoor Vale, which, save during her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) disastrous sojourn at
Trantridge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had exclusively known till now. The world was drawn
to a larger pattern here. The enclosures numbered fifty acres
instead of ten, the farmsteads were more extended, the groups of
cattle formed tribes hereabout; there only families. These myriads
of cows stretching under her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes from the far east to the far west
outnumbered any she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had ever seen at one glance before. The green
lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by Van Alsloot
or Sallaert with burghers. The ripe hue of the red and dun kine
absorbed the evening sunlight, which the white-coated animals
returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling, even at the distant
elevation on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stood.

<p/>The bird's-eye perspective before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was not so luxuriantly
beautiful, perhaps, as that other one which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew so well; yet it
was more cheering. It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the
rival vale, and its heavy soils and scents; the new air was clear,
bracing, ethereal. The river itself, which nourished the grass
and cows of these renowned dairies, flowed not like the streams in
Blackmoor. Those were slow, silent, often turbid; flowing over
beds of mud into which the incautious wader might sink and vanish
unawares. The Froom waters were clear as the pure River of Life
shown to the Evangelist, rapid as the shadow of a cloud, with
pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all day long. There the
water-flower was the lily; the crow-foot here.

<p/>Either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light, or
the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>), sent up her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) spirits wonderfully. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) hopes mingled with
the sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>)
bounded along against the soft south wind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) heard a pleasant
voice in every breeze, and in every bird's note seemed to lurk a
joy.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) face had latterly changed with changing states of mind,
continually fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness, according as
the thoughts were gay or grave. One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) was pink and flawless;
another pale and tragical. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) was pink she (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) was feeling less
than when pale; her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) more perfect beauty accorded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) less
elevated mood; her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) more intense mood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) less perfect beauty.
It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) best face physically that was now set against the south
wind.

<p/>The irresistible, universal, automatic tendency to find sweet
pleasure somewhere, which pervades all life, from the meanest to the
highest, had at length mastered Tess. Being even now only a young
woman of twenty, one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished
growing, it was impossible that any event should have left upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
an impression that was not in time capable of transmutation.

<p/>And thus her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spirits, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thankfulness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hopes, rose
higher and higher. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried several ballads, but found them
inadequate; till, recollecting the psalter that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes had so often
wandered over of a Sunday morning before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had eaten of the tree
of knowledge, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chanted: <div class="bookquote">``O ye Sun and Moon ... O ye Stars ... ye
Green Things upon the Earth ... ye Fowls of the Air ... Beasts and
Cattle ... Children of Men ... bless ye the Lord, praise Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) and
magnify Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) for ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suddenly stopped and murmured: <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps I don't quite know
the Lord as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>And probably the half-unconscious rhapsody was a Fetishistic
utterance in a Monotheistic setting; women whose chief companions
are the forms and forces of outdoor Nature retain in their souls far
more of the Pagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the
systematized religion taught their race at later date. However, Tess
found at least approximate expression for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feelings in the old
_Benedicite_ that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had lisped from infancy; and it was enough.
Such high contentment with such a slight initial performance as that
of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of
the Durbeyfield temperament. Tess really wished to walk uprightly,
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father did nothing of the kind; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) resembled him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in
being content with immediate and small achievements, and in having no
mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as
could alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the
once powerful d``Urbervilles were now.

<p/>There was, it might be said, the energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's unexpended
family, as well as the natural energy of Tess's years, rekindled
after the experience which had so overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) for the time. Let
the truth be told--women do as a rule live through such humiliations,
and regain their spirits, and again look about them with an
interested eye. While there's life there's hope is a conviction not
so entirely unknown to the <div class="bookquote">``betrayed''  (<font color='red'><b>some theorists</b></font>)</div>as some amiable theorists would
have us believe.

<p/>Tess Durbeyfield, then, in good heart, and full of zest for life,
descended the Egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
pilgrimage.

<p/>The marked difference, in the final particular, between the rival
vales now showed itself. The secret of Blackmoor was best discovered
from the heights around; to read aright the valley before her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) it was
necessary to descend into its midst. When Tess had accomplished this
feat she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found herself to be standing on a carpeted level, which
stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach.

<p/>The river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles
to the vale all this horizontal land; and now, exhausted, aged, and
attenuated, lay serpentining along through the midst of its former
spoils.

<p/>Not quite sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) direction, Tess stood still upon the hemmed
expanse of verdant flatness, like a fly on a billiard-table of
indefinite length, and of no more consequence to the surroundings
than that fly. The sole effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) presence upon the placid
valley so far had been to excite the mind of a solitary heron, which,
after descending to the ground not far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) path, stood with neck
erect, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>Suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and
repeated call--<div class="bookquote">``Waow! waow! waow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div><p/>From the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by
contagion, accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog. It was
not the expression of the valley's consciousness that beautiful Tess
had arrived, but the ordinary announcement of milking-time--half-past
four o'clock, when the dairymen set about getting in the cows.

<p/>The red and white herd nearest at hand, which had been phlegmatically
waiting for the call, now trooped towards the steading in the
background, their great bags of milk swinging under them as they
walked. Tess followed slowly in their rear, and entered the barton
by the open gate through which they had entered before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Long
thatched sheds stretched round the enclosure, their slopes encrusted
with vivid green moss, and their eaves supported by wooden posts
rubbed to a glossy smoothness by the flanks of infinite cows
and calves of bygone years, now passed to an oblivion almost
inconceivable in its profundity. Between the post were ranged
the milchers, each exhibiting herself at the present moment to a
whimsical eye in the rear as a circle on two stalks, down the centre
of which a switch moved pendulum-wise; while the sun, lowering itself
behind this patient row, threw their shadows accurately inwards upon
the wall. Thus it threw shadows of these obscure and homely figures
every evening with as much care over each contour as if it had been
the profile of a court beauty on a palace wall; copied them as
diligently as it had copied Olympian shapes on marble _façades_ long
ago, or the outline of Alexander, Caesar, and the Pharaohs.

<p/>They were the less restful cows that were stalled. Those that would
stand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard,
where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting now--all prime
milchers, such as were seldom seen out of this valley, and not always
within it; nourished by the succulent feed which the water-meads
supplied at this prime season of the year. Those of them that were
spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy,
and the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something
of military display. Their large-veined udders hung ponderous as
sandbags, the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy's crock;
and as each animal lingered for her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) turn to arrive the milk oozed
forth and fell in drops to the ground.



<p/>XVII


<p/>The dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out
of the dairy-house with the arrival of the cows from the meads; the
maids walking in pattens, not on account of the weather, but to keep
their shoes above the mulch of the barton. Each girl sat down on
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) three-legged stool, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face sideways, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) right cheek resting
against the cow, and looked musingly along the animal's flank at Tess
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) approached. The male milkers, with hat-brims turned down,
resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground, did not
observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>One of these was a sturdy middle-aged man--whose long white <div class="bookquote">``pinner''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and
whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect--the
master-dairyman, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was in quest, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) double character as
a working milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the
seventh as a man in shining broad-cloth in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family pew at church,
being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme:


<p/>Dairyman Dick
All the week:--
On Sundays Mister Richard Crick.


<p/>Seeing Tess standing at gaze he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) went across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>The majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time, but it
happened that Mr Crick was glad to get a new hand--for the days were
busy ones now--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) received her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) warmly; inquiring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother
and the rest of the family---LRB-though this as a matter of form merely,
for in reality he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) had not been aware of Mrs Durbeyfield's existence
till apprised of the fact by a brief business-letter about Tess-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--ay, as a lad I knowed your part o' the country very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>)
said terminatively. <div class="bookquote">``Though I've never been there since. And a aged
woman of ninety that use to live nigh here, but is dead and gone long
ago, told me that a family of some such name as yours in Blackmoor
Vale came originally from these parts, and that `twere a old ancient
race that had all but perished off the earth--though the new
generations didn't know it. But, Lord, I took no notice of the old
woman's ramblings, not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--it is nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/>Then the talk was of business only.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can milk 'em clean, my maidy? I don't want my cows going azew at
this time o' year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) on that point, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) up and down.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been staying indoors a good deal, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) complexion had
grown delicate.

<p/>``Quite sure you can stand it? <div class="bookquote">``Tis comfortable enough here for rough
folk; but we don't live in a cowcumber frame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could stand it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) zest and willingness
seemed to win him (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose you'll want a dish o' tay, or victuals of some sort,
hey? Not yet? Well, do as ye like about it. But faith, if 'twas I,
I should be as dry as a kex wi' travelling so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll begin milking now, to get my hand in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) drank a little milk as temporary refreshment--to the
surprise--indeed, slight contempt--of Dairyman Crick, to whose mind
it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if ye can swaller that, be it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) said indifferently, while
holding up the pail that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sipped from. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis what I hain't
touched for years--not I. Rot the stuff; it would lie in my innerds
like lead. You can try your hand upon she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) pursued, nodding to
the nearest cow. <div class="bookquote">``Not but what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) do milk rather hard. We've hard
ones and we've easy ones, like other folks. However, you'll find out
that soon enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>When Tess had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bonnet for a hood, and was really on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
stool under the cow, and the milk was squirting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fists
into the pail, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) appeared to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) really had laid a new
foundation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) future. The conviction bred serenity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pulse
slowed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was able to look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the
men operating on the hard-teated animals, the maids on the kindlier
natures. It was a large dairy. There were nearly a hundred
milchers under Crick's management, all told; and of the herd the
master-dairyman milked six or eight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) own hands, unless away
from home. These were the cows that milked hardest of all; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>)
journey-milkmen being more or less casually hired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) would not
entrust this half-dozen to their treatment, lest, from indifference,
they should not milk them fully; nor to the maids, lest they should
fail in the same way for lack of finger-grip; with the result that in
course of time the cows would <div class="bookquote">``go azew'' (<font color='red'><b>the maids</b></font>)</div>--that is, dry up. It was not
the loss for the moment that made slack milking so serious, but that
with the decline of demand there came decline, and ultimately
cessation, of supply.

<p/>After Tess had settled down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cow there was for a time no talk
in the barton, and not a sound interfered with the purr of the
milk-jets into the numerous pails, except a momentary exclamation
to one or other of the beasts requesting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to turn round or stand
still. The only movements were those of the milkers' hands up and
down, and the swing of the cows' tails. Thus they all worked on,
encompassed by the vast flat mead which extended to either slope
of the valley--a level landscape compounded of old landscapes long
forgotten, and, no doubt, differing in character very greatly from
the landscape they composed now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To my thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>said the dairyman, rising suddenly from a cow
he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) had just finished off, snatching up his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) three-legged stool in
one hand and the pail in the other, and moving on to the next
hard-yielder in his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) vicinity, <div class="bookquote">``to my thinking, the cows don't gie
down their milk to-day as usual. Upon my life, if Winker do begin
keeping back like this, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll not be worth going under by
midsummer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis because there's a new hand come among us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jonathan/Jonathan Kail</b></font>)</div>said Jonathan Kail.
<div class="bookquote">``I've noticed such things afore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure. It may be so. I didn't think o`t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a dairymaid</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been told that it goes up into their horns at such times,''  (<font color='red'><b>a dairymaid</b></font>)</div>said
a dairymaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as to going up into their horns,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dairyman Crick/Crick</b></font>)</div>replied Dairyman Crick
dubiously, as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical
possibilities, <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't say; I certainly could not. But as nott
cows will keep it back as well as the horned ones, I don't quite
agree to it. Do ye know that riddle about the nott cows, Jonathan?
Why do nott cows give less milk in a year than horned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dairyman Crick/Crick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>the milkmaid</b></font>)</div>interposed the milkmaid, <div class="bookquote">``Why do they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the milkmaid</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because there bain't so many of 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>said the dairyman.
<div class="bookquote">``Howsomever, these gam`sters do certainly keep back their milk
to-day. Folks, we must lift up a stave or two--that's the only cure
for`t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Songs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement
to the cows when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield;
and the band of milkers at this request burst into melody--in purely
business-like tones, it is true, and with no great spontaneity; the
result, according to their own belief, being a decided improvement
during the song's continuance. When they had gone through fourteen
or fifteen verses of a cheerful ballad about a murderer who was
afraid to go to bed in the dark because he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) saw certain brimstone
flames around him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>), one of the male milkers said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish singing on the stoop didn't use up so much of a man's wind!
You should get your harp, sir; not but what a fiddle is best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess, who had given ear to this, thought the words were addressed to
the dairyman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was wrong. A reply, in the shape of <div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls; it had
been spoken by a milker behind the animal, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not hitherto
perceived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; there's nothing like a fiddle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>said the dairyman. ``Though
I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows--at least
that's my experience. Once there was an old aged man over at
Mellstock--William Dewy by name--one of the family that used to do
a good deal of business as tranters over there--Jonathan, do ye
mind?--I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother, in
a manner of speaking. Well, this man was a coming home along from a
wedding, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been playing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fiddle, one fine moonlight
night, and for shortness' sake he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took a cut across Forty-acres, a
field lying that way, where a bull was out to grass. The bull seed
William, and took after him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), horns aground, begad; and though William
runned his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) best, and hadn't MUCH drink in him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) -LRB-considering 'twas a
wedding, and the folks well off-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'d never reach the fence
and get over in time to save himself. Well, as a last thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) fiddle as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) runned, and struck up a jig, turning to
the bull, and backing towards the corner. The bull softened down,
and stood still, looking hard at William Dewy, who fiddled on and on;
till a sort of a smile stole over the bull's face. But no sooner
did William stop his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) playing and turn to get over hedge than the
bull would stop his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) smiling and lower his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) horns towards the seat of
William's breeches. Well, William had to turn about and play on,
willy-nilly; and 'twas only three o'clock in the world, and 'a knowed
that nobody would come that way for hours, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) so leery and tired
that 'a didn't know what to do. When he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had scraped till about four
o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) verily would have to give over soon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
said to himself, ``There's only this last tune between me and eternal
welfare! Heaven save me, or I'm a done man.'' Well, then he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) called to
mind how he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>)'d seen the cattle kneel o' Christmas Eves in the dead o'
night. It was not Christmas Eve then, but it came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Eves</b></font>) head to
play a trick upon the bull. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Eves</b></font>) broke into the ``Tivity Hymm, just
as at Christmas carol-singing; when, lo and behold, down went the
bull on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bended knees, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ignorance, just as if `twere the
true <div class="bookquote">``Tivity night and hour. As soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horned friend were down,
William turned, clinked off like a long-dog, and jumped safe over
hedge, before the praying bull had got on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) feet again to take
after him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). William used to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'d seen a man look a fool
a good many times, but never such a fool as that bull looked when
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pious feelings had been played upon, and 'twas not
Christmas Eve. ... Yes, William Dewy, that was the man's name; and
I can tell you to a foot where's he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewy</b></font>) a-lying in Mellstock Churchyard
at this very moment--just between the second yew-tree and the north
aisle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a curious story; it carries us back to medieval times, when
faith was a living thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The remark, singular for a dairy-yard, was murmured by the voice
behind the dun cow; but as nobody understood the reference, no notice
was taken, except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply
scepticism as to his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) tale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `tis quite true, sir, whether or no. I knowed the man well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; I have no doubt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>said the person behind the dun cow.

<p/>Tess's attention was thus attracted to the dairyman's interlocutor,
of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could see but the merest patch, owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>interlocutor</b></font>) burying his (<font color='blue'><b>interlocutor</b></font>)
head so persistently in the flank of the milcher. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not
understand why he (<font color='blue'><b>interlocutor</b></font>) should be addressed as <div class="bookquote">``sir''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>even by the dairyman
himself. But no explanation was discernible; he (<font color='blue'><b>interlocutor</b></font>) remained under the
cow long enough to have milked three, uttering a private ejaculation
now and then, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>interlocutor</b></font>) could not get on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it gentle, sir; take it gentle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>said the dairyman. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis
knack, not strength, that does it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I find,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, standing up at last and stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>)
arms. <div class="bookquote">``I think I have finished her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), however, though she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made my
fingers ache.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess could then see him (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) at full length. He (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) wore the ordinary white
pinner and leather leggings of a dairy-farmer when milking, and his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>)
boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard; but this was all his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>)
local livery. Beneath it was something educated, reserved, subtle,
sad, differing.

<p/>But the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) aspect were temporarily thrust aside by
the discovery that he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) was one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had seen before. Such
vicissitudes had Tess passed through since that time that for a
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not remember where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>); and then it
flashed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) was the pedestrian who had joined in the
club-dance at Marlott--the passing stranger who had come she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew
not whence, had danced with others but not with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and slightingly
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and gone on his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) way with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) friends.

<p/>The flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident
anterior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) troubles produced a momentary dismay lest,
recognizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) also, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) should by some means discover her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) story.
But it passed away when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found no sign of remembrance in him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mobile
face had grown more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man's
shapely moustache and beard--the latter of the palest straw colour
where it began upon his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther
from its root. Under his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) linen milking-pinner he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wore a dark
velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white
shirt. Without the milking-gear nobody could have guessed what
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) might with equal probability have been an eccentric
landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. That he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was but a novice at
dairy work she (<font color='blue'><b>ploughman</b></font>) had realized in a moment, from the time he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had spent
upon the milking of one cow.

<p/>Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the
newcomer, <div class="bookquote">``How pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>the newcomer</b></font>)</div>with something of real generosity and
admiration, though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify
the assertion--which, strictly speaking, they might have done,
prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in
Tess. When the milking was finished for the evening they straggled
indoors, where Mrs Crick, the dairyman's wife--who was too
respectable to go out milking herself, and wore a hot stuff gown in
warm weather because the dairymaids wore prints--was giving an eye
to the leads and things.

<p/>Only two or three of the maids, Tess learnt, slept in the dairy-house
besides herself, most of the helpers going to their homes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw
nothing at supper-time of the superior milker who had commented on
the story, and asked no questions about him (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>), the remainder of the
evening being occupied in arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) place in the bed-chamber.
It was a large room over the milk-house, some thirty feet long; the
sleeping-cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same
apartment. They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather
older than herself. By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired, and fell
asleep immediately.

<p/>But one of the girls, who occupied an adjoining bed, was more wakeful
than Tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various
particulars of the homestead into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had just entered. The
girl's whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess's drowsy
mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they
floated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Angel Clare--he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) that is learning milking, and that plays
the harp--never says much to us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is a pa`son's son, and is
too much taken up wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own thoughts to notice girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is
the dairyman's pupil--learning farming in all its branches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
has learnt sheep-farming at another place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'s now mastering
dairy-work... Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is quite the gentleman-born. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father is
the Reverent Mr Clare at Emminster--a good many miles from here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) companion, now awake. <div class="bookquote">``A very
earnest clergyman, is he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is--the earnestest man in all Wessex, they say--the
last of the old Low Church sort, they tell me--for all about here be
what they call High. All his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) sons, except our Mr Clare, be made
pa`sons too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present Mr
Clare was not made a parson like his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) brethren, and gradually fell
asleep again, the words of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) informant coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) along with the
smell of the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft, and the measured
dripping of the whey from the wrings downstairs.



<p/>XVIII


<p/>Angel Clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct
figure, but as an appreciative voice, a long regard of fixed,
abstracted eyes, and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and
delicately lined for a man's, though with an unexpectedly firm close
of the lower lip now and then; enough to do away with any inference
of indecision. Nevertheless, something nebulous, preoccupied, vague,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) bearing and regard, marked him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) as one who probably had no very
definite aim or concern about his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) material future. Yet as a lad
people had said of him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was one who might do anything if he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
tried.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was the youngest son of his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) father, a poor parson at the other end
of the county, and had arrived at Talbothays Dairy as a six months'
pupil, after going the round of some other farms, his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) object being
to acquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming,
with a view either to the Colonies or the tenure of a home-farm, as
circumstances might decide.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a
step in the young man's career which had been anticipated neither
by himself nor by others.

<p/>Mr Clare the elder, whose first wife had died and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) a
daughter, married a second late in life. This lady had somewhat
unexpectedly brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) three sons, so that between Angel, the
youngest, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father the Vicar there seemed to be almost a
missing generation. Of these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) old age, was the only son who had not taken a University degree,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was the single one of them whose early promise might have
done full justice to an academical training.

<p/>Some two or three years before Angel's appearance at the Marlott
dance, on a day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had left school and was pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) studies
at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller's,
directed to the Reverend James Clare. The Vicar having opened it and
found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) jumped up
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why has this been sent to my house?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) asked peremptorily, holding
up the volume.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was ordered, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The shopkeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The shopkeeper looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) order-book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it has been misdirected, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It was ordered by Mr
Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Clare winced as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had been struck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went home pale and
dejected, and called Angel into his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) study.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look into this book, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What do you know about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ordered it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you think of reading it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I? Why--it is a system of philosophy. There is no more
moral, or even religious, work published.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--moral enough; I don't deny that. But religious!--and for YOU,
who intend to be a minister of the Gospel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you have alluded to the matter, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son, with
anxious thought upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to say, once for
all, that I should prefer not to take Orders. I fear I could not
conscientiously do so. I love the Church as one loves a parent.
I shall always have the warmest affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). There is no
institution for whose history I have a deeper admiration; but I
cannot honestly be ordained her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) minister, as my brothers are, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) refuses to liberate her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mind from an untenable redemptive
theolatry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div><p/>It had never occurred to the straightforward and simple-minded Vicar
that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own flesh and blood could come to this! He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was
stultified, shocked, paralysed. And if Angel were not going to
enter the Church, what was the use of sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) to Cambridge? The
University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man
of fixed ideas, a preface without a volume. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man not merely
religious, but devout; a firm believer--not as the phrase is now
elusively construed by theological thimble-riggers in the Church and
out of it, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school:
one who could


<p/>Indeed opine
That the Eternal and Divine
Did, eighteen centuries ago
In very truth...


<p/>Angel's father tried argument, persuasion, entreaty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father; I cannot underwrite Article Four -LRB-leave alone the rest-RRB-,
taking it `in the literal and grammatical sense' as required by the
Declaration; and, therefore, I can't be a parson in the present state
of affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel. <div class="bookquote">``My whole instinct in matters of religion
is towards reconstruction; to quote your favorite Epistle to the
Hebrews, `the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things
that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting
ourselves to give you a University education, if it is not to be used
for the honour and glory of God?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that it may be used for the honour and glory of man, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps if Angel had persevered he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) might have gone to Cambridge like
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) brothers. But the Vicar's view of that seat of learning as a
stepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so
rooted was the idea in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mind that perseverance began to appear to
the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and
wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
father had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out
this uniform plan of education for the three young men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do without Cambridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel at last. <div class="bookquote">``I feel that I
have no right to go there in the circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing
themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) spent years and years in desultory studies,
undertakings, and meditations; he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) began to evince considerable
indifference to social forms and observances. The material
distinctions of rank and wealth he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) increasingly despised. Even the
<div class="bookquote">``good old family''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy-RRB-
had no aroma for him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) unless there were good new resolutions in its
representatives. As a balance to these austerities, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) went to
live in London to see what the world was like, and with a view to
practising a profession or business there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
head, and nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself, though
luckily he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) escaped not greatly the worse for the experience.

<p/>Early association with country solitudes had bred in him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) an
unconquerable, and almost unreasonable, aversion to modern town life,
and shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) out from such success as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) might have aspired to by
following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual
one. But something had to be done; he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had wasted many valuable
years; and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life
as a Colonial farmer, it occurred to Angel that this might be a lead
in the right direction. Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or
at home--farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the
business by a careful apprenticeship--that was a vocation which would
probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
valued even more than a competency--intellectual liberty.

<p/>So we find Angel Clare at six-and-twenty here at Talbothays as a
student of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman's.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the
dairy-house. It could only be reached by a ladder from the
cheese-loft, and had been closed up for a long time till he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) arrived
and selected it as his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) retreat. Here Clare had plenty of space, and
could often be heard by the dairy-folk pacing up and down when the
household had gone to rest. A portion was divided off at one end by
a curtain, behind which was his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) bed, the outer part being furnished
as a homely sitting-room.

<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lived up above entirely, reading a good deal, and
strumming upon an old harp which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had bought at a sale, saying when
in a bitter humour that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) might have to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) living by it in the
streets some day. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) soon preferred to read human nature by
taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) meals downstairs in the general dining-kitchen, with the
dairyman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife, and the maids and men, who all together formed
a lively assembly; for though but few milking hands slept in the
house, several joined the family at meals. The longer Clare resided
here the less objection had he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) company, and the more did he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
like to share quarters with them in common.

<p/>Much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) took, indeed, a real delight in their
companionship. The conventional farm-folk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) imagination--
personified in the newspaper-press by the pitiable dummy known as
Hodge--were obliterated after a few days' residence. At close
quarters no Hodge was to be seen. At first, it is true, when Clare's
intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society, these friends with
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) now hobnobbed seemed a little strange. Sitting down as a
level member of the dairyman's household seemed at the outset an
undignified proceeding. The ideas, the modes, the surroundings,
appeared retrogressive and unmeaning. But with living on there,
day after day, the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect
in the spectacle. Without any objective change whatever, variety
had taken the place of monotonousness. His (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) host and his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) host's
household, his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) men and his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) maids, as they became intimately known to
Clare, began to differentiate themselves as in a chemical process.
The thought of Pascal's was brought home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pascal</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">''_A mesure qu'on a
plus d'esprit, on trouve qu'il y a plus d'hommes originaux. Les
gens du commun ne trouvent pas de différence entre les hommes._''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The typical and unvarying Hodge ceased to exist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hodge</b></font>) had been
disintegrated into a number of varied fellow-creatures--beings of
many minds, beings infinite in difference; some happy, many serene, a
few depressed, one here and there bright even to genius, some stupid,
others wanton, others austere; some mutely Miltonic, some potentially
Cromwellian--into men who had private views of each other, as he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had
of his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) friends; who could applaud or condemn each other, amuse or
sadden themselves by the contemplation of each other's foibles or
vices; men every one of whom walked in his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) own individual way the
road to dusty death.

<p/>Unexpectedly he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) began to like the outdoor life for its own sake,
and for what it brought, apart from its bearing on his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) own proposed
career. Considering his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) position he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) became wonderfully free from the
chronic melancholy which is taking hold of the civilized races with
the decline of belief in a beneficent Power. For the first time of
late years he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) could read as his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) musings inclined him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>), without any eye
to cramming for a profession, since the few farming handbooks which
he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) deemed it desirable to master occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) but little time.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) grew away from old associations, and saw something new in life and
humanity. Secondarily, he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) made close acquaintance with phenomena
which he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had before known but darkly--the seasons in their moods,
morning and evening, night and noon, winds in their different
tempers, trees, waters and mists, shades and silences, and the voices
of inanimate things.


<p/>The early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire
acceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted; and, by
Mrs Crick's orders, who held that he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) was too genteel to mess at
their table, it was Angel Clare's custom to sit in the yawning
chimney-corner during the meal, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) cup-and-saucer and plate being
placed on a hinged flap at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) elbow. The light from the long, wide,
mullioned window opposite shone in upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) nook, and, assisted by a
secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney,
enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to read there easily whenever disposed to do so. Between
Clare and the window was the table at which his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) companions sat, their
munching profiles rising sharp against the panes; while to the side
was the milk-house door, through which were visible the rectangular
leads in rows, full to the brim with the morning's milk. At the
further end the great churn could be seen revolving, and its
slip-slopping heard--the moving power being discernible through the
window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and
driven by a boy.

<p/>For several days after Tess's arrival Clare, sitting abstractedly
reading from some book, periodical, or piece of music just come by
post, hardly noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was present at table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) talked so
little, and the other maids talked so much, that the babble did not
strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) as possessing a new note, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was ever in the habit
of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general
impression. One day, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had been conning one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
music-scores, and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lapsed into listlessness, and the music-sheet rolled
to the hearth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) looked at the fire of logs, with its one flame
pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfast-cooking
and boiling, and it seemed to jig to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) inward tune; also at the two
chimney crooks dangling down from the cotterel, or cross-bar, plumed
with soot, which quivered to the same melody; also at the half-empty
kettle whining an accompaniment. The conversation at the table mixed
in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) phantasmal orchestra till he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``What a fluty voice
one of those milkmaids has! I suppose it is the new one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare looked round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), seated with the others.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was not looking towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). Indeed, owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) long silence,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) presence in the room was almost forgotten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about ghosts,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was saying; <div class="bookquote">``but I do know that our
souls can be made to go outside our bodies when we are alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The dairyman turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) mouth full, his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) eyes charged
with serious inquiry, and his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) great knife and fork -LRB-breakfasts were
breakfasts here-RRB- planted erect on the table, like the beginning of
a gallows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--really now? And is it so, maidy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very easy way to feel 'em go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>continued Tess, <div class="bookquote">``is to lie on the
grass at night and look straight up at some big bright star; and, by
fixing your mind upon it, you will soon find that you are hundreds
and hundreds o' miles away from your body, which you don't seem to
want at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The dairyman removed his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) hard gaze from Tess, and fixed it on his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>)
wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that's a rum thing, Christianer--hey? To think o' the miles
I've vamped o' starlight nights these last thirty year, courting, or
trading, or for doctor, or for nurse, and yet never had the least
notion o' that till now, or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch
above my shirt-collar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The general attention being drawn to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), including that of the
dairyman's pupil, Tess flushed, and remarking evasively that it was
only a fancy, resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) breakfast.

<p/>Clare continued to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soon finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eating, and
having a consciousness that Clare was regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), began to trace
imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) forefinger with the
constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
said to himself.

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) seemed to discern in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) something that was familiar,
something which carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) back into a joyous and unforeseeing past,
before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) before; where he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not tell. A
casual encounter during some country ramble it certainly had been,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was not greatly curious about it. But the circumstance was
sufficient to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to select Tess in preference to the other
pretty milkmaids when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wished to contemplate contiguous womankind.



<p/>XIX


<p/>In general the cows were milked as they presented themselves, without
fancy or choice. But certain cows will show a fondness for a
particular pair of hands, sometimes carrying this predilection so far
as to refuse to stand at all except to their favourite, the pail of a
stranger being unceremoniously kicked over.

<p/>It was Dairyman Crick's rule to insist on breaking down these
partialities and aversions by constant interchange, since otherwise,
in the event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy, he (<font color='blue'><b>milkman</b></font>) was
placed in a difficulty. The maids' private aims, however, were the
reverse of the dairyman's rule, the daily selection by each damsel of
the eight or ten cows to which she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) had grown accustomed rendering the
operation on their willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless.

<p/>Tess, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) compeers, soon discovered which of the cows had a
preference for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) style of manipulation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fingers having
become delicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had subjected herself at intervals during the last two or three
years, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have been glad to meet the milchers' views in
this respect. Out of the whole ninety-five there were eight in
particular--Dumpling, Fancy, Lofty, Mist, Old Pretty, Young Pretty,
Tidy, and Loud--who, though the teats of one or two were as hard as
carrots, gave down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with a readiness that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) work on them
a mere touch of the fingers. Knowing, however, the dairyman's wish,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) endeavoured conscientiously to take the animals just as they
came, excepting the very hard yielders which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not yet
manage.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly
chance position of the cows and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wishes in this matter, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
felt that their order could not be the result of accident. The
dairyman's pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of
late, and at the fifth or sixth time she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
rested against the cow, full of sly inquiry upon him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Clare, you have ranged the cows!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, blushing; and in
making the accusation, symptoms of a smile gently lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) upper
lip in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), so as to show the tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) teeth, the lower
lip remaining severely still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it makes no difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You will always be here to
milk them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so? I HOPE I shall! But I don't KNOW.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was angry with herself afterwards, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), unaware of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) grave reasons for liking this seclusion, might have mistaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
meaning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had spoken so earnestly to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), as if his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) presence
were somehow a factor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wish. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) misgiving was such that at
dusk, when the milking was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walked in the garden alone, to
continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) regrets that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had disclosed to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) discovery of
his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) considerateness.

<p/>It was a typical summer evening in June, the atmosphere being in
such delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects
seemed endowed with two or three senses, if not five. There was no
distinction between the near and the far, and an auditor felt close
to everything within the horizon. The soundlessness impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as
a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise. It was
broken by the strumming of strings.

<p/>Tess had heard those notes in the attic above her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head. Dim,
flattened, constrained by their confinement, they had never appealed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as now, when they wandered in the still air with a stark
quality like that of nudity. To speak absolutely, both instrument
and execution were poor; but the relative is all, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) listened
Tess, like a fascinated bird, could not leave the spot. Far from
leaving she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) drew up towards the performer, keeping behind the hedge
that he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) might not guess her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) presence.

<p/>The outskirt of the garden in which Tess found herself had been
left uncultivated for some years, and was now damp and rank with
juicy grass which sent up mists of pollen at a touch; and with tall
blooming weeds emitting offensive smells--weeds whose red and yellow
and purple hues formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated
flowers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of
growth, gathering cuckoo-spittle on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) skirts, cracking snails that
were underfoot, staining her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hands with thistle-milk and slug-slime,
and rubbing off upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) naked arms sticky blights which, though
snow-white on the apple-tree trunks, made madder stains on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) skin;
thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) drew quite near to Clare, still unobserved of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>Tess was conscious of neither time nor space. The exaltation which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had described as being producible at will by gazing at a star
came now without any determination of hers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) undulated upon the
thin notes of the second-hand harp, and their harmonies passed like
breezes through her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), bringing tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes. The floating
pollen seemed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) notes made visible, and the dampness of
the garden the weeping of the garden's sensibility. Though near
nightfall, the rank-smelling weed-flowers glowed as if they would not
close for intentness, and the waves of colour mixed with the waves of
sound.

<p/>The light which still shone was derived mainly from a large hole in
the western bank of cloud; it was like a piece of day left behind
by accident, dusk having closed in elsewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
plaintive melody, a very simple performance, demanding no great
skill; and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) waited, thinking another might be begun. But, tired
of playing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had desultorily come round the fence, and was rambling
up behind her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). Tess, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheeks on fire, moved away furtively, as if
hardly moving at all.

<p/>Angel, however, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) light summer gown, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) spoke; his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) low
tones reaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was some distance off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you draw off in that way, Tess?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Are you
afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, sir--not of outdoor things; especially just now when the
apple-blooth is falling, and everything is so green.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have your indoor fears--eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't quite say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The milk turning sour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Life in general?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--so have I, very often. This hobble of being alive is rather
serious, don't you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is--now you put it that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same, I shouldn't have expected a young girl like you to see
it so just yet. How is it you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) maintained a hesitating silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Tess, tell me in confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) meant what were the aspects of things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and
replied shyly--

<p/>``The trees have inquisitive eyes, haven't they?--that is, seem as
if they had. And the river says,--``Why do ye trouble me with your
looks?'' And you seem to see numbers of to-morrows just all in a
line, the first of them the biggest and clearest, the others getting
smaller and smaller as they stand farther away; but they all seem
very fierce and cruel and as if they said, ``I'm coming! Beware of
me! Beware of me!<div class="bookquote">'' ... But YOU, sir, can raise up dreams with your
music, and drive all such horrid fancies away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was surprised to find this young woman--who though but a milkmaid
had just that touch of rarity about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) which might make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the
envied of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) housemates--shaping such sad imaginings. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
expressing in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own native phrases--assisted a little by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Sixth
Standard training--feelings which might almost have been called those
of the age--the ache of modernism. The perception arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) less
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) reflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in
great part but the latest fashion in definition--a more accurate
expression, by words in _logy_ and _ism_, of sensations which men and
women have vaguely grasped for centuries.

<p/>Still, it was strange that they should have come to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) while yet so
young; more than strange; it was impressive, interesting, pathetic.
Not guessing the cause, there was nothing to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) that
experience is as to intensity, and not as to duration. Tess's
passing corporeal blight had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mental harvest.

<p/>Tess, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) part, could not understand why a man of clerical family
and good education, and above physical want, should look upon it as a
mishap to be alive. For the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very
good reason. But how could this admirable and poetic man ever have
descended into the Valley of Humiliation, have felt with the man of
Uz--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) herself had felt two or three years ago--<div class="bookquote">``My soul chooseth
strangling and death rather than my life. I loathe it; I would not
live alway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was true that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at present out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) class. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew
that was only because, like Peter the Great in a shipwright's yard,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was studying what he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) wanted to know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) did not milk cows because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was obliged to milk cows, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was learning to be a
rich and prosperous dairyman, landowner, agriculturist, and breeder
of cattle. He (<font color='blue'><b>breeder</b></font>) would become an American or Australian Abraham,
commanding like a monarch his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) flocks and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) herds, his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) spotted
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) ring-straked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) men-servants and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) maids. At times,
nevertheless, it did seem unaccountable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that a decidedly
bookish, musical, thinking young man should have chosen deliberately
to be a farmer, and not a clergyman, like his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) father and brothers.

<p/>Thus, neither having the clue to the other's secret, they were
respectively puzzled at what each revealed, and awaited new knowledge
of each other's character and mood without attempting to pry into
each other's history.


<p/>Every day, every hour, brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) one more little stroke of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) nature, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) one more of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). Tess was trying to lead a
repressed life, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) little divined the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own
vitality.

<p/>At first Tess seemed to regard Angel Clare as an intelligence rather
than as a man. As such she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) compared him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with herself; and at every
discovery of the abundance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) illuminations, of the distance
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable, Andean
altitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) became quite dejected, disheartened from all
further effort on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own part whatever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dejection one day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had casually mentioned
something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) about pastoral life in ancient Greece. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was
gathering the buds called <div class="bookquote">``lords and ladies''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>from the bank while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, `tis only--about my own self,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, with a frail laugh of
sadness, fitfully beginning to peel <div class="bookquote">``a lady''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>meanwhile. <div class="bookquote">``Just a
sense of what might have been with me! My life looks as if it had
been wasted for want of chances! When I see what you know, what you
have read, and seen, and thought, I feel what a nothing I am! I'm
like the poor Queen of Sheba who lived in the Bible. There is no
more spirit in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless my soul, don't go troubling about that! Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said with
some enthusiasm, <div class="bookquote">``I should be only too glad, my dear Tess, to help
you to anything in the way of history, or any line of reading you
would like to take up--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a lady again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>interrupted she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), holding out the bud she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
peeled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant that there are always more ladies than lords when you come
to peel them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind about the lords and ladies. Would you like to take up
any course of study--history, for example?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I feel I don't want to know anything more about it than I
know already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because what's the use of learning that I am one of a long row
only--finding out that there is set down in some old book somebody
just like me, and to know that I shall only act her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) part; making me
sad, that's all. The best is not to remember that your nature and
your past doings have been just like thousands' and thousands', and
that your coming life and doings 'll be like thousands's and
thousands'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, really, then, you don't want to learn anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind learning why--why the sun do shine on the just and
the unjust alike,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered, with a slight quaver in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``But that's what books will not tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess, fie for such bitterness!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke with a
conventional sense of duty only, for that sort of wondering had not
been unknown to himself in bygone days. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at the
unpracticed mouth and lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that such a daughter of the
soil could only have caught up the sentiment by rote. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went on
peeling the lords and ladies till Clare, regarding for a moment the
wave-like curl of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lashes as they dropped with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bent gaze on
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) soft cheek, lingeringly went away. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) stood
awhile, thoughtfully peeling the last bud; and then, awakening
from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) reverie, flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility
impatiently on the ground, in an ebullition of displeasure with
herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) _niaiserie_, and with a quickening warmth in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
heart of hearts.

<p/>How stupid he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) must think her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)! In an access of hunger for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) good
opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bethought herself of what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had latterly endeavoured to
forget, so unpleasant had been its issues--the identity of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) family
with that of the knightly d``Urbervilles. Barren attribute as it was,
disastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), perhaps
Mr Clare, as a gentleman and a student of history, would respect
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sufficiently to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) childish conduct with the lords and
ladies if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knew that those Purbeck-marble and alabaster people in
Kingsbere Church really represented her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own lineal forefathers; that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was no spurious d``Urberville, compounded of money and ambition
like those at Trantridge, but true d``Urberville to the bone.

<p/>But, before venturing to make the revelation, dubious Tess indirectly
sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon Mr Clare, by
asking the former if Mr Clare had any great respect for old county
families when they had lost all their money and land.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>said the dairyman emphatically, ``is one of the most
rebellest rozums you ever knowed--not a bit like the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
family; and if there's one thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) do hate more than another
`tis the notion of what's called a' old family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) says that it
stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in
past days, and can't have anything left in 'em now. There's the
Billets and the Drenkhards and the Greys and the St Quintins and
the Hardys and the Goulds, who used to own the lands for miles down
this valley; you could buy 'em all up now for an old song a`most.
Why, our little Retty Priddle here, you know, is one of the
Paridelles--the old family that used to own lots o' the lands out by
King's Hintock, now owned by the Earl o' Wessex, afore even he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) was heard of. Well, Mr Clare found this out, and spoke quite
scornful to the poor girl for days. ``Ah!<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) says to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), `you'll
never make a good dairymaid! All your skill was used up ages ago
in Palestine, and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git
strength for more deeds!''  (<font color='red'><b>A boy</b></font>)</div>A boy came here t`other day asking for
a job, and said his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name was Matt, and when we asked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) surname
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d never heard that 'a had any surname, and when we asked
why, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) supposed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) folks hadn't been `stablished long
enough. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! you're the very boy I want!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>says Mr Clare, jumping
up and shaking hands wi'en; <div class="bookquote">``I've great hopes of you;' and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
half-a-crown. O no! he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can't stomach old families!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>After hearing this caricature of Clare's opinion poor Tess was glad
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not said a word in a weak moment about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) family--even
though it was so unusually old almost to have gone round the circle
and become a new one. Besides, another diary-girl was as good as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), it seemed, in that respect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tongue about the
d``Urberville vault and the Knight of the Conqueror whose name she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
bore. The insight afforded into Clare's character suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
that it was largely owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) supposed untraditional newness that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had won interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes.



<p/>XX


<p/>The season developed and matured. Another year's instalment of
flowers, leaves, nightingales, thrushes, finches, and such ephemeral
creatures, took up their positions where only a year ago others had
stood in their place when these were nothing more than germs and
inorganic particles. Rays from the sunrise drew forth the buds and
stretched them into long stalks, lifted up sap in noiseless streams,
opened petals, and sucked out scents in invisible jets and
breathings.

<p/>Dairyman Crick's household of maids and men lived on comfortably,
placidly, even merrily. Their position was perhaps the happiest of
all positions in the social scale, being above the line at which
neediness ends, and below the line at which the _convenances_ begin
to cramp natural feelings, and the stress of threadbare modishness
makes too little of enough.

<p/>Thus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems to be the one
thing aimed at out of doors. Tess and Clare unconsciously studied
each other, ever balanced on the edge of a passion, yet apparently
keeping out of it. All the while they were converging, under an
irresistible law, as surely as two streams in one vale.

<p/>Tess had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) recent life been so happy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was now,
possibly never would be so happy again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, for one thing,
physically and mentally suited among these new surroundings. The
sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of
its sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil. Moreover she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and
Clare also, stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection
and love; where no profundities have been reached; no reflections
have set in, awkwardly inquiring, <div class="bookquote">``Whither does this new current tend
to carry me? What does it mean to my future? How does it stand
towards my past?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess was the merest stray phenomenon to Angel Clare as yet--a rosy,
warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of
persistence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) consciousness. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mind to be
occupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), deeming his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) preoccupation to be no more than a
philosopher's regard of an exceedingly novel, fresh, and interesting
specimen of womankind.

<p/>They met continually; they could not help it. They met daily in that
strange and solemn interval, the twilight of the morning, in the
violet or pink dawn; for it was necessary to rise early, so very
early, here. Milking was done betimes; and before the milking came
the skimming, which began at a little past three. It usually fell
to the lot of some one or other of them to wake the rest, the first
being aroused by an alarm-clock; and, as Tess was the latest arrival,
and they soon discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could be depended upon not to sleep
though the alarm as others did, this task was thrust most frequently
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). No sooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed,
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) room and ran to the dairyman's door; then up the
ladder to Angel's, calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) in a loud whisper; then woke her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
fellow-milkmaids. By the time that Tess was dressed Clare was
downstairs and out in the humid air. The remaining maids and the
dairyman usually gave themselves another turn on the pillow, and did
not appear till a quarter of an hour later.

<p/>The gray half-tones of daybreak are not the gray half-tones of the
day's close, though the degree of their shade may be the same. In
the twilight of the morning, light seems active, darkness passive;
in the twilight of evening it is the darkness which is active and
crescent, and the light which is the drowsy reverse.

<p/>Being so often--possibly not always by chance--the first two persons
to get up at the dairy-house, they seemed to themselves the first
persons up of all the world. In these early days of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) residence
here Tess did not skim, but went out of doors at once after rising,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was generally awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). The spectral, half-compounded,
aqueous light which pervaded the open mead impressed them with
a feeling of isolation, as if they were Adam and Eve. At this
dim inceptive stage of the day Tess seemed to Clare to exhibit a
dignified largeness both of disposition and physique, an almost
regnant power, possibly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knew that at that preternatural
time hardly any woman so well endowed in person as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was likely to
be walking in the open air within the boundaries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) horizon; very
few in all England. Fair women are usually asleep at mid-summer
dawns. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was close at hand, and the rest were nowhere.

<p/>The mixed, singular, luminous gloom in which they walked along
together to the spot where the cows lay often made him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) think of the
Resurrection hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) little thought that the Magdalen might be
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) side. Whilst all the landscape was in neutral shade his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
companion's face, which was the focus of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes, rising above the
mist stratum, seemed to have a sort of phosphorescence upon it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
looked ghostly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were merely a soul at large. In reality
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, without appearing to do so, had caught the cold gleam of
day from the north-east; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own face, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not think of
it, wore the same aspect to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>It was then, as has been said, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) most deeply.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was no longer the milkmaid, but a visionary essence of woman--a
whole sex condensed into one typical form. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Artemis,
Demeter, and other fanciful names half teasingly, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not
like because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not understand them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call me Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would say askance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did.

<p/>Then it would grow lighter, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features would become simply
feminine; they had changed from those of a divinity who could confer
bliss to those of a being who craved it.

<p/>At these non-human hours they could get quite close to the waterfowl.
Herons came, with a great bold noise as of opening doors and
shutters, out of the boughs of a plantation which they frequented at
the side of the mead; or, if already on the spot, hardily maintained
their standing in the water as the pair walked by, watching them by
moving their heads round in a slow, horizontal, passionless wheel,
like the turn of puppets by clockwork.

<p/>They could then see the faint summer fogs in layers, woolly, level,
and apparently no thicker than counterpanes, spread about the meadows
in detached remnants of small extent. On the gray moisture of the
grass were marks where the cows had lain through the night--dark-green
islands of dry herbage the size of their carcasses, in the general
sea of dew. From each island proceeded a serpentine trail, by which
the cow had rambled away to feed after getting up, at the end of
which trail they found her (<font color='blue'><b>puppets</b></font>); the snoring puff from her (<font color='blue'><b>puppets</b></font>) nostrils, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>puppets</b></font>) recognized them, making an intenser little fog of her (<font color='blue'><b>puppets</b></font>) own amid
the prevailing one. Then they drove the animals back to the barton,
or sat down to milk them on the spot, as the case might require.

<p/>Or perhaps the summer fog was more general, and the meadows lay like
a white sea, out of which the scattered trees rose like dangerous
rocks. Birds would soar through it into the upper radiance, and
hang on the wing sunning themselves, or alight on the wet rails
subdividing the mead, which now shone like glass rods. Minute
diamonds of moisture from the mist hung, too, upon Tess's eyelashes,
and drops upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hair, like seed pearls. When the day grew quite
strong and commonplace these dried off her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); moreover, Tess then
lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) strange and ethereal beauty; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) teeth, lips, and eyes
scintillated in the sunbeams and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was again the dazzlingly fair
dairymaid only, who had to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own against the other women of
the world.

<p/>About this time they would hear Dairyman Crick's voice, lecturing the
non-resident milkers for arriving late, and speaking sharply to old
Deborah Fyander for not washing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyander</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For Heaven's sake, pop thy hands under the pump, Deb! Upon my soul,
if the London folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways, they'd
swaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do a`ready; and
that's saying a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The milking progressed, till towards the end Tess and Clare, in
common with the rest, could hear the heavy breakfast table dragged
out from the wall in the kitchen by Mrs Crick, this being the
invariable preliminary to each meal; the same horrible scrape
accompanying its return journey when the table had been cleared.



<p/>XXI


<p/>There was a great stir in the milk-house just after breakfast. The
churn revolved as usual, but the butter would not come. Whenever
this happened the dairy was paralyzed. Squish, squash echoed the
milk in the great cylinder, but never arose the sound they waited
for.

<p/>Dairyman Crick and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) wife, the milkmaids Tess, Marian, Retty
Priddle, Izz Huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also
Mr Clare, Jonathan Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood gazing
hopelessly at the churn; and the boy who kept the horse going outside
put on moon-like eyes to show his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sense of the situation. Even the
melancholy horse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring
despair at each walk round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis years since I went to Conjuror Trendle's son in Egdon--years!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>said the dairyman bitterly. ``And he (<font color='blue'><b>folk</b></font>) was nothing to what his (<font color='blue'><b>folk</b></font>) father
had been. I have said fifty times, if I have said once, that I DON<div class="bookquote">``T
believe in en; though 'a do cast folks' waters very true. But I
shall have to go to 'n if he (<font color='blue'><b>folk</b></font>)'s alive. O yes, I shall have to go to
`n, if this sort of thing continnys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Even Mr Clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman's desperation.

<p/>``Conjuror Fall, t`other side of Casterbridge, that they used to call
``Wide-O', was a very good man when I was a boy,'' said Jonathan Kail.
<div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s rotten as touchwood by now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My grandfather used to go to Conjuror Mynterne, out at Owlscombe,
and a clever man a' were, so I've heard grandf`er say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Crick</b></font>)</div>continued Mr
Crick. <div class="bookquote">``But there's no such genuine folk about nowadays!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Crick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Crick's mind kept nearer to the matter in hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps somebody in the house is in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) said tentatively.
<div class="bookquote">``I've heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it. Why,
Crick--that maid we had years ago, do ye mind, and how the butter
didn't come then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah yes, yes!--but that isn't the rights o`t. It had nothing to do
with the love-making. I can mind all about it--'twas the damage to
the churn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>) turned to Clare.

<p/>``Jack Dollop, a `hore's-bird of a fellow we had here as milker at one
time, sir, courted a young woman over at Mellstock, and deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) had deceived many afore. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) had another sort o' woman to
reckon wi' this time, and it was not the girl herself. One Holy
Thursday of all days in the almanack, we was here as we mid be now,
only there was no churning in hand, when we zid the girl's mother
coming up to the door, wi' a great brass-mounted umbrella in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
hand that would ha' felled an ox, and saying ``Do Jack Dollop work
here?--because I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>)! I have a big bone to pick with he (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>), I
can assure <div class="bookquote">``n!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And some way behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) mother walked Jack's young
woman, crying bitterly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) handkercher. <div class="bookquote">``O Lard, here's a
time!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Dollop</b></font>)</div>said Jack, looking out o' winder at 'em. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll murder me!
Where shall I get--where shall I--? Don't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) where I be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And with that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) scrambled into the churn through the trap-door, and
shut himself inside, just as the young woman's mother busted into
the milk-house. <div class="bookquote">``The villain--where is he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'll claw
his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) face for`n, let me only catch him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hunted about
everywhere, ballyragging Jack by side and by seam, Jack lying
a`most stifled inside the churn, and the poor maid--or young woman
rather--standing at the door crying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes out. I shall never
forget it, never! <div class="bookquote">``Twould have melted a marble stone! But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
couldn't find him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) nowhere at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The dairyman</b></font>)</div><p/>The dairyman paused, and one or two words of comment came from the
listeners.

<p/>Dairyman Crick's stories often seemed to be ended when they were not
really so, and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections
of finality; though old friends knew better. The narrator went on--

<p/>``Well, how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could
never tell, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) was inside that there churn.
Without saying a word she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took hold of the winch -LRB-it was turned by
handpower then-RRB-, and round she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) swung him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>), and Jack began to flop
about inside. ``O Lard! stop the churn! let me out!'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>), popping
out his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) head. ``I shall be churned into a pummy!'' -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) was a cowardly
chap in his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) heart, as such men mostly be-RRB-. ``Not till ye make amends
for ravaging her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) virgin innocence!'' says the old woman. ``Stop the
churn you old witch!'' screams he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>). ``You call me old witch, do ye, you
deceiver!<div class="bookquote">'' says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `when ye ought to ha' been calling me mother-law
these last five months!''  (<font color='red'><b>witch</b></font>)</div>And on went the churn, and Jack's bones
rattled round again. Well, none of us ventured to interfere; and at
last 'a promised to make it right wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I'll be as good as
my word!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. And so it ended that day.''

<p/>While the listeners were smiling their comments there was a
quick movement behind their backs, and they looked round. Tess,
pale-faced, had gone to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How warm `tis to-day!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, almost inaudibly.

<p/>It was warm, and none of them connected her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) withdrawal with the
reminiscences of the dairyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) went forward and opened the door
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), saying with tender raillery--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, maidy''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) frequently, with unconscious irony, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) this
pet name-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``the prettiest milker I've got in my dairy; you mustn't
get so fagged as this at the first breath of summer weather, or we
shall be finely put to for want of `ee by dog-days, shan't we, Mr
Clare?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was faint--and--I think I am better out o' doors,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said
mechanically; and disappeared outside.

<p/>Fortunately for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) the milk in the revolving churn at that moment
changed its squashing for a decided flick-flack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis coming!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Crick</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Crick, and the attention of all was called
off from Tess.

<p/>That fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
remained much depressed all the afternoon. When the evening milking
was done she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not care to be with the rest of them, and went out
of doors, wandering along she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew not whither. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was wretched--O
so wretched--at the perception that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) companions the dairyman's
story had been rather a humorous narration than otherwise; none of
them but herself seemed to see the sorrow of it; to a certainty, not
one knew how cruelly it touched the tender place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) experience.
The evening sun was now ugly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), like a great inflamed wound in
the sky. Only a solitary cracked-voice reed-sparrow greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from
the bushes by the river, in a sad, machine-made tone, resembling that
of a past friend whose friendship she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had outworn.

<p/>In these long June days the milkmaids, and, indeed, most of the
household, went to bed at sunset or sooner, the morning work before
milking being so early and heavy at a time of full pails. Tess
usually accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fellows upstairs. To-night, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was
the first to go to their common chamber; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had dozed when the
other girls came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw them undressing in the orange light
of the vanished sun, which flushed their forms with its colour; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
dozed again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was reawakened by their voices, and quietly
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes towards them.

<p/>Neither of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) three chamber-companions had got into bed. They were
standing in a group, in their nightgowns, barefooted, at the window,
the last red rays of the west still warming their faces and necks and
the walls around them. All were watching somebody in the garden with
deep interest, their three faces close together: a jovial and round
one, a pale one with dark hair, and a fair one whose tresses were
auburn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't push! You can see as well as I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Retty/Retty Priddle</b></font>)</div>said Retty, the
auburn-haired and youngest girl, without removing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes from the
window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis no use for you to be in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) any more than me, Retty
Priddle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said jolly-faced Marian, the eldest, slily. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thoughts
be of other cheeks than thine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Retty/Retty Priddle</b></font>)</div><p/>Retty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp
hair and keenly cut lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't say anything, Izz,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Retty. <div class="bookquote">``For I zid you
kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) shade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``WHAT did you see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>asked Marian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the
shade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was
standing there filling a vat. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mouth against the wall and
kissed the shade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) mouth; I zid her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Izz Huett!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian.

<p/>A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett's cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there was no harm in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) declared, with attempted
coolness. <div class="bookquote">``And if I be in love wi'en, so is Retty, too; and so be
you, Marian, come to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div><p/>Marian's full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What a tale! Ah, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) is again! Dear
eyes--dear face--dear Mr Clare!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There--you've owned it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So have you--so have we all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian, with the dry frankness of
complete indifference to opinion. <div class="bookquote">``It is silly to pretend otherwise
amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks. I would
just marry 'n to-morrow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So would I--and more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>murmured Izz Huett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I too,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered the more timid Retty.

<p/>The listener grew warm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't all marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shan't, either of us; which is worse still,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the eldest.
<div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They all three blew him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) a silent kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Retty/Retty Priddle</b></font>)</div>asked Retty quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) likes Tess Durbeyfield best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)
voice. <div class="bookquote">``I have watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) every day, and have found it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a reflective silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) don't care anything for `n?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>at length breathed Retty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I sometimes think that too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how silly all this is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz Huett impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) won't marry any one of us, or Tess either--a gentleman's son,
who's going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad! More likely
to ask us to come wi'en as farm-hands at so much a year!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div><p/>One sighed, and another sighed, and Marian's plump figure sighed
biggest of all. Somebody in bed hard by sighed too. Tears came into
the eyes of Retty Priddle, the pretty red-haired youngest--the last
bud of the Paridelles, so important in the county annals. They
watched silently a little longer, their three faces still close
together as before, and the triple hues of their hair mingling. But
the unconscious Mr Clare had gone indoors, and they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) no more;
and, the shades beginning to deepen, they crept into their beds.
In a few minutes they heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ascend the ladder to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own room.
Marian was soon snoring, but Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for
a long time. Retty Priddle cried herself to sleep.

<p/>The deeper-passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then. This
conversation was another of the bitter pills she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been obliged to
swallow that day. Scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
breast. For that matter she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew herself to have the preference.
Being more finely formed, better educated, and, though the youngest
except Retty, more woman than either, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perceived that only the
slightest ordinary care was necessary for holding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own in Angel
Clare's heart against these her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) candid friends. But the grave
question was, ought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to do this? There was, to be sure, hardly a
ghost of a chance for either of them, in a serious sense; but there
was, or had been, a chance of one or the other inspiring him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) with a
passing fancy for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and enjoying the pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) attentions
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) stayed here. Such unequal attachments had led to marriage;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had heard from Mrs Crick that Mr Clare had one day asked, in
a laughing way, what would be the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) marrying a fine lady,
and all the while ten thousand acres of Colonial pasture to feed,
and cattle to rear, and corn to reap. A farm-woman would be the
only sensible kind of wife for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). But whether Mr Clare had spoken
seriously or not, why should she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), who could never conscientiously
allow any man to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now, and who had religiously determined
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never would be tempted to do so, draw off Mr Clare's
attention from other women, for the brief happiness of sunning
herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes while he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) remained at Talbothays?



<p/>XXII


<p/>They came downstairs yawning next morning; but skimming and milking
were proceeded with as usual, and they went indoors to breakfast.
Dairyman Crick was discovered stamping about the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) had
received a letter, in which a customer had complained that the butter
had a twang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And begad, so 't have!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>said the dairyman, who held in his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) left hand
a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--taste for
yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Several of them gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>); and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted,
also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and
last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table.
There certainly was a twang.

<p/>The dairyman, who had thrown himself into abstraction to better
realize the taste, and so divine the particular species of noxious
weed to which it appertained, suddenly exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis garlic! and I thought there wasn't a blade left in that mead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The dairyman</b></font>)</div><p/>Then all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead, into which
a few of the cows had been admitted of late, had, in years gone by,
spoilt the butter in the same way. The dairyman had not recognized
the taste at that time, and thought the butter bewitched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must overhaul that mead,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) resumed; <div class="bookquote">``this mustn't continny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All having armed themselves with old pointed knives, they went out
together. As the inimical plant could only be present in very
microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation, to
find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich
grass before them. However, they formed themselves into line, all
assisting, owing to the importance of the search; the dairyman at
the upper end with Mr Clare, who had volunteered to help; then
Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and
the married dairywomen--Beck Knibbs, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) wooly black hair and
rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances, consumptive from the winter damps
of the water-meads--who lived in their respective cottages.

<p/>With eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of
the field, returning a little further down in such a manner that,
when they should have finished, not a single inch of the pasture but
would have fallen under the eye of some one of them. It was a most
tedious business, not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being
discoverable in the whole field; yet such was the herb's pungency
that probably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season
the whole dairy's produce for the day.

<p/>Differing one from another in natures and moods so greatly as they
did, they yet formed, bending, a curiously uniform row--automatic,
noiseless; and an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane
might well have been excused for massing them as <div class="bookquote">``Hodge'' (<font color='red'><b>an observer</b></font>)</div>. As they
crept along, stooping low to discern the plant, a soft yellow gleam
was reflected from the buttercups into their shaded faces, giving
them an elfish, moonlit aspect, though the sun was pouring upon their
backs in all the strength of noon.

<p/>Angel Clare, who communistically stuck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) rule of taking part
with the rest in everything, glanced up now and then. It was not,
of course, by accident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) walked next to Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) replied demurely.

<p/>As they had been discussing a score of personal matters only
half-an-hour before, the introductory style seemed a little
superfluous. But they got no further in speech just then. They
crept and crept, the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) petticoat just touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) gaiter,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) elbow sometimes brushing hers. At last the dairyman, who
came next, could stand it no longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul and body, this here stooping do fairly make my back
open and shut!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) exclaimed, straightening himself slowly with an
excruciated look till quite upright. <div class="bookquote">``And you, maidy Tess, you
wasn't well a day or two ago--this will make your head ache finely!
Don't do any more, if you feel fainty; leave the rest to finish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dairyman Crick/Crick</b></font>)</div><p/>Dairyman Crick withdrew, and Tess dropped behind. Mr Clare also
stepped out of line, and began privateering about for the weed. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) near her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) very tension at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had heard the
night before made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) the first to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't they look pretty?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Izzy Huett and Retty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess had moodily decided that either of these maidens would make a
good farmer's wife, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ought to recommend them, and obscure
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own wretched charms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty? Well, yes--they are pretty girls--fresh looking. I have
often thought so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Though, poor dears, prettiness won't last long!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, unfortunately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are excellent dairywomen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: though not better than you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They skim better than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare remained observing them--not without their observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Izzy</b></font>) is colouring up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>continued Tess heroically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Retty Priddle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Why it that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Izzy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Self-sacrificing as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mood might be, Tess could not well go further
and cry, <div class="bookquote">``Marry one of them, if you really do want a dairywoman and
not a lady; and don't think of marrying me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) followed Dairyman
Crick, and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that Clare
remained behind.

<p/>From this day she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) forced herself to take pains to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)--never
allowing herself, as formerly, to remain long in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) company, even if
their juxtaposition were purely accidental. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gave the other three
every chance.

<p/>Tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that
Angel Clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) keeping, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) perception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) care to avoid compromising the happiness of
either in the least degree bred a tender respect in Tess for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
deemed, rightly or wrongly, the self-controlling sense of duty shown
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), a quality which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had never expected to find in one of the
opposite sex, and in the absence of which more than one of the simple
hearts who were his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) house-mates might have gone weeping on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
pilgrimage.



<p/>XXIII


<p/>The hot weather of July had crept upon them unawares, and the
atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the
dairy-folk, the cows, and the trees. Hot steaming rains fell
frequently, making the grass where the cows fed yet more rank, and
hindering the late hay-making in the other meads.

<p/>It was Sunday morning; the milking was done; the outdoor milkers
had gone home. Tess and the other three were dressing themselves
rapidly, the whole bevy having agreed to go together to Mellstock
Church, which lay some three or four miles distant from the
dairy-house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had now been two months at Talbothays, and this
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) first excursion.

<p/>All the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed
down upon the meads, and washed some of the hay into the river; but
this morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the
deluge, and the air was balmy and clear.

<p/>The crooked lane leading from their own parish to Mellstock ran along
the lowest levels in a portion of its length, and when the girls
reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the
rain had been to flood the lane over-shoe to a distance of some fifty
yards. This would have been no serious hindrance on a week-day; they
would have clicked through it in their high pattens and boots quite
unconcerned; but on this day of vanity, this Sun's-day, when flesh
went forth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting
business with spiritual things; on this occasion for wearing their
white stockings and thin shoes, and their pink, white, and lilac
gowns, on which every mud spot would be visible, the pool was an
awkward impediment. They could hear the church-bell calling--as yet
nearly a mile off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would have expected such a rise in the river in summer-time!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian, from the top of the roadside bank on which they had
climbed, and were maintaining a precarious footing in the hope of
creeping along its slope till they were past the pool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't get there anyhow, without walking right through it, or else
going round the Turnpike way; and that would make us so very late!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Retty/Retty Priddle</b></font>)</div>said Retty, pausing hopelessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I do colour up so hot, walking into church late, and all the
people staring round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian, <div class="bookquote">``that I hardly cool down again
till we get into the That-it-may-please-Thees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div><p/>While they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round
the bend of the road, and presently appeared Angel Clare, advancing
along the lane towards them through the water.

<p/>Four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) aspect was probably as un-Sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic
parson's son often presented; his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) attire being his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dairy clothes,
long wading boots, a cabbage-leaf inside his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hat to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) head
cool, with a thistle-spud to finish him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) off. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>)'s not going to
church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) was!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>murmured Tess.

<p/>Angel, in fact, rightly or wrongly -LRB-to adopt the safe phrase of
evasive controversialists-RRB-, preferred sermons in stones to sermons in
churches and chapels on fine summer days. This morning, moreover,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had gone out to see if the damage to the hay by the flood was
considerable or not. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) walk he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) observed the girls from a long
distance, though they had been so occupied with their difficulties of
passage as not to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) knew that the water had risen at
that spot, and that it would quite check their progress. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had
hastened on, with a dim idea of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) could help them--one of them
in particular.

<p/>The rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed quartet looked so charming in their
light summer attire, clinging to the roadside bank like pigeons on a
roof-slope, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) stopped a moment to regard them before coming
close. Their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable
flies and butterflies which, unable to escape, remained caged in
the transparent tissue as in an aviary. Angel's eye at last fell
upon Tess, the hindmost of the four; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), being full of suppressed
laughter at their dilemma, could not help meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) glance
radiantly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) came beneath them in the water, which did not rise over his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) long
boots; and stood looking at the entrapped flies and butterflies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you trying to get to church?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said to Marian, who was in
front, including the next two in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) remark, but avoiding Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; and `tis getting late; and my colour do come up so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll carry you through the pool--every Jill of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The whole four flushed as if one heart beat through them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you can't, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the only way for you to get past. Stand still. Nonsense--you
are not too heavy! I'd carry you all four together. Now, Marian,
attend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``and put your arms round my shoulders, so.
Now! Hold on. That's well done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Marian had lowered herself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) arm and shoulder as directed, and
Angel strode off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) slim figure, as viewed from behind,
looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers.
They disappeared round the curve of the road, and only his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) sousing
footsteps and the top ribbon of Marian's bonnet told where they were.
In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) reappeared. Izz Huett was the next in order upon
the bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) murmured, and they could hear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) lips were
dry with emotion. <div class="bookquote">``And I have to put my arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) neck and look
into his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) face as Marian did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a time for everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>continued Izz, unheeding. <div class="bookquote">``A time
to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now
going to be mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie--it is Scripture, Izz!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz, <div class="bookquote">``I've always a' ear at church for pretty verses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div><p/>Angel Clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a
commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) quietly and
dreamily lowered herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) arms, and Angel methodically
marched off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was heard returning for the third time
Retty's throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) went
up to the red-haired girl, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) glanced at
Tess. His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) lips could not have pronounced more plainly, <div class="bookquote">``It will soon
be you and I.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comprehension appeared in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not
help it. There was an understanding between them.

<p/>Poor little Retty, though by far the lightest weight, was the most
troublesome of Clare's burdens. Marian had been like a sack of meal,
a dead weight of plumpness under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) has literally staggered.
Izz had ridden sensibly and calmly. Retty was a bunch of hysterics.

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) got through with the disquieted creature, deposited her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>),
and returned. Tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a
group, standing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) had placed them on the next rising ground. It
was now her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was embarrassed to discover that excitement at
the proximity of Mr Clare's breath and eyes, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had contemned
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) companions, was intensified in herself; and as if fearful of
betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) secret, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) paltered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) at the last moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be able to clim' along the bank perhaps--I can clim' better
than they. You must be so tired, Mr Clare!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) quickly. And almost before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was aware,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arms and resting against his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three Leahs to get one Rachel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are better women than I,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) replied, magnanimously sticking
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) resolve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) grow warm at this; and they went some steps in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I am not too heavy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no. You should lift Marian! Such a lump. You are like an
undulating billow warmed by the sun. And all this fluff of muslin
about you is the froth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very pretty--if I seem like that to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know that I have undergone three-quarters of this labour
entirely for the sake of the fourth quarter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not expect such an event to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I... The water came up so sudden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>That the rise in the water was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) to refer to,
the state of breathing belied. Clare stood still and inclinced his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
face towards hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Tessy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>The girl's cheeks burned to the breeze, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not look into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) emotion. It reminded Angel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was somewhat
unfairly taking advantage of an accidental position; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) went no
further with it. No definite words of love had crossed their lips
as yet, and suspension at this point was desirable now. However,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) walked slowly, to make the remainder of the distance as long as
possible; but at last they came to the bend, and the rest of their
progress was in full view of the other three. The dry land was
reached, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) down.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see that they had been talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) hastily bade
them farewell, and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road.

<p/>The four moved on together as before, till Marian broke the silence
by saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--in all truth; we have no chance against her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) looked
joylessly at Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the latter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) likes `ee best--the very best! We could see it as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brought
`ee. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would have kissed `ee, if you had encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to do it,
ever so little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>).

<p/>The gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished; and
yet there was no enmity or malice between them. They were generous
young souls; they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where
fatalism is a strong sentiment, and they did not blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>). Such
supplanting was to be.

<p/>Tess's heart ached. There was no concealing from herself the fact
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) loved Angel Clare, perhaps all the more passionately from
knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). There is
contagion in this sentiment, especially among women. And yet that
same hungry nature had fought against this, but too feebly, and the
natural result had followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will never stand in your way, nor in the way of either of you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) declared to Retty that night in the bedroom -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tears running
down-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``I can't help this, my dear! I don't think marrying is in
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mind at all; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were ever to ask me I should refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
as I should refuse any man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! would you? Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said wondering Retty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot be! But I will be plain. Putting myself quite on one
side, I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will choose either of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never expected it--thought of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>moaned Retty. <div class="bookquote">``But O! I
wish I was dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor child, torn by a feeling which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hardly understood, turned
to the other two girls who came upstairs just then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We be friends with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said to them. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks no
more of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) choosing her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) than we do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So the reserve went off, and they were confiding and warm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't seem to care what I do now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian, whose mood was
turned to its lowest bass. <div class="bookquote">``I was going to marry a dairyman at
Stickleford, who's asked me twice; but--my soul--I would put an end
to myself rather'n be his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) wife now! Why don't ye speak, Izz?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To confess, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>murmured Izz, <div class="bookquote">``I made sure to-day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) was
going to kiss me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) held me; and I lay still against his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) breast,
hoping and hoping, and never moved at all. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) did not. I don't
like biding here at Talbothays any longer! I shall go hwome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div><p/>The air of the sleeping-chamber seemed to palpitate with the
hopeless passion of the girls. They writhed feverishly under the
oppressiveness of an emotion thrust on them by cruel Nature's law--an
emotion which they had neither expected nor desired. The incident
of the day had fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their
hearts out, and the torture was almost more than they could endure.
The differences which distinguished them as individuals were
abstracted by this passion, and each was but portion of one organism
called sex. There was so much frankness and so little jealousy
because there was no hope. Each one was a girl of fair common sense,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not delude herself with any vain conceits, or deny her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
love, or give herself airs, in the idea of outshining the others.
The full recognition of the futility of their infatuation, from a
social point of view; its purposeless beginning; its self-bounded
outlook; its lack of everything to justify its existence in the eye
of civilization -LRB-while lacking nothing in the eye of Nature-RRB-; the one
fact that it did exist, ecstasizing them to a killing joy--all this
imparted to them a resignation, a dignity, which a practical and
sordid expectation of winning him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) as a husband would have destroyed.

<p/>They tossed and turned on their little beds, and the cheese-wring
dripped monotonously downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``B' you awake, Tess?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered one, half-an-hour later.

<p/>It was Izz Huett's voice.

<p/>Tess replied in the affirmative, whereupon also Retty and Marian
suddenly flung the bedclothes off them, and sighed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So be we!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) is like--the lady they say his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) family have looked
out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some lady looked out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>gasped Tess, starting. <div class="bookquote">``I have never
heard o' that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes--`tis whispered; a young lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) own rank, chosen by his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)
family; a Doctor of Divinity's daughter near his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) father's parish of
Emminster; he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) don't much care for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), they say. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) is sure to
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had heard so very little of this; yet it was enough to build up
wretched dolorous dreams upon, there in the shade of the night. They
pictured all the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) being won round to consent, of the
wedding preparations, of the bride's happiness, of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) dress and
veil, of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) blissful home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>), when oblivion would have fallen
upon themselves as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) and their love were concerned. Thus
they talked, and ached, and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow
away.

<p/>After this disclosure Tess nourished no further foolish thought that
there lurked any grave and deliberate import in Clare's attentions
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). It was a passing summer love of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face, for love's own
temporary sake--nothing more. And the thorny crown of this sad
conception was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) really did prefer in a cursory way
to the rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature,
cleverer, more beautiful than they, was in the eyes of propriety far
less worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) than the homelier ones whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ignored.



<p/>XXIV


<p/>Amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the Froom Vale, at a
season when the rush of juices could almost be heard below the hiss
of fertilization, it was impossible that the most fanciful love
should not grow passionate. The ready bosoms existing there were
impregnated by their surroundings.

<p/>July passed over their heads, and the Thermidorean weather which came
in its wake seemed an effort on the part of Nature to match the state
of hearts at Talbothays Dairy. The air of the place, so fresh in the
spring and early summer, was stagnant and enervating now. Its heavy
scents weighed upon them, and at mid-day the landscape seemed lying
in a swoon. Ethiopic scorchings browned the upper slopes of the
pastures, but there was still bright green herbage here where the
watercourses purled. And as Clare was oppressed by the outward
heats, so was he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for
the soft and silent Tess.

<p/>The rains having passed, the uplands were dry. The wheels of the
dairyman's spring-cart, as he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) sped home from market, licked up the
pulverized surface of the highway, and were followed by white ribands
of dust, as if they had set a thin powder-train on fire. The cows
jumped wildly over the five-barred barton-gate, maddened by the
gad-fly; Dairyman Crick kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) shirt-sleeves permanently rolled up
from Monday to Saturday; open windows had no effect in ventilation
without open doors, and in the dairy-garden the blackbirds and
thrushes crept about under the currant-bushes, rather in the manner
of quadrupeds than of winged creatures. The flies in the kitchen
were lazy, teasing, and familiar, crawling about in the unwonted
places, on the floors, into drawers, and over the backs of the
milkmaids' hands. Conversations were concerning sunstroke; while
butter-making, and still more butter-keeping, was a despair.

<p/>They milked entirely in the meads for coolness and convenience,
without driving in the cows. During the day the animals obsequiously
followed the shadow of the smallest tree as it moved round the stem
with the diurnal roll; and when the milkers came they could hardly
stand still for the flies.

<p/>On one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to
stand apart from the general herd, behind the corner of a hedge,
among them being Dumpling and Old Pretty, who loved Tess's hands
above those of any other maid. When she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) stool under a
finished cow, Angel Clare, who had been observing her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) for some time,
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would take the aforesaid creatures next. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
silently assented, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) stool at arm's length, and the pail
against her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) knee, went round to where they stood. Soon the sound of
Old Pretty's milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge, and
then Angel felt inclined to go round the corner also, to finish off a
hard-yielding milcher who had strayed there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) being now as capable
of this as the dairyman himself.

<p/>All the men, and some of the women, when milking, dug their foreheads
into the cows and gazed into the pail. But a few--mainly the younger
ones--rested their heads sideways. This was Tess Durbeyfield's
habit, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) temple pressing the milcher's flank, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) eyes fixed on
the far end of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was milking Old Pretty thus, and the sun chancing to be on the
milking-side, it shone flat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) pink-gowned form and her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) white
curtain-bonnet, and upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) profile, rendering it keen as a cameo
cut from the dun background of the cow.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) did not know that Clare had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) round, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sat
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) cow watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>). The stillness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) head and features
was remarkable: she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) might have been in a trance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) eyes open, yet
unseeing. Nothing in the picture moved but Old Pretty's tail and
Tess's pink hands, the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation
only, as if they were obeying a reflex stimulus, like a beating
heart.

<p/>How very lovable her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). Yet there was nothing ethereal
about it; all was real vitality, real warmth, real incarnation. And
it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth that this culminated. Eyes almost as deep and
speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had seen before, and cheeks perhaps as fair; brows as
arched, a chin and throat almost as shapely; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had seen
nothing to equal on the face of the earth. To a young man with the
least fire in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that little upward lift in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) red
top lip was distracting, infatuating, maddening. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had never before
seen a woman's lips and teeth which forced upon his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) mind with such
persistent iteration the old Elizabethan simile of roses filled with
snow. Perfect, he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), as a lover, might have called them off-hand. But
no--they were not perfect. And it was the touch of the imperfect
upon the would-be perfect that gave the sweetness, because it was
that which gave the humanity.

<p/>Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
could reproduce them mentally with ease: and now, as they again
confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), clothed with colour and life, they sent an _aura_
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) flesh, a breeze through his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) nerves, which well nigh produced
a qualm; and actually produced, by some mysterious physiological
process, a prosaic sneeze.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) then became conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would
not show it by any change of position, though the curious dream-like
fixity disappeared, and a close eye might easily have discerned that
the rosiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) face deepened, and then faded till only a tinge
of it was left.

<p/>The influence that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the
sky did not die down. Resolutions, reticences, prudences, fears,
fell back like a defeated battalion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) seat,
and, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a
mind, went quickly towards the desire of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes, and, kneeling down
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arms.

<p/>Tess was taken completely by surprise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) yielded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) embrace
with unreflecting inevitableness. Having seen that it was really her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
lover who had advanced, and no one else, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips parted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
sank upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) momentary joy, with something very like an
ecstatic cry.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
checked himself, for tender conscience' sake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, Tess dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to have asked.
I--did not know what I was doing. I do not mean it as a liberty.
I am devoted to you, Tessy, dearest, in all sincerity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Old Pretty by this time had looked round, puzzled; and seeing two
people crouching under her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) where, by immemorial custom, there should
have been only one, lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hind leg crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) is angry--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) doesn't know what we mean--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)'ll kick over the
milk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Tess, gently striving to free herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes
concerned with the quadruped's actions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart more deeply
concerned with herself and Clare.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) slipped up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seat, and they stood together, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm still
encircling her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Tess's eyes, fixed on distance, began to fill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you cry, my darling?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O--I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw and felt more clearly the position she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was in she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) became
agitated and tried to withdraw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have betrayed my feeling, Tess, at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), with a
curious sigh of desperation, signifying unconsciously that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) heart
had outrun his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) judgement. <div class="bookquote">``That I--love you dearly and truly I need
not say. But I--it shall go no further now--it distresses you--I am
as surprised as you are. You will not think I have presumed upon
your defencelessness--been too quick and unreflecting, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N'--I can't tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to free herself; and in a minute or two the
milking of each was resumed. Nobody had beheld the gravitation of
the two into one; and when the dairyman came round by that screened
nook a few minutes later, there was not a sign to reveal that
the markedly sundered pair were more to each other than mere
acquaintance. Yet in the interval since Crick's last view of them
something had occurred which changed the pivot of the universe for
their two natures; something which, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) known its quality, the
dairyman would have despised, as a practical man; yet which was based
upon a more stubborn and resistless tendency than a whole heap of
so-called practicalities. A veil had been whisked aside; the tract
of each one's outlook was to have a new horizon thenceforward--for a
short time or for a long.


<p/>END OF PHASE THE THIRD





<p/>Phase the Fourth: The Consequence



<p/>XXV


<p/>Clare, restless, went out into the dusk when evening drew on, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) who
had won him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) having retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) chamber.

<p/>The night was as sultry as the day. There was no coolness after dark
unless on the grass. Roads, garden-paths, the house-fronts, the
barton-walls were warm as hearths, and reflected the noontime
temperature into the noctambulist's face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sat on the east gate of the dairy-yard, and knew not what to think
of himself. Feeling had indeed smothered judgement that day.

<p/>Since the sudden embrace, three hours before, the twain had kept
apart. She (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) seemed stilled, almost alarmed, at what had occurred,
while the novelty, unpremeditation, mastery of circumstance
disquieted him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)--palpitating, contemplative being that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet, and
what their mutual bearing should be before third parties
thenceforward.

<p/>Angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) temporary
existence here was to be the merest episode in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) life, soon passed
through and early forgotten; he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had come as to a place from which
as from a screened alcove he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) could calmly view the absorbing world
without, and, apostrophizing it with Walt Whitman--


<p/>Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes,
How curious you are to me!--


<p/>resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew. But behold,
the absorbing scene had been imported hither. What had been the
engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb-show;
while here, in this apparently dim and unimpassioned place, novelty
had volcanically started up, as it had never, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Walt</b></font>), started up
elsewhere.

<p/>Every window of the house being open, Clare could hear across the
yard each trivial sound of the retiring household. The dairy-house,
so humble, so insignificant, so purely to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) a place of constrained
sojourn that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance
to be reconnoitred as an object of any quality whatever in the
landscape; what was it now? The aged and lichened brick gables
breathed forth <div class="bookquote">``Stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The windows smiled, the door coaxed and
beckoned, the creeper blushed confederacy. A personality within
it was so far-reaching in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) influence as to spread into and make
the bricks, mortar, and whole overhanging sky throb with a burning
sensibility. Whose was this mighty personality? A milkmaid's.

<p/>It was amazing, indeed, to find how great a matter the life of the
obscure dairy had become to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). And though new love was to be held
partly responsible for this, it was not solely so. Many besides
Angel have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their
external displacements, but as to their subjective experiences. The
impressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life
than the pachydermatous king. Looking at it thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) found that life
was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere.

<p/>Despite his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man with
a conscience. Tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and
dismiss; but a woman living her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) precious life--a life which, to
herself who endured or enjoyed it, possessed as great a dimension
as the life of the mightiest to himself. Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sensations
the whole world depended to Tess; through her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) existence all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
fellow-creatures existed, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). The universe itself only came into
being for Tess on the particular day in the particular year in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was born.

<p/>This consciousness upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had intruded was the single
opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic
First Cause--her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) all; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) every and only chance. How then should he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as of less consequence than himself; as a pretty trifle
to caress and grow weary of; and not deal in the greatest seriousness
with the affection which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had awakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--so
fervid and so impressionable as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was under her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reserve--in order
that it might not agonize and wreck her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)?

<p/>To encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop
what had begun. Living in such close relations, to meet meant to
fall into endearment; flesh and blood could not resist it; and,
having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) decided to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which
they would be mutually engaged. As yet the harm done was small.

<p/>But it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was driven towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) by every heave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) pulse.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would go and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) friends. It might be possible
to sound them upon this. In less than five months his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) term here
would have ended, and after a few additional months spent upon other
farms he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in
a position to start on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own account. Would not a farmer want a
wife, and should a farmer's wife be a drawing-room wax-figure, or a
woman who understood farming? Notwithstanding the pleasing answer
returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) by the silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) resolved to go his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) journey.

<p/>One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some
maid observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dairyman Crick/Crick</b></font>)</div>said Dairyman Crick. <div class="bookquote">``Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster
to spend a few days wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) kinsfolk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ones</b></font>)</div><p/>For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the
morning went out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song.
But neither girl by word or gesture revealed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blankness. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'s
getting on towards the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) time wi' me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>added the dairyman,
with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal; <div class="bookquote">``and so I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
is beginning to see about his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) plans elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much longer is he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to bide here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>asked Izz Huett, the only
one of the gloom-stricken bevy who could trust her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice with the
question.

<p/>The others waited for the dairyman's answer as if their lives hung
upon it; Retty, with parted lips, gazing on the tablecloth, Marian
with heat added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) redness, Tess throbbing and looking out at
the meads.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I can't mind the exact day without looking at my
memorandum-book,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dairyman Crick/Crick</b></font>)</div>replied Crick, with the same intolerable unconcern.
<div class="bookquote">``And even that may be altered a bit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'ll bide to get a little
practice in the calving out at the straw-yard, for certain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'ll
hang on till the end of the year I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Four months or so of torturing ecstasy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) society--of <div class="bookquote">``pleasure
girdled about with pain'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>. After that the blackness of unutterable
night.


<p/>At this moment of the morning Angel Clare was riding along a narrow
lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father's Vicarage at Emminster, carrying, as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could,
a little basket which contained some black-puddings and a bottle of
mead, sent by Mrs Crick, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) kind respects, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) parents. The
white lane stretched before him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes were upon it; but they
were staring into next year, and not at the lane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>);
ought he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>)? Dared he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>)? What would his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) brothers say? What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) himself say a couple of years
after the event? That would depend upon whether the germs of staunch
comradeship underlay the temporary emotion, or whether it were a
sensuous joy in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) form only, with no substratum of everlastingness.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father's hill-surrounded little town, the Tudor church-tower of
red stone, the clump of trees near the Vicarage, came at last into
view beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) rode down towards the well-known gate.
Casting a glance in the direction of the church before entering his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>)
home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) beheld standing by the vestry-door a group of girls, of
ages between twelve and sixteen, apparently awaiting the arrival of
some other one, who in a moment became visible; a figure somewhat
older than the school-girls, wearing a broad-brimmed hat and
highly-starched cambric morning-gown, with a couple of books in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>)
hand.

<p/>Clare knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not be sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) did not, so as to render it unnecessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) should go
and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>), blameless creature that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) was. An overpowering
reluctance to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) decide that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).
The young lady was Miss Mercy Chant, the only daughter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
father's neighbour and friend, whom it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) parents' quiet hope
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) might wed some day. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was great at Antinomianism and
Bible-classes, and was plainly going to hold a class now. Clare's
mind flew to the impassioned, summer-steeped heathens in the Var
Vale, their rosy faces court-patched with cow-droppings; and to one
the most impassioned of them all.

<p/>It was on the impulse of the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had resolved to trot
over to Emminster, and hence had not written to apprise his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother
and father, aiming, however, to arrive about the breakfast hour,
before they should have gone out to their parish duties. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was
a little late, and they had already sat down to the morning meal.
The group at the table jumped up to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
entered. They were his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father and mother, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) brother the Reverend
Felix--curate at a town in the adjoining county, home for the inside
of a fortnight--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) other brother, the Reverend Cuthbert, the
classical scholar, and Fellow and Dean of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) College, down from
Cambridge for the long vacation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) mother appeared in a cap and
silver spectacles, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) father looked what in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) was--an
earnest, God-fearing man, somewhat gaunt, in years about sixty-five,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) pale face lined with thought and purpose. Over their heads hung
the picture of Angel's sister, the eldest of the family, sixteen
years his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) senior, who had married a missionary and gone out to
Africa.

<p/>Old Mr Clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty
years, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life. A spiritual
descendant in the direct line from Wycliff, Huss, Luther, Calvin; an
Evangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic
simplicity in life and thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raw youth made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence, and admitted
no further reasoning on them thenceforward. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was regarded even by
those of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own date and school of thinking as extreme; while, on
the other hand, those totally opposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were unwillingly won
to admiration for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoroughness, and for the remarkable power he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) energy for
applying them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved Paul of Tarsus, liked St John, hated St
James as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) dared, and regarded with mixed feelings Timothy,
Titus, and Philemon. The New Testament was less a Christiad then a
Pauliad to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philemon</b></font>) intelligence--less an argument than an intoxication.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Philemon</b></font>) creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a
vice, and quite amounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative
philosophy which had cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and
Leopardi. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philemon</b></font>) despised the Canons and Rubric, swore by the Articles,
and deemed himself consistent through the whole category--which in a
way he (<font color='blue'><b>Philemon</b></font>) might have been. One thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Philemon</b></font>) certainly was--sincere.

<p/>To the aesthetic, sensuous, pagan pleasure in natural life and lush
womanhood which his (<font color='blue'><b>Philemon</b></font>) son Angel had lately been experiencing in Var
Vale, his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree, had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) either by inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it. Once
upon a time Angel had been so unlucky as to say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father, in
a moment of irritation, that it might have resulted far better for
mankind if Greece had been the source of the religion of modern
civilization, and not Palestine; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father's grief was of that
blank description which could not realize that there might lurk a
thousandth part of a truth, much less a half truth or a whole truth,
in such a proposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had simply preached austerely at Angel for
some time after. But the kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) heart was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
never resented anything for long, and welcomed his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) son to-day with a
smile which was as candidly sweet as a child's.

<p/>Angel sat down, and the place felt like home; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) did not so much
as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there. Every
time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) returned hither he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was conscious of this divergence,
and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even
more distinctly foreign to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) own than usual. Its transcendental
aspirations--still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of
things, a zenithal paradise, a nadiral hell--were as foreign to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet.
Latterly he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had seen only Life, felt only the great passionate pulse
of existence, unwarped, uncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds
which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to
regulate.

<p/>On their part they saw a great difference in him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>), a growing
divergence from the Angel Clare of former times. It was chiefly a
difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) manner that they noticed just now, particularly
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) brothers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was getting to behave like a farmer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
legs about; the muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) face had grown more expressive; his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
eyes looked as much information as his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) tongue spoke, and more. The
manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner
of the drawing-room young man. A prig would have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
lost culture, and a prude that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become coarse. Such was the
contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and
swains.

<p/>After breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two brothers, non-evangelical,
well-educated, hall-marked young men, correct to their remotest
fibre, such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by
the lathe of a systematic tuition. They were both somewhat
short-sighted, and when it was the custom to wear a single eyeglass
and string they wore a single eyeglass and string; when it was the
custom to wear a double glass they wore a double glass; when it was
the custom to wear spectacles they wore spectacles straightway, all
without reference to the particular variety of defect in their own
vision. When Wordsworth was enthroned they carried pocket copies;
and when Shelley was belittled they allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelley</b></font>) to grow dusty on
their shelves. When Correggio's Holy Families were admired, they
admired Correggio's Holy Families; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelley</b></font>) was decried in favour
of Velasquez, they sedulously followed suit without any personal
objection.

<p/>If these two noticed Angel's growing social ineptness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) noticed
their growing mental limitations. Felix seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) all Church;
Cuthbert all College. His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the
mainsprings of the world to the one; Cambridge to the other. Each
brother candidly recognized that there were a few unimportant score
of millions of outsiders in civilized society, persons who were
neither University men nor churchmen; but they were to be tolerated
rather than reckoned with and respected.

<p/>They were both dutiful and attentive sons, and were regular in their
visits to their parents. Felix, though an offshoot from a far more
recent point in the devolution of theology than his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father, was less
self-sacrificing and disinterested. More tolerant than his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father of
a contradictory opinion, in its aspect as a danger to its holder, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was less ready than his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father to pardon it as a slight to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own
teaching. Cuthbert was, upon the whole, the more liberal-minded,
though, with greater subtlety, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not so much heart.

<p/>As they walked along the hillside Angel's former feeling revived
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)--that whatever their advantages by comparison with himself,
neither saw or set forth life as it really was lived. Perhaps, as
with many men, their opportunities of observation were not so good
as their opportunities of expression. Neither had an adequate
conception of the complicated forces at work outside the smooth and
gentle current in which they and their associates floated. Neither
saw the difference between local truth and universal truth; that what
the inner world said in their clerical and academic hearing was quite
a different thing from what the outer world was thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now, my dear fellow,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Felix</b></font>)</div>Felix was saying, among other things, to his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) youngest brother, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) looked through his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) spectacles at the distant fields with sad
austerity. <div class="bookquote">``And, therefore, we must make the best of it. But I do
entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with
moral ideals. Farming, of course, means roughing it externally; but
high thinking may go with plain living, nevertheless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel. <div class="bookquote">``Was it not proved nineteen hundred
years ago--if I may trespass upon your domain a little? Why should
you think, Felix, that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my
moral ideals?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I fancied, from the tone of your letters and our
conversation--it may be fancy only--that you were somehow losing
intellectual grasp. Hasn't it struck you, Cuthbert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel drily, <div class="bookquote">``we are very good friends, you
know; each of us treading our allotted circles; but if it comes to
intellectual grasp, I think you, as a contented dogmatist, had
better leave mine alone, and inquire what has become of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>They returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed at any time at
which their father's and mother's morning work in the parish usually
concluded. Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last
thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare;
though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to
wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions.

<p/>The walk had made them hungry, Angel in particular, who was now
an outdoor man, accustomed to the profuse _dapes inemptae_ of the
dairyman's somewhat coarsely-laden table. But neither of the old
people had arrived, and it was not till the sons were almost tired of
waiting that their parents entered. The self-denying pair had been
occupied in coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners,
whom they, somewhat inconsistently, tried to keep imprisoned in the
flesh, their own appetites being quite forgotten.

<p/>The family sat down to table, and a frugal meal of cold viands
was deposited before them. Angel looked round for Mrs Crick's
black-puddings, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had directed to be nicely grilled as they
did them at the dairy, and of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father and mother
to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) did
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are looking for the black-puddings, my dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>observed
Clare's mother. <div class="bookquote">``But I am sure you will not mind doing without them
as I am sure your father and I shall not, when you know the reason.
I suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that we should take Mrs Crick's kind present to
the children of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
attacks of delirium tremens; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) agreed that it would be a great
pleasure to them; so we did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel cheerfully, looking round for the mead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I found the mead so extremely alcoholic,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mother,
<div class="bookquote">``that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage, but as valuable
as rum or brandy in an emergency; so I have put it in my
medicine-closet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We never drink spirits at this table, on principle,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>added his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the black-puddings
very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me
directly I return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot, if we did not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>Mr Clare answered lucidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--no; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>)</div>said Cuthbert and Felix both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--`tis an expression they use down at Talbothays,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>replied Angel,
blushing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) parents were right in their practice if
wrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more.



<p/>XXVI


<p/>It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found
opportunity of broaching to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father one or two subjects near his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) brothers on the carpet, studying the little nails in the heels of
their walking boots. When the service was over they went out of the
room with their mother, and Mr Clare and himself were left alone.

<p/>The young man first discussed with the elder his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plans for the
attainment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position as a farmer on an extensive scale--either
in England or in the Colonies. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father then told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
had felt it his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the
purchase or lease of land for him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) some day, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) might not feel
himself unduly slighted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as worldly wealth goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``you will no
doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>This considerateness on old Mr Clare's part led Angel onward to the
other and dearer subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) observed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was
then six-and-twenty, and that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) should start in the farming
business he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would require eyes in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) head to see to all
matters--some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic
labours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) establishment whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was afield. Would it not be
well, therefore, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) to marry?

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then Angel
put the question--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty
hard-working farmer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in
your goings-out and your comings-in. Beyond that, it really matters
little. Such an one can be found; indeed, my earnest-minded friend
and neighbour, Dr Chant--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But ought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not primarily to be able to milk cows, churn good
butter, make immense cheeses; know how to sit hens and turkeys and
rear chickens, to direct a field of labourers in an emergency, and
estimate the value of sheep and calves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; a farmer's wife; yes, certainly. It would be desirable.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>Mr
Clare, the elder, had plainly never thought of these points before.
<div class="bookquote">``I was going to add,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that for a pure and saintly woman you
will not find one more to your true advantage, and certainly not more
to your mother's mind and my own, than your friend Mercy, whom you
used to show a certain interest in. It is true that my neighbour
Chant's daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger
clergy round about us for decorating the Communion-table--altar, as I
was shocked to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) call it one day--with flowers and other stuff
on festival occasions. But her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, who is quite as opposed to
such flummery as I, says that can be cured. It is a mere girlish
outbreak which, I am sure, will not be permanent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; Mercy is good and devout, I know. But, father, don't you
think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant,
but one who, in place of that lady's ecclesiastical accomplishments,
understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself,
would suit me infinitely better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) conviction that a knowledge of a farmer's
wife's duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the
impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father's feelings and to
advance the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) heart at the same time, grew specious.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said that fate or Providence had thrown in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) way a woman who
possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist,
and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would not say
whether or not she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had attached herself to the sound Low Church
School of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would probably be open to conviction
on that point; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a regular church-goer of simple faith;
honest-hearted, receptive, intelligent, graceful to a degree, chaste
as a vestal, and, in personal appearance, exceptionally beautiful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of a family such as you would care to marry into--a lady, in
short?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>church-goer</b></font>) startled mother, who had come softly into the study
during the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not what in common parlance is called a lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel,
unflinchingly, <div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a cottager's daughter, as I am proud to
say. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) IS a lady, nevertheless--in feeling and nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy Chant is of a very good family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh!--what's the advantage of that, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``How is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I
have, and shall have to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy is accomplished. And accomplishments have their charm,''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mother, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) silver spectacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to external accomplishments, what will be the use of them in the
life I am going to lead?--while as to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reading, I can take that
in hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll be apt pupil enough, as you would say if you knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s brim full of poetry--actualized poetry, if I may use the
expression. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) LIVES what paper-poets only write... And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is an
unimpeachable Christian, I am sure; perhaps of the very tribe, genus,
and species you desire to propagate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Angel, you are mocking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, I beg pardon. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) really does attend Church almost
every Sunday morning, and is a good Christian girl, I am sure you
will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality,
and feel that I may do worse than choose her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>Angel waxed quite
earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) beloved Tess which
-LRB-never dreaming that it might stand him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) in such good stead-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had
been prone to slight when observing it practised by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) and the other
milkmaids, because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially
naturalistic.

<p/>In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right
whatever to the title he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and
Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) at least was sound in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) views; especially as the conjunction of
the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never
would have made orthodoxy a condition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) choice. They said
finally that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would
not object to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) felt that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) parents
were, there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as
middle-class people, which it would require some tact to overcome.
For though legally at liberty to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) chose, and though their
daughter-in-law's qualifications could make no practical difference
to their lives, in the probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) living far away from them,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wished for affection's sake not to wound their sentiment in the
most important decision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) life.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in
Tess's life as if they were vital features. It was for herself that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) loved Tess; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soul, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) substance--not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) skill
in the dairy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) aptness as his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) scholar, and certainly not for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) simple formal faith-professions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) unsophisticated open-air
existence required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) held that education had as yet but little affected the
beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends. It
was probable that, in the lapse of ages, improved systems of moral
and intellectual training would appreciably, perhaps considerably,
elevate the involuntary and even the unconscious instincts of human
nature; but up to the present day, culture, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) could see,
might be said to have affected only the mental epiderm of those
lives which had been brought under its influence. This belief was
confirmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) experience of women, which, having latterly been
extended from the cultivated middle-class into the rural community,
had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) how much less was the intrinsic difference between the
good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and wise woman
of another social stratum, than between the good and bad, the wise
and the foolish, of the same stratum or class.

<p/>It was the morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) departure. His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) brothers had already left
the Vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north, whence one
was to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) college, and the other to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) curacy. Angel
might have accompanied them, but preferred to rejoin his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) sweetheart
at Talbothays. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would have been an awkward member of the
party; for, though the most appreciative humanist, the most ideal
religionist, even the best-versed Christologist of the three, there
was alienation in the standing consciousness that his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) squareness
would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). To
neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) ventured to mention Tess.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mother made him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) sandwiches, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>),
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) own mare, a little way along the road. Having fairly well
advanced his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) own affairs, Angel listened in a willing silence, as
they jogged on together through the shady lanes, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father's
account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) parish difficulties, and the coldness of brother
clergymen whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) loved, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) strict interpretations of
the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious
Calvinistic doctrine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pernicious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) proceeded to
recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had been
the instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and
well-to-do; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) also candidly admitted many failures.

<p/>As an instance of the latter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mentioned the case of a young
upstart squire named d``Urberville, living some forty miles off, in
the neighbourhood of Trantridge.

<p/>``Not one of the ancient d``Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places?''
asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``That curiously historic worn-out family with its
ghostly legend of the coach-and-four?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``O no. The original d<div class="bookquote">``Urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty
or eighty years ago--at least, I believe so. This seems to be a
new family which had taken the name; for the credit of the former
knightly line I hope they are spurious, I'm sure. But it is odd
to hear you express interest in old families. I thought you set less
store by them even than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You misapprehend me, father; you often do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Angel with a
little impatience. <div class="bookquote">``Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of
their being old. Some of the wise even among themselves `exclaim
against their own succession,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as Hamlet puts it; but lyrically,
dramatically, and even historically, I am tenderly attached to them.''

<p/>This distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too
subtle for Mr Clare the elder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went on with the story he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had
been about to relate; which was that after the death of the senior
so-called d``Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable
passions, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a blind mother, whose condition should have
made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know better. A knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) career having come to
the ears of Mr Clare, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was in that part of the country
preaching missionary sermons, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) boldly took occasion to speak to
the delinquent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) spiritual state. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was a stranger,
occupying another's pulpit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had felt this to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) duty, and
took for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) text the words from St Luke: <div class="bookquote">``Thou fool, this night thy
soul shall be required of thee!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The young man much resented this
directness of attack, and in the war of words which followed when
they met he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not scruple publicly to insult Mr Clare, without
respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) gray hairs.

<p/>Angel flushed with distress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said sadly, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would not expose yourself
to such gratuitous pain from scoundrels!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pain?''  (<font color='red'><b>father face</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father, his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) rugged face shining in the ardour of
self-abnegation. ``The only pain to me was pain on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) account, poor,
foolish young man. Do you suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) incensed words could give
me any pain, or even his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blows? ``Being reviled we bless; being
persecuted we suffer it; being defamed we entreat; we are made as the
filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this
day.<div class="bookquote">'' Those ancient and noble words to the Corinthians are strictly
true at this present hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not blows, father? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not proceed to blows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not. Though I have borne blows from men in a mad state
of intoxication.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A dozen times, my boy. What then? I have saved them from the guilt
of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby; and they have lived
to thank me, and praise God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May this young man do the same!''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel fervently. <div class="bookquote">``But I fear
otherwise, from what you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll hope, nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Mr Clare. <div class="bookquote">``And I continue to pray
for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though on this side of the grave we shall probably never
meet again. But, after all, one of those poor words of mine may
spring up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart as a good seed some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, as always, Clare's father was sanguine as a child; and though
the younger could not accept his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) parent's narrow dogma, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) revered
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) practice and recognized the hero under the pietist. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
revered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's practice even more now than ever, seeing that,
in the question of making Tessy his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father had not once
thought of inquiring whether she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were well provided or penniless.
The same unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel's getting
a living as a farmer, and would probably keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) brothers in the
position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel
admired it none the less. Indeed, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) own heterodoxy, Angel
often felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was nearer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father on the human side than
was either of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) brethren.



<p/>XXVII


<p/>An up-hill and down-hill ride of twenty-odd miles through a garish
mid-day atmosphere brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) in the afternoon to a detached knoll
a mile or two west of Talbothays, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) again looked into that
green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or
Froom. Immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) began to descend from the upland to the fat
alluvial soil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume
of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein
a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals,
the very bees and butterflies drowsy. Clare was now so familiar with
the spot that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knew the individual cows by their names when, a long
distance off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) saw them dotted about the meads. It was with a
sense of luxury that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) power of viewing life here
from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) student-days; and, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) parents, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not
help being aware that to come here, as now, after an experience of
home-life, affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) like throwing off splints and bandages; even
the one customary curb on the humours of English rural societies
being absent in this place, Talbothays having no resident landlord.

<p/>Not a human being was out of doors at the dairy. The denizens were
all enjoying the usual afternoon nap of an hour or so which the
exceedingly early hours kept in summer-time rendered a necessity.
At the door the wood-hooped pails, sodden and bleached by infinite
scrubbings, hung like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb
of an oak fixed there for that purpose; all of them ready and dry
for the evening milking. Angel entered, and went through the silent
passages of the house to the back quarters, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) listened for a
moment. Sustained snores came from the cart-house, where some of
the men were lying down; the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs
arose from the still further distance. The large-leaved rhubarb and
cabbage plants slept too, their broad limp surfaces hanging in the
sun like half-closed umbrellas.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) unbridled and fed his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) horse, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) re-entered the house the
clock struck three. Three was the afternoon skimming-hour; and, with
the stroke, Clare heard the creaking of the floor-boards above, and
then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs. It was Tess's,
who in another moment came down before his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) enter, and hardly realized his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) presence there.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was yawning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) saw the red interior of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth as if it
had been a snake's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had stretched one arm so high above her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
coiled-up cable of hair that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could see its satin delicacy above
the sunburn; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face was flushed with sleep, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyelids hung
heavy over their pupils. The brim-fulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) nature breathed
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). It was a moment when a woman's soul is more incarnate than
at any other time; when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself
flesh; and sex takes the outside place in the presentation.

<p/>Then those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness,
before the remainder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face was well awake. With an oddly
compounded look of gladness, shyness, and surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``O
Mr Clare! How you frightened me--I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There had not at first been time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to think of the changed
relations which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) declaration had introduced; but the full sense of
the matter rose up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) encountered Clare's tender
look as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) stepped forward to the bottom stair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, darling Tessy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) whispered, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) face to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) flushed cheek. <div class="bookquote">``Don't, for Heaven's sake, Mister me
any more. I have hastened back so soon because of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's excitable heart beat against his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) by way of reply; and there
they stood upon the red-brick floor of the entry, the sun slanting in
by the window upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) back, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tightly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) breast;
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) inclining face, upon the blue veins of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) temple, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
naked arm, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) neck, and into the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hair. Having
been lying down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) clothes she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was warm as a sunned cat. At
first she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would not look straight up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes soon
lifted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) plumbed the deepness of the ever-varying pupils, with
their radiating fibrils of blue, and black, and gray, and violet,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) as Eve at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) second waking might have
regarded Adam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got to go a-skimming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pleaded, <div class="bookquote">``and I have on'y old Deb to
help me to-day. Mrs Crick is gone to market with Mr Crick, and Retty
is not well, and the others are gone out somewhere, and won't be home
till milking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As they retreated to the milk-house Deborah Fyander appeared on the
stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come back, Deborah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Mr Clare, upwards. <div class="bookquote">``So I can help
Tess with the skimming; and, as you are very tired, I am sure, you
needn't come down till milking-time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Possibly the Talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that
afternoon. Tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared
as having light and shade and position, but no particular outline.
Every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) held the skimmer under the pump to cool it for the
work her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand trembled, the ardour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) affection being so palpable
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) side, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had done running
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) forefinger round the leads to cut off the cream-edge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) cleaned
it in nature's way; for the unconstrained manners of Talbothays dairy
came convenient now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may as well say it now as later, dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) resumed gently. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish to ask you something of a very practical nature, which I have
been thinking of ever since that day last week in the meads. I shall
soon want to marry, and, being a farmer, you see I shall require for
my wife a woman who knows all about the management of farms. Will
you be that woman, Tessy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) put it that way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had yielded to an
impulse of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) head would disapprove.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned quite careworn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had bowed to the inevitable result of
proximity, the necessity of loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not calculated
upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
without quite meaning himself to do it so soon. With pain that was
like the bitterness of dissolution she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured the words of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Mr Clare--I cannot be your wife--I cannot be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own decision seemed to break Tess's very heart, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) grief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Tess!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, amazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reply, and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) still more
greedily close. <div class="bookquote">``Do you say no? Surely you love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, yes! And I would rather be yours than anybody's in the
world,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl.
<div class="bookquote">``But I CANNOT marry you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at arm's length, <div class="bookquote">``you are engaged to
marry some one else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you refuse me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to marry! I have not thought of doing it. I cannot!
I only want to love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Driven to subterfuge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stammered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father is a parson, and your mother wouldn' like you to marry
such as me. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will want you to marry a lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense--I have spoken to them both. That was partly why I went
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel I cannot--never, never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it too sudden to be asked thus, my Pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I did not expect it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will let it pass, please, Tessy, I will give you time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``It was very abrupt to come home and speak to you all at once.
I'll not allude to it again for a while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) again took up the shining skimmer, held it beneath the pump, and
began anew. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not, as at other times, hit the exact
under-surface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required, try
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might; sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was cutting down into the milk, sometimes
in the air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could hardly see, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes having filled with two
blurring tears drawn forth by a grief which, to this her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) best friend
and dear advocate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could never explain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't skim--I can't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, turning away from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/>Not to agitate and hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) longer, the considerate Clare began
talking in a more general way:

<p/>You quite misapprehend my parents. They are the most simple-mannered
people alive, and quite unambitious. They are two of the few
remaining Evangelical school. Tessy, are you an Evangelical?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go to church very regularly, and our parson here is not very
High, they tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's ideas on the views of the parish clergyman, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard
every week, seemed to be rather more vague than Clare's, who had
never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could fix my mind on what I hear there more firmly than I
do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) remarked as a safe generality. <div class="bookquote">``It is often a great sorrow
to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) spoke so unaffectedly that Angel was sure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) heart that his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
father could not object to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) on religious grounds, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
did not know whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) principles were High, Low or Broad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
himself knew that, in reality, the confused beliefs which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) held,
apparently imbibed in childhood, were, if anything, Tractarian as to
phraseology, and Pantheistic as to essence. Confused or otherwise,
to disturb them was his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) last desire:


<p/>Leave thou thy sister, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) prays,
Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) early Heaven, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) happy views;
Nor thou with shadow'd hint confuse
A life that leads melodious days.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had occasionally thought the counsel less honest than musical; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) gladly conformed to it now.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) spoke further of the incidents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) visit, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father's mode
of life, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) zeal for his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) principles; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) grew serener, and the
undulations disappeared from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) skimming; as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) finished one lead
after another he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and drew the plugs for letting down
the milk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancied you looked a little downcast when you came in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
ventured to observe, anxious to keep away from the subject of
herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--well, my father had been talking a good deal to me of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
troubles and difficulties, and the subject always tends to depress
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is so zealous that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gets many snubs and buffetings from
people of a different way of thinking from himself, and I don't
like to hear of such humiliations to a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age, the more
particularly as I don't think earnestness does any good when carried
so far. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been telling me of a very unpleasant scene in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took part quite recently. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went as the deputy of some
missionary society to preach in the neighbourhood of Trantridge, a
place forty miles from here, and made it his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business to expostulate
with a lax young cynic he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met with somewhere about there--son of some
landowner up that way--and who has a mother afflicted with blindness.
My father addressed himself to the gentleman point-blank, and there
was quite a disturbance. It was very foolish of my father, I
must say, to intrude his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) conversation upon a stranger when the
probabilities were so obvious that it would be useless. But whatever
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thinks to be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) duty, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll do, in season or out of season;
and, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) makes many enemies, not only among the absolutely
vicious, but among the easy-going, who hate being bothered. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) glories in what happened, and that good may be done indirectly;
but I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not wear himself out now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is getting old, and
would leave such pigs to their wallowing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's look had grown hard and worn, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ripe mouth tragical; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) no longer showed any tremulousness. Clare's revived thoughts of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) particularly; and so they went
on down the white row of liquid rectangles till they had finished
and drained them off, when the other maids returned, and took their
pails, and Deb came to scald out the leads for the new milk. As
Tess withdrew to go afield to the cows he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) softly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And my question, Tessy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>replied she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with grave hopelessness, as one who had
heard anew the turmoil of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own past in the allusion to Alec
d``Urberville. ``It CAN<div class="bookquote">``T be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went out towards the mead, joining the other milkmaids with
a bound, as if trying to make the open air drive away her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sad
constraint. All the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows
were grazing in the farther mead, the bevy advancing with the bold
grace of wild animals--the reckless, unchastened motion of women
accustomed to unlimited space--in which they abandoned themselves to
the air as a swimmer to the wave. It seemed natural enough to him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)
now that Tess was again in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained
Nature, and not from the abodes of Art.



<p/>XXVIII


<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) refusal, though unexpected, did not permanently daunt Clare.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) experience of women was great enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to be aware that
the negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the
affirmative; and it was little enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) not to know that in
the manner of the present negative there lay a great exception to
the dallyings of coyness. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had already permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to
make love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) read as an additional assurance, not fully
trowing that in the fields and pastures to <div class="bookquote">``sigh gratis''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>is by no
means deemed waste; love-making being here more often accepted
inconsiderately and for its own sweet sake than in the carking,
anxious homes of the ambitious, where a girl's craving for an
establishment paralyzes her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) healthy thought of a passion as an end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess, why did you say `no' in such a positive way?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in
the course of a few days.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me. I told you why--partly. I am not good enough--not
worthy enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How? Not fine lady enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--something like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>murmured she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Your friends would scorn
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, you mistake them--my father and mother. As for my brothers,
I don't care--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fingers behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
from slipping away. <div class="bookquote">``Now--you did not mean it, sweet?--I am sure you
did not! You have made me so restless that I cannot read, or play,
or do anything. I am in no hurry, Tess, but I want to know--to hear
from your own warm lips--that you will some day be mine--any time you
may choose; but some day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could only shake her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and look away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>Clare regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attentively, conned the characters of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face as
if they had been hieroglyphics. The denial seemed real.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I ought not to hold you in this way--ought I? I have no
right to you--no right to seek out where you are, or walk with you!
Honestly, Tess, do you love any other man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you ask?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, with continued self-suppression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I almost know that you do not. But then, why do you repulse me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't repulse you. I like you to--tell me you love me; and you
may always tell me so as you go about with me--and never offend me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will not accept me as a husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--that's different--it is for your good, indeed, my dearest!
O, believe me, it is only for your sake! I don't like to give
myself the great happiness o' promising to be yours in that
way--because--because I am SURE I ought not to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will make me happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--you think so, but you don't know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At such times as this, apprehending the grounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) refusal to be
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) modest sense of incompetence in matters social and polite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
would say that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was wonderfully well-informed and versatile--which
was certainly true, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) natural quickness and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) admiration for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
having led her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) vocabulary, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) accent, and fragments
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knowledge, to a surprising extent. After these tender
contests and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) victory she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would go away by herself under the
remotest cow, if at milking-time, or into the sedge or into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) room,
if at a leisure interval, and mourn silently, not a minute after an
apparently phlegmatic negative.

<p/>The struggle was so fearful; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own heart was so strongly on the
side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)--two ardent hearts against one poor little conscience--
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tried to fortify her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) resolution by every means in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) power.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had come to Talbothays with a made-up mind. On no account could
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) agree to a step which might afterwards cause bitter rueing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
husband for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blindness in wedding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) held that what her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
conscience had decided for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind was unbiassed ought not
to be overruled now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't somebody tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) all about me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It was only
forty miles off--why hasn't it reached here? Somebody must know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet nobody seemed to know; nobody told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/>For two or three days no more was said. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) guessed from the sad
countenances of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chamber companions that they regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not
only as the favourite, but as the chosen; but they could see for
themselves that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not put herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) way.

<p/>Tess had never before known a time in which the thread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life
was so distinctly twisted of two strands, positive pleasure and
positive pain. At the next cheese-making the pair were again left
alone together. The dairyman himself had been lending a hand; but
Mr Crick, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) wife, seemed latterly to have acquired a
suspicion of mutual interest between these two; though they walked
so circumspectly that suspicion was but of the faintest. Anyhow, the
dairyman left them to themselves.

<p/>They were breaking up the masses of curd before putting them into
the vats. The operation resembled the act of crumbling bread on a
large scale; and amid the immaculate whiteness of the curds Tess
Durbeyfield's hands showed themselves of the pinkness of the rose.
Angel, who was filling the vats with his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) handful, suddenly ceased,
and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) hands flat upon hers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) sleeves were rolled far above
the elbow, and bending lower he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) kissed the inside vein of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) soft
arm.

<p/>Although the early September weather was sultry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) arm, from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) dabbling in the curds, was as cold and damp to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mouth as a
new-gathered mushroom, and tasted of the whey. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was such
a sheaf of susceptibilities that her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) pulse was accelerated by the
touch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) blood driven to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) finder-ends, and the cool arms
flushed hot. Then, as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) heart had said, <div class="bookquote">``Is coyness longer
necessary? Truth is truth between man and woman, as between man and
man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) eyes and they beamed devotedly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>), as her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
lip rose in a tender half-smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know why I did that, Tess?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you love me very much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and as a preliminary to a new entreaty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not AGAIN!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) looked a sudden fear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) resistance might break down under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) own desire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Tessy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I CANNOT think why you are so tantalizing.
Why do you disappoint me so? You seem almost like a coquette, upon
my life you do--a coquette of the first urban water! They blow
hot and blow cold, just as you do, and it is the very last sort of
thing to expect to find in a retreat like Talbothays. ... And yet,
dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) quickly added, observing now the remark had cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I
know you to be the most honest, spotless creature that ever lived.
So how can I suppose you a flirt? Tess, why don't you like the idea
of being my wife, if you love me as you seem to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never said I don't like the idea, and I never could say it;
because--it isn't true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div><p/>The stress now getting beyond endurance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) lip quivered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
was obliged to go away. Clare was so pained and perplexed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
ran after and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) in the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, tell me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, passionately clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), in
forgetfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) curdy hands: <div class="bookquote">``do tell me that you won't belong
to anybody but me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, I will tell you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``And I will give you a
complete answer, if you will let me go now. I will tell you my
experiences--all about myself--all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your experiences, dear; yes, certainly; any number.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) expressed
assent in loving satire, looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``My Tess, no doubt,
almost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on the
garden hedge, that opened itself this morning for the first time.
Tell me anything, but don't use that wretched expression any more
about not being worthy of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try--not! And I'll give you my reasons to-morrow--next
week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say on Sunday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, on Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) got away, and did not stop in her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) retreat till she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was in
the thicket of pollard willows at the lower side of the barton, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) could be quite unseen. Here Tess flung herself down upon the
rustling undergrowth of spear-grass, as upon a bed, and remained
crouching in palpitating misery broken by momentary shoots of joy,
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fears about the ending could not altogether suppress.

<p/>In reality, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was drifting into acquiescence. Every see-saw of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
breath, every wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) blood, every pulse singing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ears, was
a voice that joined with nature in revolt against her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) scrupulousness.
Reckless, inconsiderate acceptance of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); to close with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at the
altar, revealing nothing, and chancing discovery; to snatch ripe
pleasure before the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>): that was what love counselled; and in almost a terror of ecstasy
Tess divined that, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) many months of lonely self-chastisement,
wrestlings, communings, schemes to lead a future of austere
isolation, love's counsel would prevail.

<p/>The afternoon advanced, and still she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) remained among the willows.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands;
the <div class="bookquote">``waow-waow!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>which accompanied the getting together of the cows.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not go to the milking. They would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) agitation;
and the dairyman, thinking the cause to be love alone, would
good-naturedly tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); and that harassment could not be borne.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lover must have guessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) overwrought state, and invented some
excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) non-appearance, for no inquiries were made or calls
given. At half-past six the sun settled down upon the levels with
the aspect of a great forge in the heavens; and presently a monstrous
pumpkin-like moon arose on the other hand. The pollard willows,
tortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings, became
spiny-haired monsters as they stood up against it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went in and
upstairs without a light.

<p/>It was now Wednesday. Thursday came, and Angel looked thoughtfully
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from a distance, but intruded in no way upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). The indoor
milkmaids, Marian and the rest, seemed to guess that something
definite was afoot, for they did not force any remarks upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) in
the bedchamber. Friday passed; Saturday. To-morrow was the day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall give way--I shall say yes--I shall let myself marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)--I cannot help it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) jealously panted, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) hot face to
the pillow that night, on hearing one of the other girls sigh his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
name in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) sleep. <div class="bookquote">``I can't bear to let anybody have him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) but me!
Yet it is a wrong to him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>), and may kill him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) knows! O my
heart--O--O--O!''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>XXIX


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, who mid ye think I've heard news o' this morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dairyman Crick/Crick</b></font>)</div>said
Dairyman Crick, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) sat down to breakfast next day, with a riddling
gaze round upon the munching men and maids. <div class="bookquote">``Now, just who mid ye
think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One guessed, and another guessed. Mrs Crick did not guess, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) knew already.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman Dollop</b></font>)</div>said the dairyman, <div class="bookquote">''`tis that slack-twisted `hore's-bird of a
feller, Jack Dollop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>)'s lately got married to a widow-woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman Dollop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Jack Dollop? A villain--to think o' that!''  (<font color='red'><b>a milker</b></font>)</div>said a milker.

<p/>The name entered quickly into Tess Durbeyfield's consciousness, for
it was the name of the lover who had wronged his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sweetheart, and had
afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman's mother in the
butter-churn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And had he (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) married the valiant matron's daughter, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) promised?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>asked Angel Clare absently, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) turned over the newspaper he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was
reading at the little table to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was always banished by Mrs
Crick, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) gentility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>), sir. Never meant to,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>replied the dairyman. <div class="bookquote">``As I say, `tis
a widow-woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had money, it seems--fifty poun' a year or so;
and that was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) was after. They were married in a great hurry;
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) that by marrying she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fifty poun'
a year. Just fancy the state o' my gentleman's mind at that news!
Never such a cat-and-dog life as they've been leading ever since!
Serves him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) well beright. But onluckily the poor woman gets the worst
o`t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Crick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the silly body should have told en sooner that the ghost of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first man would trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Crick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Crick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>responded the dairyman indecisively. <div class="bookquote">``Still, you can see
exactly how 'twas. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted a home, and didn't like to run the
risk of losing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Don't ye think that was something like it,
maidens?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) glanced towards the row of girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to ha' told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just before they went to church, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could hardly have backed out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Marian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>agreed Izz.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must have seen what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was after, and should ha' refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Retty spasmodically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you say, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>asked the dairyman of Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought--to have told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the true state of things--or
else refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>replied Tess, the bread-and-butter
choking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be cust if I'd have done either o`t,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beck Knibbs</b></font>)</div>said Beck Knibbs, a married
helper from one of the cottages. <div class="bookquote">``All's fair in love and war. I'd
ha' married en just as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>cust</b></font>)'d said two words to me
about not telling him (<font color='blue'><b>cust</b></font>) beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first

rolling-pin--a scram little feller like he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>)! Any woman could do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The laughter which followed this sally was supplemented only by a
sorry smile, for form's sake, from Tess. What was comedy to them was
tragedy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could hardly bear their mirth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soon rose
from table, and, with an impression that Clare would soon follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),
went along a little wriggling path, now stepping to one side of the
irrigating channels, and now to the other, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stood by the main
stream of the Var. Men had been cutting the water-weeds higher up
the river, and masses of them were floating past her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--moving islands
of green crow-foot, whereon she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might almost have ridden; long locks
of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows
from crossing.

<p/>Yes, there was the pain of it. This question of a woman telling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
story--the heaviest of crosses to herself--seemed but amusement to
others. It was as if people should laugh at martyrdom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tessy!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>came from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and Clare sprang across the gully,
alighting beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``My wife--soon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; I cannot. For your sake, O Mr Clare; for your sake, I say
no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still I say no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>Not expecting this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm lightly round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waist the
moment after speaking, beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hanging tail of hair. -LRB-The
younger dairymaids, including Tess, breakfasted with their hair loose
on Sunday mornings before building it up extra high for attending
church, a style they could not adopt when milking with their heads
against the cows.-RRB- If she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had said <div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>instead of <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
would have kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); it had evidently been his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) intention; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) determined negative deterred his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) scrupulous heart. Their
condition of domiciliary comradeship put her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), as the woman, to such
disadvantage by its enforced intercourse, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) felt it unfair to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to exercise any pressure of blandishment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) might have
honestly employed had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) been better able to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) released
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) momentarily-imprisoned waist, and withheld the kiss.

<p/>It all turned on that release. What had given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strength to refuse
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman;
and that would have been overcome in another moment. But Angel said
no more; his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) face was perplexed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) went away.

<p/>Day after day they met--somewhat less constantly than before; and
thus two or three weeks went by. The end of September drew near, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could see in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) eye that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) might ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) plan of procedure was different now--as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had made up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mind that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) negatives were, after all, only coyness and youth
startled by the novelty of the proposal. The fitful evasiveness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the
idea. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) played a more coaxing game; and while never going beyond
words, or attempting the renewal of caresses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) utmost
orally.

<p/>In this way Clare persistently wooed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in undertones like that of
the purling milk--at the cow's side, at skimmings, at butter-makings,
at cheese-makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs--as
no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man.

<p/>Tess knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) must break down. Neither a religious sense of a
certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish
for candour could hold out against it much longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so
passionately, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so godlike in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes; and being, though
untrained, instinctively refined, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) nature cried for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tutelary
guidance. And thus, though Tess kept repeating to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I can
never be his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>the words were vain. A proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) weakness lay
in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the
trouble to formulate. Every sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice beginning on the old
subject stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with a terrifying bliss, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) coveted the
recantation she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feared.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner was--what man's is not?--so much that of one who would
love and cherish and defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) under any conditions, changes,
charges, or revelations, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gloom lessened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) basked in it.
The season meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox, and though
it was still fine, the days were much shorter. The dairy had again
worked by morning candlelight for a long time; and a fresh renewal
of Clare's pleading occurred one morning between three and four.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had run up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bedgown to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) door to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) as usual;
then had gone back to dress and call the others; and in ten minutes
was walking to the head of the stairs with the candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
hand. At the same moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) came down his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) steps from above in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
shirt-sleeves and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm across the stairway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Miss Flirt, before you go down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said peremptorily. <div class="bookquote">``It is a
fortnight since I spoke, and this won't do any longer. You MUST tell
me what you mean, or I shall have to leave this house. My door was
ajar just now, and I saw you. For your own safety I must go. You
don't know. Well? Is it to be yes at last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am only just up, Mr Clare, and it is too early to take me to
task!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pouted. ``You need not call me Flirt. <div class="bookquote">``Tis cruel and
untrue. Wait till by and by. Please wait till by and by! I will
really think seriously about it between now and then. Let me go
downstairs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked a little like what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was as, holding the candle
sideways, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tried to smile away the seriousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call me Angel, then, and not Mr Clare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel dearest--why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Twould mean that I agree, wouldn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would only mean that you love me, even if you cannot marry me;
and you were so good as to own that long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Very well, then, <div class="bookquote">``Angel dearest', if I MUST,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured, looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) candle, a roguish curl coming upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth, notwithstanding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) suspense.

<p/>Clare had resolved never to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
promise; but somehow, as Tess stood there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) prettily tucked-up
milking gown, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hair carelessly heaped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head till there
should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) resolve, and brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lips to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek for one
moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) passed downstairs very quickly, never looking back at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) or saying another word. The other maids were already down,
and the subject was not pursued. Except Marian, they all looked
wistfully and suspiciously at the pair, in the sad yellow rays which
the morning candles emitted in contrast with the first cold signals
of the dawn without.

<p/>When skimming was done--which, as the milk diminished with the
approach of autumn, was a lessening process day by day--Retty and
the rest went out. The lovers followed them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our tremulous lives are so different from theirs, are they not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
musingly observed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) regarded the three figures tripping
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) through the frigid pallor of opening day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so very different, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you think that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are very few women's lives that are not--tremulous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Tess
replied, pausing over the new word as if it impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``There's
more in those three than you think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is in them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost either of 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``would make--perhaps would
make--a properer wife than I. And perhaps they love you as well
as I--almost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Tessy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There were signs that it was an exquisite relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to hear the
impatient exclamation, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had resolved so intrepidly to let
generosity make one bid against herself. That was now done, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had not the power to attempt self-immolation a second time then.
They were joined by a milker from one of the cottages, and no more
was said on that which concerned them so deeply. But Tess knew that
this day would decide it.

<p/>In the afternoon several of the dairyman's household and assistants
went down to the meads as usual, a long way from the dairy, where
many of the cows were milked without being driven home. The
supply was getting less as the animals advanced in calf, and the
supernumerary milkers of the lush green season had been dismissed.

<p/>The work progressed leisurely. Each pailful was poured into tall
cans that stood in a large spring-waggon which had been brought
upon the scene; and when they were milked, the cows trailed away.
Dairyman Crick, who was there with the rest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) wrapper gleaming
miraculously white against a leaden evening sky, suddenly looked
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) heavy watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis later than I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Begad! We shan't be
soon enough with this milk at the station, if we don't mind. There's
no time to-day to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending
off. It must go to station straight from here. Who'll drive it
across?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Clare volunteered to do so, though it was none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) business,
asking Tess to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). The evening, though sunless, had
been warm and muggy for the season, and Tess had come out with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) milking-hood only, naked-armed and jacketless; certainly not
dressed for a drive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) therefore replied by glancing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
scant habiliments; but Clare gently urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) assented by
relinquishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pail and stool to the dairyman to take home, and
mounted the spring-waggon beside Clare.



<p/>XXX


<p/>In the diminishing daylight they went along the level roadway through
the meads, which stretched away into gray miles, and were backed in
the extreme edge of distance by the swarthy and abrupt slopes of
Egdon Heath. On its summit stood clumps and stretches of fir-trees,
whose notched tips appeared like battlemented towers crowning
black-fronted castles of enchantment.

<p/>They were so absorbed in the sense of being close to each other that
they did not begin talking for a long while, the silence being broken
only by the clucking of the milk in the tall cans behind them.
The lane they followed was so solitary that the hazel nuts had
remained on the boughs till they slipped from their shells, and the
blackberries hung in heavy clusters. Every now and then Angel would
fling the lash of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) whip round one of these, pluck it off, and give
it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) companion.

<p/>The dull sky soon began to tell its meaning by sending down
herald-drops of rain, and the stagnant air of the day changed into
a fitful breeze which played about their faces. The quick-silvery
glaze on the rivers and pools vanished; from broad mirrors of light
they changed to lustreless sheets of lead, with a surface like a
rasp. But that spectacle did not affect her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) preoccupation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
countenance, a natural carnation slightly embrowned by the season,
had deepened its tinge with the beating of the rain-drops; and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
hair, which the pressure of the cows' flanks had, as usual, caused to
tumble down from its fastenings and stray beyond the curtain of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
calico bonnet, was made clammy by the moisture, till it hardly was
better than seaweed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought not to have come, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) murmured, looking at the
sky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for the rain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But how glad I am to have you
here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Egdon/Egdon Heath</b></font>)</div><p/>Remote Egdon disappeared by degree behind the liquid gauze. The
evening grew darker, and the roads being crossed by gates, it was
not safe to drive faster than at a walking pace. The air was rather
chill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so afraid you will get cold, with nothing upon your arms and
shoulders,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Creep close to me, and perhaps the drizzle
won't hurt you much. I should be sorrier still if I did not think
that the rain might be helping me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) imperceptibly crept closer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) wrapped round them both a
large piece of sail-cloth, which was sometimes used to keep the sun
off the milk-cans. Tess held it from slipping off him (<font color='blue'><b>Egdon</b></font>) as well as
herself, Clare's hands being occupied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we are all right again. Ah--no we are not! It runs down into
my neck a little, and it must still more into yours. That's better.
Your arms are like wet marble, Tess. Wipe them in the cloth. Now,
if you stay quiet, you will not get another drop. Well, dear--about
that question of mine--that long-standing question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The only reply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could hear for a little while was the smack of
the horse's hoofs on the moistening road, and the cluck of the milk
in the cans behind them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember what you said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before we get home, mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said no more then. As they drove on, the fragment of an old manor
house of Caroline date rose against the sky, and was in due course
passed and left behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) observed, to entertain her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>), ``is an interesting old
place--one of the several seats which belonged to an ancient Norman
family formerly of great influence in this county, the d<div class="bookquote">``Urbervilles.
I never pass one of their residences without thinking of them. There
is something very sad in the extinction of a family of renown, even
if it was fierce, domineering, feudal renown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/>They crept along towards a point in the expanse of shade just at hand
at which a feeble light was beginning to assert its presence, a spot
where, by day, a fitful white streak of steam at intervals upon the
dark green background denoted intermittent moments of contact between
their secluded world and modern life. Modern life stretched out its
steam feeler to this point three or four times a day, touched the
native existences, and quickly withdrew its feeler again, as if what
it touched had been uncongenial.

<p/>They reached the feeble light, which came from the smoky lamp of a
little railway station; a poor enough terrestrial star, yet in one
sense of more importance to Talbothays Dairy and mankind than the
celestial ones to which it stood in such humiliating contrast. The
cans of new milk were unladen in the rain, Tess getting a little
shelter from a neighbouring holly tree.

<p/>Then there was the hissing of a train, which drew up almost silently
upon the wet rails, and the milk was rapidly swung can by can into
the truck. The light of the engine flashed for a second upon Tess
Durbeyfield's figure, motionless under the great holly tree. No
object could have looked more foreign to the gleaming cranks and
wheels than this unsophisticated girl, with the round bare arms, the
rainy face and hair, the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at
pause, the print gown of no date or fashion, and the cotton bonnet
drooping on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brow.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mounted again beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover, with a mute obedience
characteristic of impassioned natures at times, and when they had
wrapped themselves up over head and ears in the sailcloth again, they
plunged back into the now thick night. Tess was so receptive that
the few minutes of contact with the whirl of material progress
lingered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Londoners will drink it at their breakfasts to-morrow, won't they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Strange people that we have never seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I suppose they will. Though not as we send it. When its
strength has been lowered, so that it may not get up into their
heads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Noble men and noble women, ambassadors and centurions, ladies and
tradeswomen, and babies who have never seen a cow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; perhaps; particularly centurions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who don't know anything of us, and where it comes from; or think how
we two drove miles across the moor to-night in the rain that it might
reach 'em in time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We did not drive entirely on account of these precious Londoners; we
drove a little on our own--on account of that anxious matter which
you will, I am sure, set at rest, dear Tess. Now, permit me to put
it in this way. You belong to me already, you know; your heart, I
mean. Does it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know as well as I. O yes--yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, if your heart does, why not your hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My only reason was on account of you--on account of a question. I
have something to tell you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose it to be entirely for my happiness, and my worldly
convenience also?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes; if it is for your happiness and worldly convenience. But my
life before I came here--I want--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is for my convenience as well as my happiness. If I have a
very large farm, either English or colonial, you will be invaluable
as a wife to me; better than a woman out of the largest mansion in
the country. So please--please, dear Tessy, disabuse your mind of
the feeling that you will stand in my way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my history. I want you to know it--you must let me tell
you--you will not like me so well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell it if you wish to, dearest. This precious history then. Yes,
I was born at so and so, Anno Domini--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was born at Marlott,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, catching at his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) words as a help,
lightly as they were spoken. <div class="bookquote">``And I grew up there. And I was in the
Sixth Standard when I left school, and they said I had great aptness,
and should make a good teacher, so it was settled that I should
be one. But there was trouble in my family; father was not very
industrious, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drank a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. Poor child! Nothing new.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) more closely
to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then--there is something very unusual about it--about me. I--I
was--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's breath quickened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dearest. Never mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I--I--am not a Durbeyfield, but a d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville--a descendant of the

all gone to nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``A d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville!--Indeed! And is that all the trouble, dear Tess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--why should I love you less after knowing this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was told by the dairyman that you hated old families.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is true, in one sense. I do hate the aristocratic
principle of blood before everything, and do think that as reasoners
the only pedigrees we ought to respect are those spiritual ones of
the wise and virtuous, without regard to corporal paternity. But
I am extremely interested in this news--you can have no idea how
interested I am! Are you not interested yourself in being one of
that well-known line?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I have thought it sad--especially since coming here, and
knowing that many of the hills and fields I see once belonged to
my father's people. But other hills and field belonged to Retty's
people, and perhaps others to Marian's, so that I don't value it
particularly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes--it is surprising how many of the present tillers of the soil

of politicians don't make capital of the circumstance; but they don't
seem to know it... I wonder that I did not see the resemblance of

this was the carking secret!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not told. At the last moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) courage had failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>);
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feared his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) blame for not telling him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sooner; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) instinct
of self-preservation was stronger than her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) candour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>continued the unwitting Clare, ``I should have been glad
to know you to be descended exclusively from the long-suffering,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, that it is only your wanting me very much, and being hardly

me feel I ought to say I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) close and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had no sooner said it than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) burst into a dry hard sobbing, so
violent that it seemed to rend her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Tess was not a hysterical girl
by any means, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you cry, dearest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell--quite!--I am so glad to think--of being yours, and
making you happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this does not seem very much like gladness, my Tessy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean--I cry because I have broken down in my vow! I said I would

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, yes! But O, I sometimes wish I had never been born!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear Tess, if I did not know that you are very much excited,
and very inexperienced, I should say that remark was not very
complimentary. How came you to wish that if you care for me? Do you
care for me? I wish you would prove it in some way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I prove it more than I have done?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried, in a
distraction of tenderness. <div class="bookquote">``Will this prove it more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) neck, and for the first time Clare learnt what an
impassioned woman's kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
loved with all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart and soul, as Tess loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There--now do you believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked, flushed, and wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I never really doubted--never, never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So they drove on through the gloom, forming one bundle inside the
sail-cloth, the horse going as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would, and the rain driving against
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had consented. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might as well have agreed at first.
The <div class="bookquote">``appetite for joy''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which pervades all creation, that tremendous
force which sways humanity to its purpose, as the tide sways the

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXI


<p/>Tess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother the very
next day, and by the end of the week a response to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) communication
arrived in Joan Durbeyfield's wandering last-century hand.


<p/>DEAR TESS,--

<p/>J write these few lines Hoping they will find you well,
as they leave me at Present, thank God for it. Dear
Tess, we are all glad to Hear that you are going really
to be married soon. But with respect to your question,
Tess, J say between ourselves, quite private but very
strong, that on no account do you say a word of your
Bygone Trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). J did not tell everything
to your Father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) being so Proud on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
Respectability, which, perhaps, your Intended is
the same. Many a woman--some of the Highest in the
Land--have had a Trouble in their time; and why should
you Trumpet yours when others don't Trumpet theirs? No
girl would be such a Fool, specially as it is so long
ago, and not your Fault at all. J shall answer the
same if you ask me fifty times. Besides, you must bear
in mind that, knowing it to be your Childish Nature to
tell all that's in your heart--so simple!--J made you
promise me never to let it out by Word or Deed, having
your Welfare in my Mind; and you most solemnly did
promise it going from this Door. J have not named
either that Question or your coming marriage to your
Father, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would blab it everywhere, poor Simple
Man.

<p/>Dear Tess, keep up your Spirits, and we mean to send
you a Hogshead of Cyder for you Wedding, knowing there
is not much in your parts, and thin Sour Stuff what
there is. So no more at present, and with kind love
to your Young Man.--From your affectte. Mother,

<p/>J. DURBEYFIELD


<p/><div class="bookquote">``O mother, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>J.</b></font>)</div>murmured Tess.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was recognizing how light was the touch of events the most
oppressive upon Mrs Durbeyfield's elastic spirit. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) mother did not
see life as Tess saw it. That haunting episode of bygone days was
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother but a passing accident. But perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother was
right as to the course to be followed, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might be in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
reasons. Silence seemed, on the face of it, best for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) adored
one's happiness: silence it should be.

<p/>Thus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had
any shadow of right to control her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) action, Tess grew calmer. The
responsibility was shifted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart was lighter than it had
been for weeks. The days of declining autumn which followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
assent, beginning with the month of October, formed a season through
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching
ecstasy than any other period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life.

<p/>There was hardly a touch of earth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) love for Clare. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
sublime trustfulness he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was all that goodness could be--knew all that
a guide, philosopher, and friend should know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought every line
in the contour of his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) person the perfection of masculine beauty, his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>)
soul the soul of a saint, his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) intellect that of a seer. The wisdom
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>), as love, sustained her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dignity; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seemed to be
wearing a crown. The compassion of his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw it,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart to him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) in devotion. He (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) would sometimes
catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) large, worshipful eyes, that had no bottom to them looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) from their depths, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw something immortal before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dismissed the past--trod upon it and put it out, as one treads on
a coal that is smouldering and dangerous.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not known that men could be so disinterested, chivalrous,
protective, in their love for women as he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>). Angel Clare was far from
all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) in this respect; absurdly far, indeed;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was, in truth, more spiritual than animal; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had himself
well in hand, and was singularly free from grossness. Though not
cold-natured, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was rather bright than hot--less Byronic than
Shelleyan; could love desperately, but with a love more especially
inclined to the imaginative and ethereal; it was a fastidious emotion
which could jealously guard the loved one against his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) very self.
This amazed and enraptured Tess, whose slight experiences had been so
infelicitous till now; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reaction from indignation against
the male sex she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) swerved to excess of honour for Clare.

<p/>They unaffectedly sought each other's company; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) honest faith
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not disguise her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) desire to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). The sum of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
instincts on this matter, if clearly stated, would have been that the
elusive quality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sex which attracts men in general might be
distasteful to so perfect a man after an avowal of love, since it
must in its very nature carry with it a suspicion of art.

<p/>The country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during
betrothal was the only custom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) it had no
strangeness; though it seemed oddly anticipative to Clare till he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
saw how normal a thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), in common with all the other dairy-folk,
regarded it. Thus, during this October month of wonderful afternoons
they roved along the meads by creeping paths which followed the
brinks of trickling tributary brooks, hopping across by little wooden
bridges to the other side, and back again. They were never out of
the sound of some purling weir, whose buzz accompanied their own
murmuring, while the beams of the sun, almost as horizontal as the
mead itself, formed a pollen of radiance over the landscape. They
saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges, all the time
that there was bright sunshine elsewhere. The sun was so near the
ground, and the sward so flat, that the shadows of Clare and Tess
would stretch a quarter of a mile ahead of them, like two long
fingers pointing afar to where the green alluvial reaches abutted
against the sloping sides of the vale.

<p/>Men were at work here and there--for it was the season for <div class="bookquote">``taking
up''  (<font color='red'><b>Men</b></font>)</div>the meadows, or digging the little waterways clear for the winter
irrigation, and mending their banks where trodden down by the cows.
The shovelfuls of loam, black as jet, brought there by the river
when it was as wide as the whole valley, were an essence of soils,
pounded champaigns of the past, steeped, refined, and subtilized to
extraordinary richness, out of which came all the fertility of the
mead, and of the cattle grazing there.

<p/>Clare hardily kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) waist in sight of these
watermen, with the air of a man who was accustomed to public
dalliance, though actually as shy as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) who, with lips parted and
eyes askance on the labourers, wore the look of a wary animal the
while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said
gladly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if it should reach the ears of your friends at Emminster that
you are walking about like this with me, a milkmaid--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The most bewitching milkmaid ever seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They might feel it a hurt to their dignity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``My dear girl--a d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville hurt the dignity of a Clare! It is a
grand card to play--that of your belonging to such a family, and I
am reserving it for a grand effect when we are married, and have
the proofs of your descent from Parson Tringham. Apart from that,
my future is to be totally foreign to my family--it will not affect
even the surface of their lives. We shall leave this part of
England--perhaps England itself--and what does it matter how people
regard us here? You will like going, will you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could answer no more than a bare affirmative, so great was the
emotion aroused in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) at the thought of going through the world with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own familiar friend. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feelings almost filled her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ears
like a babble of waves, and surged up to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and thus they went on, to a place where the reflected sun
glared up from the river, under a bridge, with a molten-metallic glow
that dazzled their eyes, though the sun itself was hidden by the
bridge. They stood still, whereupon little furred and feathered
heads popped up from the smooth surface of the water; but, finding
that the disturbing presences had paused, and not passed by, they
disappeared again. Upon this river-brink they lingered till the fog
began to close round them--which was very early in the evening at
this time of the year--settling on the lashes of her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) eyes, where it
rested like crystals, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) brows and hair.

<p/>They walked later on Sundays, when it was quite dark. Some of the
dairy-people, who were also out of doors on the first Sunday evening
after their engagement, heard her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) impulsive speeches, ecstasized to
fragments, though they were too far off to hear the words discoursed;
noted the spasmodic catch in her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) remarks, broken into syllables by
the leapings of her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) heart, as she (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) walked leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arm; her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>)
contented pauses, the occasional little laugh upon which her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) soul
seemed to ride--the laugh of a woman in company with the man she (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>)
loves and has won from all other women--unlike anything else in
nature. They marked the buoyancy of her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) tread, like the skim of a
bird which has not quite alighted.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now the breath and life of Tess's being;
it enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as a photosphere, irradiated her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) into forgetfulness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) past sorrows, keeping back the gloomy spectres that would
persist in their attempts to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--doubt, fear, moodiness, care,
shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the
circumscribing light, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had long spells of power to keep them
in hungry subjection there.

<p/>A spiritual forgetfulness co-existed with an intellectual
remembrance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walked in brightness, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew that in the
background those shapes of darkness were always spread. They might
be receding, or they might be approaching, one or the other, a little
every day.


<p/>One evening Tess and Clare were obliged to sit indoors keeping house,
all the other occupants of the domicile being away. As they talked
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked thoughtfully up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and met his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) two appreciative eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not worthy of you--no, I am not!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) burst out, jumping up
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) low stool as though appalled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) homage, and the fulness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own joy thereat.

<p/>Clare, deeming the whole basis of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) excitement to be that which was
only the smaller part of it, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't have you speak like it, dear Tess! Distinction does not
consist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions, but
in being numbered among those who are true, and honest, and just, and
pure, and lovely, and of good report--as you are, my Tess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) struggled with the sob in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) throat. How often had that string
of excellences made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) young heart ache in church of late years, and
how strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) should have cited them now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you stay and love me when I--was sixteen; living with my
little sisters and brothers, and you danced on the green? O, why
didn't you, why didn't you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, impetuously clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
hands.

<p/>Angel began to comfort and reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), thinking to himself, truly
enough, what a creature of moods she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, and how careful he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would
have to be of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) depended for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) happiness entirely on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--why didn't I stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That is just what I feel. If I
had only known! But you must not be so bitter in your regret--why
should you be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>With the woman's instinct to hide she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) diverged hastily--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have had four years more of your heart than I can ever have
now. Then I should not have wasted my time as I have done--I should
have had so much longer happiness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was no mature woman with a long dark vista of intrigue behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
who was tormented thus, but a girl of simple life, not yet one-and
twenty, who had been caught during her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) days of immaturity like a bird
in a springe. To calm herself the more completely, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
little stool and left the room, overturning the stool with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) skirts
as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) sat on by the cheerful firelight thrown from a bundle of green
ash-sticks laid across the dogs; the sticks snapped pleasantly, and
hissed out bubbles of sap from their ends. When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came back she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was herself again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you not think you are just a wee bit capricious, fitful, Tess?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said, good-humouredly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) spread a cushion for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on the
stool, and seated himself in the settle beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to
ask you something, and just then you ran away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps I am capricious,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) murmured. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly
approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>), and put a hand upon each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``No, Angel,
I am not really so--by nature, I mean!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The more particularly to
assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) placed herself close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) in the
settle, and allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head to find a resting-place against Clare's
shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``What did you want to ask me--I am sure I will answer it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) continued humbly.

<p/>``Well, you love me, and have agreed to marry me, and hence there
follows a thirdly, <div class="bookquote">``When shall the day be?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like living like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must think of starting in business on my own hook with the
new year, or a little later. And before I get involved in the
multifarious details of my new position, I should like to have
secured my partner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) timidly answered, <div class="bookquote">``to talk quite practically, wouldn't it
be best not to marry till after all that?--Though I can't bear the
thought o' your going away and leaving me here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you cannot--and it is not best in this case. I want you
to help me in many ways in making my start. When shall it be? Why
not a fortnight from now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, becoming grave: <div class="bookquote">``I have so many things to think of
first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gently nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>The reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near. Before
discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round
the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment Mr
Dairyman Crick, Mrs Crick, and two of the milkmaids.

<p/>Tess sprang like an elastic ball from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) side to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feet, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
face flushed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes shone in the firelight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew how it would be if I sat so close to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried, with
vexation. <div class="bookquote">``I said to myself, they are sure to come and catch us!
But I wasn't really sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knee, though it might ha' seemed
as if I was almost!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--if so be you hadn't told us, I am sure we shouldn't ha'
noticed that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>replied the dairyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) continued to his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) wife, with the stolid
mien of a man who understood nothing of the emotions relating to
matrimony--<div class="bookquote">``Now, Christianer, that shows that folks should never
fancy other folks be supposing things when they bain't. O no, I
should never ha' thought a word of where she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was a sitting to, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hadn't told me--not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are going to be married soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare, with improvised
phlegm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--and be ye! Well, I am truly glad to hear it, sir. I've
thought you mid do such a thing for some time. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s too good for a
dairymaid--I said so the very first day I zid her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--and a prize for
any man; and what's more, a wonderful woman for a gentleman-farmer's
wife; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't be at the mercy of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) baily wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Somehow Tess disappeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been even more struck with the
look of the girls who followed Crick than abashed by Crick's blunt
praise.

<p/>After supper, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bedroom, they were all present. A
light was burning, and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) bed,
awaiting Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood.
They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to
have. Their condition was objective, contemplative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s going to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Retty/Retty Priddle</b></font>)</div>murmured Retty, never taking eyes off
Tess. <div class="bookquote">``How her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face do show it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You BE going to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>asked Marian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They thought that this was evasiveness only.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YES--going to MARRY him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--a gentleman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>repeated Izz Huett.

<p/>And by a sort of fascination the three girls, one after another,
crept out of their beds, and came and stood barefooted round Tess.
Retty put her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hands upon Tess's shoulders, as if to realize her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
friend's corporeality after such a miracle, and the other two laid
their arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) waist, all looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How it do seem! Almost more than I can think of!''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz Huett.

<p/>Marian kissed Tess. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that because of love for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), or because other lips have touched
there by now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>continued Izz drily to Marian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't thinking o' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian simply. <div class="bookquote">``I was on'y feeling
all the strangeness o`t--that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, and nobody else.
I don't say nay to it, nor either of us, because we did not think
of it--only loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Still, nobody else is to marry'n in the
world--no fine lady, nobody in silks and satins; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) who do live
like we.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you don't dislike me for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess in a low voice.

<p/>They hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in their white nightgowns before replying, as if
they considered their answer might lie in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Retty/Retty Priddle</b></font>)</div>murmured Retty Priddle. <div class="bookquote">``I want to
hate `ee; but I cannot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's how I feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>echoed Izz and Marian. <div class="bookquote">``I can't hate her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
Somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hinders me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to marry one of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>murmured Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are all better than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We better than you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>said the girls in a low, slow whisper. <div class="bookquote">``No,
no, dear Tess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) contradicted impetuously. And suddenly tearing away
from their clinging arms she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) burst into a hysterical fit of tears,
bowing herself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly,
<div class="bookquote">``O yes, yes, yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Having once given way she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) weeping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have had one of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I think I ought to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even now! You would be better for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) than--I don't know
what I'm saying! O! O!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>They went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) round, but still her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sobs tore
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get some water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)'s upset by us, poor thing, poor
thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div><p/>They gently led her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) back to the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) bed, where they kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are best for`n,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian. <div class="bookquote">``More ladylike, and a better
scholar than we, especially since he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) had taught `ee so much. But
even you ought to be proud. You BE proud, I'm sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and I am ashamed at so breaking down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When they were all in bed, and the light was out, Marian whispered
across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will think of us when you be his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) wife, Tess, and of how we told
`ee that we loved him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>), and how we tried not to hate you, and did not
hate you, and could not hate you, because you were his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) choice, and
we never hoped to be chose by him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div><p/>They were not aware that, at these words, salt, stinging tears
trickled down upon Tess's pillow anew, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) resolved, with a
bursting heart, to tell all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) history to Angel Clare, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
mother's command--to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lived and breathed despise
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as a fool, rather then
preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), and
which somehow seemed a wrong to these.



<p/>XXXII


<p/>This penitential mood kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from naming the wedding-day. The
beginning of November found its date still in abeyance, though he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at the most tempting times. But Tess's desire seemed to be
for a perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was
then.

<p/>The meads were changing now; but it was still warm enough in early
afternoons before milking to idle there awhile, and the state of
dairy-work at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling.
Looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun, a glistening
ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary,
like the track of moonlight on the sea. Gnats, knowing nothing
of their brief glorification, wandered across the shimmer of this
pathway, irradiated as if they bore fire within them, then passed out
of its line, and were quite extinct. In the presence of these things
he (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) would remind her (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) that the date was still the question.

<p/>Or he (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) at night, when he (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) on some mission
invented by Mrs Crick to give him (<font color='blue'><b>luminary</b></font>) the opportunity. This was mostly a
journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale, to inquire how
the advanced cows were getting on in the straw-barton to which they
were relegated. For it was a time of the year that brought great
changes to the world of kine. Batches of the animals were sent away
daily to this lying-in hospital, where they lived on straw till their
calves were born, after which event, and as soon as the calf could
walk, mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy. In the
interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was, of
course, little milking to be done, but as soon as the calf had been
taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual.

<p/>Returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great
gravel-cliff immediately over the levels, where they stood still and
listened. The water was now high in the streams, squirting through
the weirs, and tinkling under culverts; the smallest gullies were all
full; there was no taking short cuts anywhere, and foot-passengers
were compelled to follow the permanent ways. From the whole extent
of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation; it forced upon
their fancy that a great city lay below them, and that the murmur was
the vociferation of its populace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems like tens of thousands of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess; <div class="bookquote">``holding
public-meetings in their market-places, arguing, preaching,
quarrelling, sobbing, groaning, praying, and cursing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare was not particularly heeding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Crick speak to you to-day, dear, about his (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) not wanting much
assistance during the winter months?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The cows are going dry rapidly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Six or seven went to the straw-barton yesterday, and three the
day before, making nearly twenty in the straw already. Ah--is it
that the farmer don't want my help for the calving? O, I am not
wanted here any more! And I have tried so hard to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Crick didn't exactly say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) would no longer require you. But,
knowing what our relations were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) said in the most good-natured
and respectful manner possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) supposed on my leaving at
Christmas I should take you with me, and on my asking what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) would
do without you he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) merely observed that, as a matter of fact, it was a
time of year when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) could do with a very little female help. I am
afraid I was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) was in this
way forcing your hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you ought to have felt glad, Angel. Because `tis
always mournful not to be wanted, even if at the same time `tis
convenient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is convenient--you have admitted that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) finger
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel the red rising up at her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) having been caught! But why should
I trifle so! We will not trifle--life is too serious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is. Perhaps I saw that before you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was seeing it then. To decline to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) after all--in
obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) emotion of last night--and leave the dairy, meant
to go to some strange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in
request now calving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm
where no divine being like Angel Clare was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hated the thought,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hated more the thought of going home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So that, seriously, dearest Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``since you will
probably have to leave at Christmas, it is in every way desirable and
convenient that I should carry you off then as my property. Besides,
if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would
know that we could not go on like this for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we could. That it would always be summer and autumn, and you
always courting me, and always thinking as much of me as you have
done through the past summer-time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I know you will!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried, with a sudden fervour of faith
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Angel, I will fix the day when I will become yours for
always!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus at last it was arranged between them, during that dark walk
home, amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left.

<p/>When they reached the dairy Mr and Mrs Crick were promptly told--with
injunctions of secrecy; for each of the lovers was desirous that the
marriage should be kept as private as possible. The dairyman, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) had thought of dismissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) soon, now made a great concern about
losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>). What should he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) do about his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) skimming? Who would make
the ornamental butter-pats for the Anglebury and Sandbourne ladies?
Mrs Crick congratulated Tess on the shilly-shallying having at last
come to an end, and said that directly she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) set eyes on Tess she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
divined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no
common outdoor man; Tess had looked so superior as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walked across
the barton on that afternoon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arrival; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was of a good
family she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could have sworn. In point of fact Mrs Crick did remember
thinking that Tess was graceful and good-looking as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) approached;
but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided
by subsequent knowledge.

<p/>Tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours, without the
sense of a will. The word had been given; the number of the day
written down. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit
the fatalistic convictions common to field-folk and those who
associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their
fellow-creatures; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) accordingly drifted into that passive
responsiveness to all things her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lover suggested, characteristic of
the frame of mind.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wrote anew to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother, ostensibly to notify the
wedding-day; really to again implore her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) advice. It was a gentleman
who had chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), which perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother had not sufficiently
considered. A post-nuptial explanation, which might be accepted with
a light heart by a rougher man, might not be received with the same
feeling by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But this communication brought no reply from Mrs
Durbeyfield.

<p/>Despite Angel Clare's plausible representation to himself and to Tess
of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in
truth an element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a
later date. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and
fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feeling for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had entertained no notion, when doomed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had thought to
an unintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) beheld in this
idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes. Unsophistication
was a thing to talk of; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had not known how it really struck one
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) came here. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was very far from seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) future track
clearly, and it might be a year or two before he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would be able to
consider himself fairly started in life. The secret lay in the tinge
of recklessness imparted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) career and character by the sense
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had been made to miss his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) true destiny through the prejudices
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think `twould have been better for us to wait till you
were quite settled in your midland farm?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) once asked timidly.
-LRB-A midland farm was the idea just then.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell the truth, my Tess, I don't like you to be left anywhere
away from my protection and sympathy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The reason was a good one, so far as it went. His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
had been so marked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) manner and habits, his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
speech and phrases, his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) likings and his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) aversions. And to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
in farmland would be to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) slip back again out of accord with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wished to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) charge for another reason.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) parents had naturally desired to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) once at least before he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) off to a distant settlement, English or colonial; and
as no opinion of theirs was to be allowed to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) intention,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) judged that a couple of months' life with him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) in lodgings
whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social
assistance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) might feel to be a trying ordeal--her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
presentation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mother at the Vicarage.

<p/>Next, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wished to see a little of the working of a flour-mill,
having an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) might combine the use of one with
corn-growing. The proprietor of a large old water-mill at
Wellbridge--once the mill of an Abbey--had offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) the inspection
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) time-honoured mode of procedure, and a hand in the operations
for a few days, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) should choose to come. Clare paid a
visit to the place, some few miles distant, one day at this time,
to inquire particulars, and returned to Talbothays in the evening.
She (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) determined to spend a short time at the Wellbridge
flour-mills. And what had determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)? Less the opportunity of an
insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings
were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which, before its
mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the d``Urberville
family. This was always how Clare settled practical questions; by
a sentiment which had nothing to do with them. They decided to go
immediately after the wedding, and remain for a fortnight, instead
of journeying to towns and inns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of
London that I have heard of,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and by March or April we will
pay a visit to my father and mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Questions of procedure such as these arose and passed, and the day,
the incredible day, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) was to become his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), loomed large in
the near future. The thirty-first of December, New Year's Eve, was
the date. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said to herself. Could it ever be? Their
two selves together, nothing to divide them, every incident shared
by them; why not? And yet why?

<p/>One Sunday morning Izz Huett returned from church, and spoke
privately to Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was not called home this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It should ha' been the first time of asking to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered,
looking quietly at Tess. <div class="bookquote">``You meant to be married New Year's Eve,
deary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other returned a quick affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there must be three times of asking. And now there be only two
Sundays left between.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek paling; Izz was right; of course there must be
three. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) had forgotten! If so, there must be a week's
postponement, and that was unlucky. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lover?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and
alarm lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) should lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dear prize.

<p/>A natural incident relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) anxiety. Izz mentioned the omission
of the banns to Mrs Crick, and Mrs Crick assumed a matron's privilege
of speaking to Angel on the point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have ye forgot 'em, Mr Clare? The banns, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have not forgot 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>says Clare.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) caught Tess alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let them tease you about the banns. A licence will be quieter
for us, and I have decided on a licence without consulting you.
So if you go to church on Sunday morning you will not hear your own
name, if you wished to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't wish to hear it, dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said proudly.

<p/>But to know that things were in train was an immense relief to Tess
notwithstanding, who had well-nigh feared that somebody would stand
up and forbid the banns on the ground of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) history. How events
were favouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite feel easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``All this good
fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill. That's
how Heaven mostly does. I wish I could have had common banns!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But everything went smoothly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would like her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
to be married in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) present best white frock, or if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ought to
buy a new one. The question was set at rest by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) forethought,
disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).
Inside them she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found a whole stock of clothing, from bonnet to
shoes, including a perfect morning costume, such as would well suit
the simple wedding they planned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) entered the house shortly after
the arrival of the packages, and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) upstairs undoing them.

<p/>A minute later she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came down with a flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face and tears in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How thoughtful you've been!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Even to the gloves and handkerchief! My own love--how
good, how kind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Tess; just an order to a tradeswoman in London--nothing
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from thinking too highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to go
upstairs, and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) time, and see if it all fitted; and, if not,
to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did return upstairs, and put on the gown. Alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stood for a
moment before the glass looking at the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) silk attire; and
then there came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's ballad of the mystic
robe--


<p/>That never would become that wife
That had once done amiss,


<p/>which Mrs Durbeyfield had used to sing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) as a child, so blithely
and so archly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) foot on the cradle, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) rocked to the tune.
Suppose this robe should betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) by changing colour, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) robe
had betrayed Queen Guinevere. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had been at the dairy she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
had not once thought of the lines till now.



<p/>XXXIII


<p/>Angel felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would like to spend a day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) before the
wedding, somewhere away from the dairy, as a last jaunt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>)
company while there were yet mere lover and mistress; a romantic day,
in circumstances that would never be repeated; with that other and
greater day beaming close ahead of them. During the preceding week,
therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town,
and they started together.

<p/>Clare's life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the
world of his (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) own class. For months he (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) had never gone near a town,
and, requiring no vehicle, had never kept one, hiring the dairyman's
cob or gig if he (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) rode or drove. They went in the gig that day.

<p/>And then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners
in one concern. It was Christmas Eve, with its loads a holly and
mistletoe, and the town was very full of strangers who had come in
from all parts of the country on account of the day. Tess paid the
penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
countenance by being much stared at as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) moved amid them on his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>)
arm.

<p/>In the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up, and
Tess waited in the entry while Angel went to see the horse and gig
brought to the door. The general sitting-room was full of guests,
who were continually going in and out. As the door opened and shut
each time for the passage of these, the light within the parlour fell
full upon Tess's face. Two men came out and passed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) among the
rest. One of them had stared her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) up and down in surprise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was a Trantridge man, though that village lay so many
miles off that Trantridge folk were rarities here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A comely maid that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True, comely enough. But unless I make a great mistake--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith.

<p/>Clare had just returned from the stable-yard, and, confronting the
man on the threshold, heard the words, and saw the shrinking of
Tess. The insult to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to the quick, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had
considered anything at all he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) struck the man on the chin with the
full force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fist, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) staggering backwards into the
passage.

<p/>The man recovered himself, and seemed inclined to come on, and Clare,
stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence. But
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) opponent began to think better of the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) looked anew at
Tess as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and said to Clare--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon, sir; 'twas a complete mistake. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was
another woman, forty miles from here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare, feeling then that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had been too hasty, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was,
moreover, to blame for leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) standing in an inn-passage, did
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) usually did in such cases, gave the man five shillings to
plaster the blow; and thus they parted, bidding each other a pacific
good night. As soon as Clare had taken the reins from the ostler,
and the young couple had driven off, the two men went in the other
direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And was it a mistake?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the second one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it. But I didn't want to hurt the gentleman's
feelings--not I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lovers</b></font>)</div><p/>In the meantime the lovers were driving onward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could we put off our wedding till a little later?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Tess asked in a
dry dull voice. <div class="bookquote">``I mean if we wished?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my love. Calm yourself. Do you mean that the fellow may have
time to summon me for assault?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) asked good-humouredly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I only meant--if it should have to be put off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) meant was not very clear, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to dismiss
such fancies from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mind, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) obediently did as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
could. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was grave, very grave, all the way home; till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
thought, <div class="bookquote">``We shall go away, a very long distance, hundreds of miles
from these parts, and such as this can never happen again, and no
ghost of the past reach there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They parted tenderly that night on the landing, and Clare ascended to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) attic. Tess sat up getting on with some little requisites, lest
the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
sat she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard a noise in Angel's room overhead, a sound of thumping
and struggling. Everybody else in the house was asleep, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
anxiety lest Clare should be ill she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ran up and knocked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) door,
and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) what was the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said from within. <div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry I disturbed
you! But the reason is rather an amusing one: I fell asleep and
dreamt that I was fighting that fellow again who insulted you,
and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at
my portmanteau, which I pulled out to-day for packing. I am
occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep. Go to bed and
think of it no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
indecision. Declare the past to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) by word of mouth she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not;
but there was another way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sat down and wrote on the four pages
of a note-sheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four
years ago, put it into an envelope, and directed it to Clare. Then,
lest the flesh should again be weak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) crept upstairs without any
shoes and slipped the note under his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) door.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) night was a broken one, as it well might be, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) listened for
the first faint noise overhead. It came, as usual; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) descended, as
usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) descended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at the bottom of the stairs and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Surely it was as warmly as ever!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) looked a little disturbed and worn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said not
a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) revelation, even when they were alone. Could
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) have had it? Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) began the subject she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
say nothing. So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) meant to keep to himself. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was frank and
affectionate as before. Could it be that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) doubts were childish?
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
was, and smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) disquiet as at a foolish nightmare? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
really received her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) note? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) glanced into his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) room, and could see
nothing of it. It might be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). But even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had
not received it she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) surely
would forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>Every morning and night he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was the same, and thus New Year's Eve
broke--the wedding day.

<p/>The lovers did not rise at milking-time, having through the whole of
this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something
of the position of guests, Tess being honoured with a room of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
own. When they arrived downstairs at breakfast-time they were
surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large
kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it. At some
unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning
chimney-corner to be whitened, and the brick hearth reddened, and a
blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of
the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had
formerly done duty there. This renovated aspect of what was the
focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning threw a smiling
demeanour over the whole apartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was determined to do summat in honour o`t'' (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>, said the dairyman.
<div class="bookquote">``And as you wouldn't hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi'
fiddles and bass-viols complete, as we should ha' done in old times,
this was all I could think o' as a noiseless thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have
been present at the ceremony, even had any been asked; but as a fact
nobody was invited from Marlott. As for Angel's family, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had
written and duly informed them of the time, and assured them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
would like to come. His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) brothers had not replied at all, seeming
to be indignant with him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>); while his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father and mother had written
a rather sad letter, deploring his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) precipitancy in rushing into
marriage, but making the best of the matter by saying that, though
a dairywoman was the last daughter-in-law they could have expected,
their son had arrived at an age which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might be supposed to be the
best judge.

<p/>This coolness in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) relations distressed Clare less than it would
have done had he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) been without the grand card with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) meant to
surprise them ere long. To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as
a d``Urberville and a lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had felt to be temerarious and risky;
hence he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lineage till such time as, familiarized
with worldly ways by a few months' travel and reading with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
could take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on a visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) parents and impart the knowledge
while triumphantly producing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as worthy of such an ancient line.
It was a pretty lover's dream, if no more. Perhaps Tess's lineage
had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) perception that Angel's bearing towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) still remained in no
whit altered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own communication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) could have received it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rose from breakfast before he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had
finished, and hastened upstairs. It had occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to look once
more into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare's den, or rather
eyrie, for so long, and climbing the ladder she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stood at the open
door of the apartment, regarding and pondering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stooped to the
threshold of the doorway, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had pushed in the note two or
three days earlier in such excitement. The carpet reached close to
the sill, and under the edge of the carpet she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) discerned the faint
white margin of the envelope containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
obviously had never seen, owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) having in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) haste thrust it
beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door.

<p/>With a feeling of faintness she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) withdrew the letter. There it
was--sealed up, just as it had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hands. The mountain had
not yet been removed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) read it now, the house
being in full bustle of preparation; and descending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own room
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) destroyed the letter there.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was so pale when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) felt quite anxious.
The incident of the misplaced letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had jumped at as if it
prevented a confession; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) conscience that it need
not; there was still time. Yet everything was in a stir; there
was coming and going; all had to dress, the dairyman and Mrs Crick
having been asked to accompany them as witnesses; and reflection or
deliberate talk was well-nigh impossible. The only minute Tess could
get to be alone with Clare was when they met upon the landing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so anxious to talk to you--I want to confess all my faults and
blunders!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said with attempted lightness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no--we can't have faults talked of--you must be deemed perfect
to-day at least, my Sweet!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``We shall have plenty of time,
hereafter, I hope, to talk over our failings. I will confess mine at
the same time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it would be better for me to do it now, I think, so that you
could not say--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my quixotic one, you shall tell me anything--say, as soon as
we are settled in our lodging; not now. I, too, will tell you my
faults then. But do not let us spoil the day with them; they will
be excellent matter for a dull time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you don't wish me to, dearest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not, Tessy, really.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this.
Those words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) seemed to reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) on further reflection.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by
the mastering tide of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) devotion to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), which closed up further
meditation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) one desire, so long resisted, to make herself his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>),
to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lord, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own--then, if necessary, to die--had
at last lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) plodding reflective pathway. In
dressing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) moved about in a mental cloud of many-coloured
idealities, which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its
brightness.

<p/>The church was a long way off, and they were obliged to drive,
particularly as it was winter. A closed carriage was ordered from
a roadside inn, a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the
old days of post-chaise travelling. It had stout wheel-spokes, and
heavy felloes a great curved bed, immense straps and springs, and a
pole like a battering-ram. The postilion was a venerable <div class="bookquote">``boy''  (<font color='red'><b>The postilion</b></font>)</div>of
sixty--a martyr to rheumatic gout, the result of excessive exposure
in youth, counter-acted by strong liquors--who had stood at inn-doors
doing nothing for the whole five-and-twenty years that had elapsed
since he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) had no longer been required to ride professionally, as if
expecting the old times to come back again. He (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) had a permanent
running wound on the outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) right leg, originated by the
constant bruisings of aristocratic carriage-poles during the many
years that he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) had been in regular employ at the King's Arms,
Casterbridge.

<p/>Inside this cumbrous and creaking structure, and behind this decayed
conductor, the _partie carrée_ took their seats--the bride and
bridegroom and Mr and Mrs Crick. Angel would have liked one at least
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) brothers to be present as groomsman, but their silence after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified that they did
not care to come. They disapproved of the marriage, and could not be
expected to countenance it. Perhaps it was as well that they could
not be present. They were not worldly young fellows, but fraternizing
with dairy-folk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased
niceness, apart from their views of the match.

<p/>Upheld by the momentum of the time, Tess knew nothing of this, did
not see anything, did not know the road they were taking to the
church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew that Angel was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); all the rest was
a luminous mist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was a sort of celestial person, who owed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) being to poetry--one of those classical divinities Clare was
accustomed to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) about when they took their walks together.

<p/>The marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people
in the church; had there been a thousand they would have produced
no more effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). They were at stellar distances from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
present world. In the ecstatic solemnity with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) swore her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
faith to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy.
At a pause in the service, while they were kneeling together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
unconsciously inclined herself towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shoulder
touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been frightened by a passing thought, and
the movement had been automatic, to assure herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was really
there, and to fortify her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) belief that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fidelity would be proof
against all things.

<p/>Clare knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)--every curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) form showed that--
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not know at that time the full depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) devotion, its
single-mindedness, its meekness; what long-suffering it guaranteed,
what honesty, what endurance, what good faith.

<p/>As they came out of church the ringers swung the bells off their
rests, and a modest peal of three notes broke forth--that limited
amount of expression having been deemed sufficient by the church
builders for the joys of such a small parish. Passing by the tower
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband on the path to the gate she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could feel the vibrant
air humming round them from the louvred belfry in the circle of
sound, and it matched the highly-charged mental atmosphere in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was living.

<p/>This condition of mind, wherein she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt glorified by an irradiation
not her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own, like the angel whom St John saw in the sun, lasted till
the sound of the church bells had died away, and the emotions of the
wedding-service had calmed down. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes could dwell upon details
more clearly now, and Mr and Mrs Crick having directed their own gig
to be sent for them, to leave the carriage to the young couple, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>)
observed the build and character of that conveyance for the first
time. Sitting in silence she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) regarded it long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy you seem oppressed, Tessy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) answered, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) brow. <div class="bookquote">``I tremble at
many things. It is all so serious, Angel. Among other things I seem
to have seen this carriage before, to be very well acquainted with
it. It is very odd--I must have seen it in a dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh--you have heard the legend of the d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville Coach--that
well-known superstition of this county about your family when they
were very popular here; and this lumbering old thing reminds you of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never heard of it to my knowledge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What is the
legend--may I know it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well--I would rather not tell it in detail just now. A certain
d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a
dreadful crime in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) family coach; and since that time members of
the family see or hear the old coach whenever--But I'll tell you
another day--it is rather gloomy. Evidently some dim knowledge of
it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable
caravan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember hearing it before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Is it when we
are going to die, Angel, that members of my family see it, or is it
when we have committed a crime?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Tess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) silenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) by a kiss.

<p/>By the time they reached home she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) was contrite and spiritless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>)
was Mrs Angel Clare, indeed, but had she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) any moral right to the name?
Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) not more truly Mrs Alexander d``Urberville? Could intensity
of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable
reticence? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew not what was expected of women in such cases;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had no counsellor.

<p/>However, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found herself alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) room for a few
minutes--the last day this on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was ever to enter it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
knelt down and prayed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tried to pray to God, but it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
husband who really had her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) supplication. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) idolatry of this man
was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) herself almost feared it to be ill-omened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was
conscious of the notion expressed by Friar Laurence: <div class="bookquote">``These violent
delights have violent ends.''  (<font color='red'><b>Friar Laurence</b></font>)</div>It might be too desperate for human
conditions--too rank, to wild, too deadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O my love, why do I love you so!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) whispered there alone; <div class="bookquote">``for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) you love is not my real self, but one in my image; the one I
might have been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Afternoon came, and with it the hour for departure. They had decided
to fulfil the plan of going for a few days to the lodgings in the old
farmhouse near Wellbridge Mill, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) meant to reside during
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) investigation of flour processes. At two o'clock there was
nothing left to do but to start. All the servantry of the dairy were
standing in the red-brick entry to see them go out, the dairyman and
his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) wife following to the door. Tess saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) three chamber-mates
in a row against the wall, pensively inclining their heads. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had much questioned if they would appear at the parting moment; but
there they were, stoical and staunch to the last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew why the
delicate Retty looked so fragile, and Izz so tragically sorrowful,
and Marian so blank; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) own dogging shadow for a
moment in contemplating theirs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) impulsively whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you kiss 'em all, once, poor things, for the first and last
time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality--which
was all that it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)--and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) passed them he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) kissed them in
succession where they stood, saying <div class="bookquote">``Goodbye''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to each as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did so.
When they reached the door Tess femininely glanced back to discern
the effect of that kiss of charity; there was no triumph in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
glance, as there might have been. If there had it would have
disappeared when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw how moved the girls all were. The kiss had
obviously done harm by awakening feelings they were trying to subdue.

<p/>Of all this Clare was unconscious. Passing on to the wicket-gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
shook hands with the dairyman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife, and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) last
thanks to them for their attentions; after which there was a moment
of silence before they had moved off. It was interrupted by the
crowing of a cock. The white one with the rose comb had come and
settled on the palings in front of the house, within a few yards of
them, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) notes thrilled their ears through, dwindling away like
echoes down a valley of rocks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Crick</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Crick. <div class="bookquote">``An afternoon crow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>Two men were standing by the yard gate, holding it open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>one murmured to the other, not thinking that the words
could be heard by the group at the door-wicket.

<p/>The cock crew again--straight towards Clare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>said the dairyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Tell the man
to drive on. Goodbye, goodbye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The cock crew</b></font>)</div><p/>The cock crew again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hoosh! Just you be off, sir, or I'll twist your neck!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div>said the
dairyman with some irritation, turning to the bird and driving him (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>)
away. And to his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) wife as they went indoors: <div class="bookquote">``Now, to think o' that
just to-day! I've not heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) crow of an afternoon all the year
afore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It only means a change in the weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``not what you
think: `tis impossible!''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXIV


<p/>They drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few
miles, and, reaching Wellbridge, turned away from the village to the
left, and over the great Elizabethan bridge which gives the place
half its name. Immediately behind it stood the house wherein they
had engaged lodgings, whose exterior features are so well known to
all travellers through the Froom Valley; once portion of a fine
manorial residence, and the property and seat of a d``Urberville, but
since its partial demolition a farmhouse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome to one of your ancestral mansions!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) handed
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) down. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) regretted the pleasantry; it was too near a satire.

<p/>On entering they found that, though they had only engaged a couple
of rooms, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence
during the coming days to pay a New Year's visit to some friends,
leaving a woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their
few wants. The absoluteness of possession pleased them, and they
realized it as the first moment of their experience under their own
exclusive roof-tree.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>)
bride. When the carriage was gone they ascended the stairs to wash
their hands, the charwoman showing the way. On the landing Tess
stopped and started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those horrid women!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``How they
frightened me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) looked up, and perceived two life-size portraits on panels built
into the masonry. As all visitors to the mansion are aware, these
paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred
years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten.
The long pointed features, narrow eye, and smirk of the one, so
suggestive of merciless treachery; the bill-hook nose, large
teeth, and bold eye of the other suggesting arrogance to the point
of ferocity, haunt the beholder afterwards in his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) dreams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose portraits are those?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>asked Clare of the charwoman.

<p/>``I have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the
d``Urberville family, the ancient lords of this manor,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Owing to their being builded into the wall they can't be moved
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lords</b></font>)</div><p/>The unpleasantness of the matter was that, in addition to their
effect upon Tess, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fine features were unquestionably traceable
in these exaggerated forms. He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) said nothing of this, however, and,
regretting that he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) had gone out of his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) way to choose the house for
their bridal time, went on into the adjoining room. The place having
been rather hastily prepared for them, they washed their hands in one
basin. Clare touched hers under the water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which are my fingers and which are yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, looking up.
<div class="bookquote">``They are very much mixed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are all yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), very prettily, and endeavoured
to be gayer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had not been displeased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
thoughtfulness on such an occasion; it was what every sensible woman
would show: but Tess knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been thoughtful to excess,
and struggled against it.

<p/>The sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it
shone in through a small opening and formed a golden staff which
stretched across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) skirt, where it made a spot like a paint-mark
set upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). They went into the ancient parlour to tea, and
here they shared their first common meal alone. Such was their
childishness, or rather his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found it interesting to use the
same bread-and-butter plate as herself, and to brush crumbs from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wondered a little that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not enter into
these frivolities with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own zest.

<p/>Looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) silently for a long time; <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is a dear dear Tess,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of
a difficult passage. <div class="bookquote">``Do I realize solemnly enough how utterly and
irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good
or bad faith and fortune? I think not. I think I could not, unless
I were a woman myself. What I am in worldly estate, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is. What I
become, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must become. What I cannot be, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot be. And shall
I ever neglect her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or even forget to consider her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? God
forbid such a crime!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dairyman</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat on over the tea-table waiting for their luggage, which the
dairyman had promised to send before it grew dark. But evening began
to close in, and the luggage did not arrive, and they had brought
nothing more than they stood in. With the departure of the sun the
calm mood of the winter day changed. Out of doors there began noises
as of silk smartly rubbed; the restful dead leaves of the preceding
autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection, and whirled about
unwillingly, and tapped against the shutters. It soon began to rain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That cock knew the weather was going to change,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare.

<p/>The woman who had attended upon them had gone home for the night, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had placed candles upon the table, and now they lit them. Each
candle-flame drew towards the fireplace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These old houses are so draughty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>continued Angel, looking at the
flames, and at the grease guttering down the sides. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder where
that luggage is. We haven't even a brush and comb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered, absent-minded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess, you are not a bit cheerful this evening--not at all as you
used to be. Those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled
you. I am sorry I brought you here. I wonder if you really love me,
after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did, and the words had no serious intent; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was surcharged with emotion, and winced like a wounded animal.
Though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried not to shed tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not help showing one
or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>), sorry. <div class="bookquote">``You are worried at not having
your things, I know. I cannot think why old Jonathan has not come
with them. Why, it is seven o'clock? Ah, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>A knock had come to the door, and, there being nobody else to answer
it, Clare went out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) returned to the room with a small package in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not Jonathan, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How vexing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/>The packet had been brought by a special messenger, who had arrived
at Talbothays from Emminster Vicarage immediately after the departure
of the married couple, and had followed them hither, being under
injunction to deliver it into nobody's hands but theirs. Clare
brought it to the light. It was less than a foot long, sewed up in
canvas, sealed in red wax with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father's seal, and directed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
father's hand to <div class="bookquote">``Mrs Angel Clare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a little wedding-present for you, Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), handing it
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How thoughtful they are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess looked a little flustered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) took it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I would rather have you open it, dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), turning
over the parcel. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like to break those great seals; they look
so serious. Please open it for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) undid the parcel. Inside was a case of morocco leather, on the
top of which lay a note and a key.

<p/>The note was for Clare, in the following words:


<p/>MY DEAR SON--

<p/>Possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your
godmother, Mrs Pitney, when you were a lad, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>)--vain,
kind woman that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was--left to me a portion of the
contents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) jewel-case in trust for your wife, if
you should ever have one, as a mark of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) affection
for you and whomsoever you should choose. This trust
I have fulfilled, and the diamonds have been locked up
at my banker's ever since. Though I feel it to be a
somewhat incongruous act in the circumstances, I am, as
you will see, bound to hand over the articles to the
woman to whom the use of them for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lifetime will now
rightly belong, and they are therefore promptly sent.
They become, I believe, heirlooms, strictly speaking,
according to the terms of your godmother's will. The
precise words of the clause that refers to this matter
are enclosed.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare; <div class="bookquote">``but I had quite forgotten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Unlocking the case, they found it to contain a necklace, with
pendant, bracelets, and ear-rings; and also some other small
ornaments.

<p/>Tess seemed afraid to touch them at first, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes sparkled for
a moment as much as the stones when Clare spread out the set.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked incredulously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) looked into the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) remembered how, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was a lad of
fifteen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) godmother, the Squire's wife--the only rich person
with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had ever come in contact--had pinned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) faith to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
success; had prophesied a wondrous career for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). There had seemed
nothing at all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the
storing up of these showy ornaments for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife and the wives of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) descendants. They gleamed somewhat ironically now. <div class="bookquote">``Yet why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) asked himself. It was but a question of vanity throughout; and
if that were admitted into one side of the equation it should be
admitted into the other. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife was a d``Urberville: whom could
they become better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)?

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said with enthusiasm--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess, put them on--put them on!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) turned from the fire to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>But as if by magic she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had already donned them--necklace, ear-rings,
bracelets, and all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the gown isn't right, Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare. <div class="bookquote">``It ought to be a low
one for a set of brilliants like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) how to tuck in the upper edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bodice, so
as to make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear; and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had done this, and the pendant to the necklace hung isolated
amid the whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) throat, as it was designed to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
stepped back to survey her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My heavens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare, <div class="bookquote">``how beautiful you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>As everybody knows, fine feathers make fine birds; a peasant girl but
very moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) simple
condition and attire will bloom as an amazing beauty if clothed as a
woman of fashion with the aids that Art can render; while the beauty
of the midnight crush would often cut but a sorry figure if placed
inside the field-woman's wrapper upon a monotonous acreage of
turnips on a dull day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had never till now estimated the artistic
excellence of Tess's limbs and features.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were only to appear in a ball-room!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But
no--no, dearest; I think I love you best in the wing-bonnet and
cotton-frock--yes, better than in this, well as you support these
dignities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) striking appearance had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) a flush of
excitement, which was yet not happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take them off,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``in case Jonathan should see me.
They are not fit for me, are they? They must be sold, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let them stay a few minutes longer. Sell them? Never. It would be
a breach of faith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Influenced by a second thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) readily obeyed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had something
to tell, and there might be help in these. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sat down with the
jewels upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); and they again indulged in conjectures as to where
Jonathan could possibly be with their baggage. The ale they had
poured out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) consumption when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) came had gone flat with long
standing.

<p/>Shortly after this they began supper, which was already laid on
a side-table. Ere they had finished there was a jerk in the
fire-smoke, the rising skein of which bulged out into the room, as if
some giant had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) hand on the chimney-top for a moment. It had
been caused by the opening of the outer door. A heavy step was now
heard in the passage, and Angel went out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn' make nobody hear at all by knocking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jonathan/Jonathan Kail</b></font>)</div>apologized Jonathan
Kail, for it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>) at last; <div class="bookquote">``and as't was raining out I opened the
door. I've brought the things, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to see them. But you are very late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jonathan/Jonathan Kail</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something subdued in Jonathan Kail's tone which had not
been there in the day, and lines of concern were ploughed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>)
forehead in addition to the lines of years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>) continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha' been a most
terrible affliction since you and your Mis`ess--so to name her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
now--left us this a`ternoon. Perhaps you ha`nt forgot the cock's
afternoon crow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me;--what--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, some says it do mane one thing, and some another; but what's
happened is that poor little Retty Priddle hev tried to drown
herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Really! Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bade us goodbye with the rest--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Well, sir, when you and your Mis`ess--so to name what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
lawful is--when you two drove away, as I say, Retty and Marian put on
their bonnets and went out; and as there is not much doing now, being
New Year's Eve, and folks mops and brooms from what's inside 'em,
nobody took much notice. They went on to Lew-Everard, where they
had summut to drink, and then on they vamped to Dree-armed Cross,
and there they seemed to have parted, Retty striking across the
water-meads as if for home, and Marian going on to the next village,
where there's another public-house. Nothing more was zeed or heard
o' Retty till the waterman, on his (<font color='blue'><b>waterman</b></font>) way home, noticed something by the
Great Pool; 'twas her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) bonnet and shawl packed up. In the water he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) and another man brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) home, thinking a' was
dead; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) fetched round by degrees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Angel, suddenly recollecting that Tess was overhearing this gloomy
tale, went to shut the door between the passage and the ante-room
to the inner parlour where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wife, flinging a shawl
round her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), had come to the outer room and was listening to the man's
narrative, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes resting absently on the luggage and the drops of
rain glistening upon it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, more than this, there's Marian; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)'s been found dead drunk
by the withy-bed--a girl who hev never been known to touch anything
before except shilling ale; though, to be sure, 'a was always a good
trencher-woman, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) face showed. It seems as if the maids had
all gone out o' their minds!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Izz?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>asked Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Izz is about house as usual; but 'a do say 'a can guess how it
happened; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) seems to be very low in mind about it, poor maid,
as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) mid be. And so you see, sir, as all this happened just
when we was packing your few traps and your Mis`ess's night-rail and
dressing things into the cart, why, it belated me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Well, Jonathan, will you get the trunks upstairs, and drink a
cup of ale, and hasten back as soon as you can, in case you should be
wanted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess had gone back to the inner parlour, and sat down by the fire,
looking wistfully into it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard Jonathan Kail's heavy footsteps
up and down the stairs till he (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>) had done placing the luggage, and
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>) express his (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>) thanks for the ale her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband took out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>),
and for the gratuity he (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>) received. Jonathan's footsteps then died
from the door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kail</b></font>) cart creaked away.

<p/>Angel slid forward the massive oak bar which secured the door, and
coming in to where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sat over the hearth, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheeks
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) hands from behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to jump up gaily and
unpack the toilet-gear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been so anxious about, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
did not rise he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) sat down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in the firelight, the candles on
the supper-table being too thin and glimmering to interfere with its
glow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry you should have heard this sad story about the girls,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Still, don't let it depress you. Retty was naturally
morbid, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without the least cause,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess. <div class="bookquote">``While they who have cause to
be, hide it, and pretend they are not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>This incident had turned the scale for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). They were simple and
innocent girls on whom the unhappiness of unrequited love had fallen;
they had deserved better at the hands of Fate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had deserved
worse--yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was the chosen one. It was wicked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to take all
without paying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would pay to the uttermost farthing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would
tell, there and then. This final determination she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came to when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
looked into the fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand.

<p/>A steady glare from the now flameless embers painted the sides
and back of the fireplace with its colour, and the well-polished
andirons, and the old brass tongs that would not meet. The underside
of the mantel-shelf was flushed with the high-coloured light, and
the legs of the table nearest the fire. Tess's face and neck
reflected the same warmth, which each gem turned into an Aldebaran
or a Sirius--a constellation of white, red, and green flashes, that
interchanged their hues with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) every pulsation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember what we said to each other this morning about
telling our faults?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked abruptly, finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) still
remained immovable. <div class="bookquote">``We spoke lightly perhaps, and you may well
have done so. But for me it was no light promise. I want to make
a confession to you, Love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>This, from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), so unexpectedly apposite, had the effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) of
a Providential interposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have to confess something?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said quickly, and even with
gladness and relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not expect it? Ah--you thought too highly of me. Now
listen. Put your head there, because I want you to forgive me, and
not to be indignant with me for not telling you before, as perhaps
I ought to have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>How strange it was! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seemed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) double. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not speak,
and Clare went on--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mention it because I was afraid of endangering my chance
of you, darling, the great prize of my life--my Fellowship I call
you. My brother's Fellowship was won at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) college, mine at
Talbothays Dairy. Well, I would not risk it. I was going to tell
you a month ago--at the time you agreed to be mine, but I could not;
I thought it might frighten you away from me. I put it off; then I
thought I would tell you yesterday, to give you a chance at least of
escaping me. But I did not. And I did not this morning, when you
proposed our confessing our faults on the landing--the sinner that I
was! But I must, now I see you sitting there so solemnly. I wonder
if you will forgive me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes! I am sure that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, I hope so. But wait a minute. You don't know. To begin at
the beginning. Though I imagine my poor father fears that I am one
of the eternally lost for my doctrines, I am of course, a believer in
good morals, Tess, as much as you. I used to wish to be a teacher of
men, and it was a great disappointment to me when I found I could not
enter the Church. I admired spotlessness, even though I could lay no
claim to it, and hated impurity, as I hope I do now. Whatever one
may think of plenary inspiration, one must heartily subscribe to
these words of Paul: ``Be thou an example--in word, in conversation,
in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.<div class="bookquote">'' It is the only
safeguard for us poor human beings. '_Integer vitae_,''  (<font color='red'><b>a poet company</b></font>)</div>says a Roman
poet, who is strange company for St Paul--


<p/>``The man of upright life, from frailties free,
Stands not in need of Moorish spear or bow.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, a certain place is paved with good intentions, and having felt
all that so strongly, you will see what a terrible remorse it bred
in me when, in the midst of my fine aims for other people, I myself
fell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) of that time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life to which allusion has been
made when, tossed about by doubts and difficulties in London, like a
cork on the waves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) plunged into eight-and-forty hours' dissipation
with a stranger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happily I awoke almost immediately to a sense of my folly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
continued. <div class="bookquote">``I would have no more to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and I came home. I
have never repeated the offence. But I felt I should like to treat
you with perfect frankness and honour, and I could not do so without
telling this. Do you forgive me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) hand tightly for an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we will dismiss it at once and for ever!--too painful as it is
for the occasion--and talk of something lighter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Angel--I am almost glad--because now YOU can forgive ME! I have
not made my confession. I have a confession, too--remember, I said
so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to be sure! Now then for it, wicked little one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, although you smile, it is as serious as yours, or more so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can hardly be more serious, dearest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot--O no, it cannot!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) jumped up joyfully at the hope.
<div class="bookquote">``No, it cannot be more serious, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``because `tis
just the same! I will tell you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sat down again.

<p/>Their hands were still joined. The ashes under the grate were lit
by the fire vertically, like a torrid waste. Imagination might have
beheld a Last Day luridness in this red-coaled glow, which fell on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) face and hand, and on hers, peering into the loose hair about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
brow, and firing the delicate skin underneath. A large shadow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
shape rose upon the wall and ceiling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bent forward, at which
each diamond on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) neck gave a sinister wink like a toad's; and
pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) forehead against his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) temple she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) entered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) story of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) acquaintance with Alec d``Urberville and its results, murmuring
the words without flinching, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyelids drooping down.


<p/>END OF PHASE THE FOURTH





<p/>Phase the Fifth: The Woman Pays



<p/>XXXV


<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) narrative ended; even its re-assertions and secondary
explanations were done. Tess's voice throughout had hardly risen
higher than its opening tone; there had been no exculpatory phrase of
any kind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not wept.

<p/>But the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer
transmutation as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) announcement progressed. The fire in the grate
looked impish--demoniacally funny, as if it did not care in the least
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) strait. The fender grinned idly, as if it too did not
care. The light from the water-bottle was merely engaged in a
chromatic problem. All material objects around announced their
irresponsibility with terrible iteration. And yet nothing had
changed since the moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); or rather,
nothing in the substance of things. But the essence of things had
changed.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ceased, the auricular impressions from their previous
endearments seemed to hustle away into the corner of their brains,
repeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind
foolishness.

<p/>Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire; the
intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). After
stirring the embers he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) feet; all the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
disclosure had imparted itself now. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) face had withered. In the
strenuousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) concentration he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) treadled fitfully on the floor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not, by any contrivance, think closely enough; that was the
meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) vague movement. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) spoke it was in the most
inadequate, commonplace voice of the many varied tones she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had heard
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dearest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to believe this? From your manner I am to take it as true.
O you cannot be out of your mind! You ought to be! Yet you are
not... My wife, my Tess--nothing in you warrants such a supposition
as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not out of my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) looked vacantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), to resume with dazed senses:
<div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell me before? Ah, yes, you would have told me, in a
way--but I hindered you, I remember!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>These and other of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) words were nothing but the perfunctory babble
of the surface while the depths remained paralyzed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) turned away,
and bent over a chair. Tess followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) to the middle of the room,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) was, and stood there staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) with eyes that did not
weep. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) slid down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knees beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) foot, and
from this position she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) crouched in a heap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the name of our love, forgive me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) whispered with a dry
mouth. <div class="bookquote">``I have forgiven you for the same!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) did not answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me as you are forgiven! _I_ forgive YOU, Angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You--yes, you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do not forgive me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case! You were one
person; now you are another. My God--how can forgiveness meet such
a grotesque--prestidigitation as that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) paused, contemplating this definition; then suddenly broke into
horrible laughter--as unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't--don't! It kills me quite, that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shrieked. <div class="bookquote">``O have
mercy upon me--have mercy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) did not answer; and, sickly white, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) jumped up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel, Angel! what do you mean by that laugh?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried out. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you know what this is to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been hoping, longing, praying, to make you happy! I have
thought what joy it will be to do it, what an unworthy wife I shall
be if I do not! That's what I have felt, Angel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, Angel, that you loved me--me, my very self! If it is
I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so? It
frightens me! Having begun to love you, I love you for ever--in all
changes, in all disgraces, because you are yourself. I ask no more.
Then how can you, O my own husband, stop loving me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I repeat, the woman I have been loving is not you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another woman in your shape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) perceived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) words the realization of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own apprehensive
foreboding in former times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as a species of
imposter; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one. Terror was
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) white face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw it; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek was flaccid, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole. The horrible
sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) so deadened her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) staggered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>)
stepped forward, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was going to fall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) said gently. <div class="bookquote">``You are ill; and it is
natural that you should be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did sit down, without knowing where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, that strained look
still upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes such as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) flesh creep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't belong to you any more, then; do I, Angel?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked
helplessly. <div class="bookquote">``It is not me, but another woman like me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) loved,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The image raised caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to take pity upon herself as one who was
ill-used. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes filled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) position further; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
turned round and burst into a flood of self-sympathetic tears.

<p/>Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) of what had
happened was beginning to be a trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) only less than the
woe of the disclosure itself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) waited patiently, apathetically,
till the violence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) grief had worn itself out, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rush of
weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said suddenly, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) natural tones, the insane, dry
voice of terror having left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) now. <div class="bookquote">``Angel, am I too wicked for
you and me to live together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not been able to think what we can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't ask you to let me live with you, Angel, because I have
no right to! I shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be
married, as I said I would do; and I shan't finish the good-hussif'
I cut out and meant to make while we were in lodgings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't do anything, unless you order me to; and if you go away
from me I shall not follow `ee; and if you never speak to me any more
I shall not ask why, unless you tell me I may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I order you to do anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will obey you like your wretched slave, even if it is to lie down
and die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good. But it strikes me that there is a want of
harmony between your present mood of self-sacrifice and your past
mood of self-preservation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>These were the first words of antagonism. To fling elaborate
sarcasms at Tess, however, was much like flinging them at a dog or
cat. The charms of their subtlety passed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) unappreciated, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger
ruled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) remained mute, not knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was smothering his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hardly observed that a tear descended slowly
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek, a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the
skin over which it rolled, like the object lens of a microscope.
Meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
confession had wrought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) universe, returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tried desperately to advance among the new conditions in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stood. Some consequent action was necessary; yet what?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, as gently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could speak, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot stay--in this
room--just now. I will walk out a little way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) quietly left the room, and the two glasses of wine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
poured out for their supper--one for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), one for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--remained on
the table untasted. This was what their _agape_ had come to. At
tea, two or three hours earlier, they had, in the freakishness of
affection, drunk from one cup.

<p/>The closing of the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), gently as it had been pulled
to, roused Tess from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stupor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was gone; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not stay.
Hastily flinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cloak around her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) opened the door and
followed, putting out the candles as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) were never coming back.
The rain was over and the night was now clear.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was soon close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heels, for Clare walked slowly and without
purpose. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) form beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) light gray figure looked black,
sinister, and forbidding, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt as sarcasm the touch of the
jewels of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been momentarily so proud. Clare turned at
hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) footsteps, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) recognition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) presence seemed
to make no difference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went on over the five yawning
arches of the great bridge in front of the house.

<p/>The cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water, the rain
having been enough to charge them, but not enough to wash them away.
Across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick
transit as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) passed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would not have known they were shining
overhead if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not seen them there--the vastest things of the
universe imaged in objects so mean.

<p/>The place to which they had travelled to-day was in the same
valley as Talbothays, but some miles lower down the river; and the
surroundings being open, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) kept easily in sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). Away from
the house the road wound through the meads, and along these she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
followed Clare without any attempt to come up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) or to attract
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), but with dumb and vacant fidelity.

<p/>At last, however, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) listless walk brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) up alongside him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and
still he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said nothing. The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great
after enlightenment, and it was mighty in Clare now. The outdoor air
had apparently taken away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) all tendency to act on impulse;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) without irradiation--in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bareness;
that Time was chanting his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) satiric psalm at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) then--


<p/>Behold, when thy face is made bare, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) that loved thee
shall hate;
Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate.
For thy life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain;
And the veil of thine head shall be grief, and the crown
shall be pain.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was still intently thinking, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) companionship had now
insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought. What a
weak thing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) presence must have become to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not help
addressing Clare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I done--what HAVE I done! I have not told of anything
that interferes with or belies my love for you. You don't think I
planned it, do you? It is in your own mind what you are angry at,
Angel; it is not in me. O, it is not in me, and I am not that
deceitful woman you think me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm--well. Not deceitful, my wife; but not the same. No, not the
same. But do not make me reproach you. I have sworn that I will
not; and I will do everything to avoid it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went on pleading in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) distraction; and perhaps said things
that would have been better left to silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel!--Angel! I was a child--a child when it happened! I knew
nothing of men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were more sinned against than sinning, that I admit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then will you not forgive me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do forgive you, but forgiveness is not all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To this question he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Angel--my mother says that it sometimes happens so!--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knows
several cases where they were worse than I, and the husband has not
minded it much--has got over it at least. And yet the woman had not
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as I do you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, Tess; don't argue. Different societies, different manners.
You almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman, who
have never been initiated into the proportions of social things.
You don't know what you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am only a peasant by position, not by nature!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) spoke with an impulse to anger, but it went as it came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the worse for you. I think that parson who unearthed your
pedigree would have done better if he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had held his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) tongue. I cannot
help associating your decline as a family with this other fact--of
your want of firmness. Decrepit families imply decrepit wills,
decrepit conduct. Heaven, why did you give me a handle for despising
you more by informing me of your descent! Here was I thinking you a
new-sprung child of nature; there were you, the belated seedling of
an effete aristocracy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lots of families are as bad as mine in that! Retty's family were
once large landowners, and so were Dairyman Billett's. And the
Debbyhouses, who now are carters, were once the De Bayeux family.
You find such as I everywhere; `tis a feature of our county, and I
can't help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the worse for the county.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) took these reproaches in their bulk simply, not in their
particulars; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hitherto, and
to all else she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was indifferent.

<p/>They wandered on again in silence. It was said afterwards that a
cottager of Wellbridge, who went out late that night for a doctor,
met two lovers in the pastures, walking very slowly, without
converse, one behind the other, as in a funeral procession, and the
glimpse that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) obtained of their faces seemed to denote that they
were anxious and sad. Returning later, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) passed them again in the
same field, progressing just as slowly, and as regardless of the hour
and of the cheerless night as before. It was only on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
preoccupation with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own affairs, and the illness in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) house,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not bear in mind the curious incident, which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
recalled a long while after.

<p/>During the interval of the cottager's going and coming, she (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) had said
to her (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) husband--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how I can help being the cause of much misery to you all
your life. The river is down there. I can put an end to myself in
it. I am not afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to add murder to my other follies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will leave something to show that I did it myself--on account of
my shame. They will not blame you then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak so absurdly--I wish not to hear it. It is nonsense
to have such thoughts in this kind of case, which is rather one
for satirical laughter than for tragedy. You don't in the least
understand the quality of the mishap. It would be viewed in the
light of a joke by nine-tenths of the world if it were known. Please
oblige me by returning to the house, and going to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) dutifully.

<p/>They had rambled round by a road which led to the well-known ruins of
the Cistercian abbey behind the mill, the latter having, in centuries
past, been attached to the monastic establishment. The mill still
worked on, food being a perennial necessity; the abbey had perished,
creeds being transient. One continually sees the ministration of the
temporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal. Their walk
having been circuitous, they were still not far from the house, and
in obeying his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) direction she (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) only had to reach the large stone bridge
across the main river and follow the road for a few yards. When she (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>)
got back, everything remained as she (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) had left it, the fire being
still burning. She (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) did not stay downstairs for more than a minute,
but proceeded to her (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) chamber, whither the luggage had been taken.
Here she (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) sat down on the edge of the bed, looking blankly around,
and presently began to undress. In removing the light towards the
bedstead its rays fell upon the tester of white dimity; something was
hanging beneath it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) lifted the candle to see what it was.
A bough of mistletoe. Angel had put it there; she (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) knew that in an
instant. This was the explanation of that mysterious parcel which it
had been so difficult to pack and bring; whose contents he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would not
explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>), saying that time would soon show her (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) the purpose
thereof. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) zest and his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) gaiety he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had hung it there. How
foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked now.

<p/>Having nothing more to fear, having scarce anything to hope, for that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would relent there seemed no promise whatever, she (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) lay down dully.
When sorrow ceases to be speculative, sleep sees her (<font color='blue'><b>cottager</b></font>) opportunity.
Among so many happier moods which forbid repose this was a mood which
welcomed it, and in a few minutes the lonely Tess forgot existence,
surrounded by the aromatic stillness of the chamber that had once,
possibly, been the bride-chamber of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own ancestry.

<p/>Later on that night Clare also retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) steps to the house.
Entering softly to the sitting-room he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) obtained a light, and with the
manner of one who had considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) course he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) rugs upon
the old horse-hair sofa which stood there, and roughly shaped it to
a sleeping-couch. Before lying down he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) crept shoeless upstairs, and
listened at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) apartment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) measured breathing told
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was sleeping profoundly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>murmured Clare; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was conscious of a pang of
bitterness at the thought--approximately true, though not wholly
so--that having shifted the burden of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) shoulders, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
was now reposing without care.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) turned away to descend; then, irresolute, faced round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
door again. In the act he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) caught sight of one of the d``Urberville
dames, whose portrait was immediately over the entrance to Tess's
bedchamber. In the candlelight the painting was more than
unpleasant. Sinister design lurked in the woman's features, a
concentrated purpose of revenge on the other sex--so it seemed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) then. The Caroline bodice of the portrait was low--precisely as
Tess's had been when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tucked it in to show the necklace; and again
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between
them.

<p/>The check was sufficient. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) retreat and descended.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) air remained calm and cold, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) small compressed mouth indexing
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) powers of self-control; his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face wearing still that terrible
sterile expression which had spread thereon since her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) disclosure.
It was the face of a man who was no longer passion's slave, yet who
found no advantage in his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) enfranchisement. He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was simply regarding
the harrowing contingencies of human experience, the unexpectedness
of things. Nothing so pure, so sweet, so virginal as Tess had seemed
possible all the long while that he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) had adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), up to an hour
ago; but


<p/>The little less, and what worlds away!


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) argued erroneously when he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) said to himself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart was not
indexed in the honest freshness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face; but Tess had no advocate
to set him (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) right. Could it be possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) continued, that eyes
which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the
tongue was telling, were yet ever seeing another world behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
ostensible one, discordant and contrasting?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) reclined on his (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) couch in the sitting-room, and extinguished the
light. The night came in, and took up its place there, unconcerned
and indifferent; the night which had already swallowed up his (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>)
happiness, and was now digesting it listlessly; and was ready to
swallow up the happiness of a thousand other people with as little
disturbance or change of mien.



<p/>XXXVI


<p/>Clare arose in the light of a dawn that was ashy and furtive, as
though associated with crime. The fireplace confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) with its
extinct embers; the spread supper-table, whereon stood the two full
glasses of untasted wine, now flat and filmy; her (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) vacated seat and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own; the other articles of furniture, with their eternal look of
not being able to help it, their intolerable inquiry what was to be
done? From above there was no sound; but in a few minutes there came
a knock at the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) remembered that it would be the neighbouring
cottager's wife, who was to minister to their wants while they
remained here.

<p/>The presence of a third person in the house would be extremely
awkward just now, and, being already dressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) opened the window
and informed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that they could manage to shift for themselves that
morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had a milk-can in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand, which he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to leave
at the door. When the dame had gone away he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) searched in the back
quarters of the house for fuel, and speedily lit a fire. There was
plenty of eggs, butter, bread, and so on in the larder, and Clare
soon had breakfast laid, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) experiences at the dairy having rendered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) facile in domestic preparations. The smoke of the kindled wood
rose from the chimney without like a lotus-headed column; local
people who were passing by saw it, and thought of the newly-married
couple, and envied their happiness.

<p/>Angel cast a final glance round, and then going to the foot of the
stairs, called in a conventional voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Breakfast is ready!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) opened the front door, and took a few steps in the morning air.
When, after a short space, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) came back she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was already in the
sitting-room mechanically readjusting the breakfast things. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
was fully attired, and the interval since his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been
but two or three minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) must have been dressed or nearly so
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went to summon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hair was twisted up in a large
round mass at the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had put on one of the
new frocks--a pale blue woollen garment with neck-frillings of
white. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hands and face appeared to be cold, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had possibly
been sitting dressed in the bedroom a long time without any fire.
The marked civility of Clare's tone in calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seemed to have
inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), for the moment, with a new glimmer of hope. But it
soon died when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>The pair were, in truth, but the ashes of their former fires. To the
hot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness; it seemed
as if nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any
more.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) spoke gently to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) replied with a like
undemonstrativeness. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), looking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
sharply-defined face as one who had no consciousness that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own
formed a visible object also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, and paused, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fingers lightly
as a breeze, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could hardly believe to be there in the
flesh the man who was once her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lover. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes were bright, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pale
cheek still showed its wonted roundness, though half-dried tears had
left glistening traces thereon; and the usually ripe red mouth was
almost as pale as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek. Throbbingly alive as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was still,
under the stress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mental grief the life beat so brokenly that
a little further pull upon it would cause real illness, dull her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
characteristic eyes, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth thin.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked absolutely pure. Nature, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fantastic trickery, had
set such a seal of maidenhood upon Tess's countenance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gazed
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with a stupefied air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess! Say it is not true! No, it is not true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) imploringly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would willingly have taken a
lie from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips, knowing it to be one, and have made of it, by some
sort of sophistry, a valid denial. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) only repeated--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) living?''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>Angel then asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The baby died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>A last despair passed over Clare's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) took a few vague steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My position--is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``I thought--any man would
have thought--that by giving up all ambition to win a wife with
social standing, with fortune, with knowledge of the world, I should
secure rustic innocence as surely as I should secure pink cheeks;
but--However, I am no man to reproach you, and I will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) position so entirely that the remainder had not been
needed. Therein lay just the distress of it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had
lost all round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel--I should not have let it go on to marriage with you if I had
not known that, after all, there was a last way out of it for you;
though I hoped you would never--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) voice grew husky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A last way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, to get rid of me. You CAN get rid of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By divorcing me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens--how can you be so simple! How can I divorce you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you--now I have told you? I thought my confession would give
you grounds for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Tess--you are too, too--childish--unformed--crude, I suppose! I
don't know what you are. You don't understand the law--you don't
understand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--you cannot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>listener</b></font>)</div><p/>A quick shame mixed with the misery upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) listener's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought--I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``O, now I see how wicked I
seem to you! Believe me--believe me, on my soul, I never thought but
that you could! I hoped you would not; yet I believed, without a
doubt, that you could cast me off if you were determined, and didn't
love me at--at--all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, then I ought to have done it, to have done it last night! But I
hadn't the courage. That's just like me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The courage to do what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) by the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you thinking of doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of putting an end to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) writhed under this inquisitorial manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Last night,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Under your mistletoe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good--! How?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) asked sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you, if you won't be angry with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, shrinking.
<div class="bookquote">``It was with the cord of my box. But I could not--do the last thing!
I was afraid that it might cause a scandal to your name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The unexpected quality of this confession, wrung from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and not
volunteered, shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) perceptibly. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) still held her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and,
letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) glance fall from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face downwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Now,
listen to this. You must not dare to think of such a horrible thing!
How could you! You will promise me as your husband to attempt that
no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready to promise. I saw how wicked it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wicked! The idea was unworthy of you beyond description.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pleaded, enlarging her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes in calm unconcern upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it was thought of entirely on your account--to set you free
without the scandal of the divorce that I thought you would have to
get. I should never have dreamt of doing it on mine. However, to
do it with my own hand is too good for me, after all. It is you, my
ruined husband, who ought to strike the blow. I think I should love
you more, if that were possible, if you could bring yourself to do
it, since there's no other way of escape for `ee. I feel I am so
utterly worthless! So very greatly in the way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ssh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, since you say no, I won't. I have no wish opposed to yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knew this to be true enough. Since the desperation of the night
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) activities had dropped to zero, and there was no further rashness
to be feared.

<p/>Tess tried to busy herself again over the breakfast-table with more
or less success, and they sat down both on the same side, so that
their glances did not meet. There was at first something awkward
in hearing each other eat and drink, but this could not be escaped;
moreover, the amount of eating done was small on both sides.
Breakfast over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) rose, and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) the hour at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) might
be expected to dinner, went off to the miller's in a mechanical
pursuance of the plan of studying that business, which had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
only practical reason for coming here.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was gone Tess stood at the window, and presently saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) form
crossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sank behind it, crossed the railway beyond, and disappeared.
Then, without a sigh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) attention to the room, and began
clearing the table and setting it in order.

<p/>The charwoman soon came. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) presence was at first a strain upon
Tess, but afterwards an alleviation. At half-past twelve she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) assistant alone in the kitchen, and, returning to the
sitting-room, waited for the reappearance of Angel's form behind the
bridge.

<p/>About one he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) showed himself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face flushed, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was a
quarter of a mile off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ran to the kitchen to get the dinner
served by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) should enter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) went first to the room where
they had washed their hands together the day before, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
entered the sitting-room the dish-covers rose from the dishes as if
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) own motion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How punctual!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I saw you coming over the bridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>The meal was passed in commonplace talk of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had been doing
during the morning at the Abbey Mill, of the methods of bolting and
the old-fashioned machinery, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) feared would not enlighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
greatly on modern improved methods, some of it seeming to have been
in use ever since the days it ground for the monks in the adjoining
conventual buildings--now a heap of ruins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) left the house again
in the course of an hour, coming home at dusk, and occupying himself
through the evening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) papers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) feared she (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was in the way
and, when the old woman was gone, retired to the kitchen, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
made herself busy as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could for more than an hour.

<p/>Clare's shape appeared at the door. <div class="bookquote">``You must not work like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``You are not my servant; you are my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, and brightened somewhat. <div class="bookquote">``I may think myself
that--indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured, in piteous raillery. <div class="bookquote">``You mean in name!
Well, I don't want to be anything more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You MAY think so, Tess! You are. What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said hastily, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) accents. <div class="bookquote">``I
thought I--because I am not respectable, I mean. I told you I
thought I was not respectable enough long ago--and on that account
I didn't want to marry you, only--only you urged me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) broke into sobs, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). It would almost
have won round any man but Angel Clare. Within the remote depths of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) constitution, so gentle and affectionate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was in general,
there lay hidden a hard logical deposit, like a vein of metal in a
soft loam, which turned the edge of everything that attempted to
traverse it. It had blocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) acceptance of the Church; it blocked
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) acceptance of Tess. Moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) affection itself was less fire
than radiance, and, with regard to the other sex, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ceased
to believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ceased to follow: contrasting in this with many
impressionable natures, who remain sensuously infatuated with what
they intellectually despise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) waited till her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sobbing ceased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish half the women in England were as respectable as you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
said, in an ebullition of bitterness against womankind in general.
<div class="bookquote">``It isn't a question of respectability, but one of principle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) spoke such things as these and more of a kindred sort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),
being still swayed by the antipathetic wave which warps direct souls
with such persistence when once their vision finds itself mocked by
appearances. There was, it is true, underneath, a back current of
sympathy through which a woman of the world might have conquered him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).
But Tess did not think of this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) took everything as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) deserts,
and hardly opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth. The firmness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) devotion to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was
indeed almost pitiful; quick-tempered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) naturally was, nothing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could say made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) unseemly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sought not her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own; was not
provoked; thought no evil of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might just
now have been Apostolic Charity herself returned to a self-seeking
modern world.

<p/>This evening, night, and morning were passed precisely as the
preceding ones had been passed. On one, and only one, occasion did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--the formerly free and independent Tess--venture to make any
advances. It was on the third occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) starting after a meal
to go out to the flour-mill. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was leaving the table he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said
<div class="bookquote">``Goodbye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) replied in the same words, at the same time
inclining her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not avail himself of
the invitation, saying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) turned hastily aside--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be home punctually.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess shrank into herself as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been struck. Often enough had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) tried to reach those lips against her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) consent--often had he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said
gaily that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth and breath tasted of the butter and eggs and
milk and honey on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mainly lived, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) drew sustenance
from them, and other follies of that sort. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not care for
them now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sudden shrinking, and said gently--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, I have to think of a course. It was imperative that we
should stay together a little while, to avoid the scandal to you that
would have resulted from our immediate parting. But you must see it
is only for form's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess absently.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went out, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) way to the mill stood still, and wished for a
moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had responded yet more kindly, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) once at
least.

<p/>Thus they lived through this despairing day or two; in the same
house, truly; but more widely apart than before they were lovers. It
was evident to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had said, living with paralyzed
activities in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) endeavour to think of a plan of procedure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
was awe-stricken to discover such determination under such apparent
flexibility. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) consistency was, indeed, too cruel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) no longer
expected forgiveness now. More than once she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought of going away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) absence at the mill; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feared that this,
instead of benefiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), might be the means of hampering and
humiliating him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) yet more if it should become known.

<p/>Meanwhile Clare was meditating, verily. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thought had been
unsuspended; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was becoming ill with thinking; eaten out with
thinking, withered by thinking; scourged out of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) former
pulsating, flexuous domesticity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) walked about saying to himself,
<div class="bookquote">``What's to be done--what's to be done?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and by chance she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) overheard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). It caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to break the reserve about their future which had
hitherto prevailed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose--you are not going to live with me--long, are you, Angel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked, the sunk corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mouth betraying how purely
mechanical were the means by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) retained that expression of
chastened calm upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, ``without despising myself, and what is worse,
perhaps, despising you. I mean, of course, cannot live with you
in the ordinary sense. At present, whatever I feel, I do not
despise you. And, let me speak plainly, or you may not see all my
difficulties. How can we live together while that man lives?--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
being your husband in nature, and not I. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were dead it might
be different... Besides, that's not all the difficulty; it lies in
another consideration--one bearing upon the future of other people
than ourselves. Think of years to come, and children being born to
us, and this past matter getting known--for it must get known. There
is not an uttermost part of the earth but somebody comes from it or
goes to it from elsewhere. Well, think of wretches of our flesh and
blood growing up under a taunt which they will gradually get to feel
the full force of with their expanding years. What an awakening
for them! What a prospect! Can you honestly say <div class="bookquote">``Remain' after
contemplating this contingency? Don't you think we had better
endure the ills we have than fly to others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyelids, weighted with trouble, continued drooping as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say `Remain,'''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot; I had not thought
so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's feminine hope--shall we confess it?--had been so obstinately
recuperative as to revive in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) surreptitious visions of a
domiciliary intimacy continued long enough to break down his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) coldness
even against his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) judgement. Though unsophisticated in the usual
sense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was not incomplete; and it would have denoted deficiency
of womanhood if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not instinctively known what an argument lies
in propinquity. Nothing else would serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew, if this
failed. It was wrong to hope in what was of the nature of strategy,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said to herself: yet that sort of hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not extinguish.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) last representation had now been made, and it was, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said,
a new view. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had truly never thought so far as that, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
lucid picture of possible offspring who would scorn her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was one that
brought deadly convictions to an honest heart which was humanitarian
to its centre. Sheer experience had already taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that in some
circumstances there was one thing better than to lead a good life,
and that was to be saved from leading any life whatever. Like all
who have been previsioned by suffering, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could, in the words of
M. Sully-Prudhomme, hear a penal sentence in the fiat, <div class="bookquote">``You shall be
born,''  (<font color='red'><b>M.</b></font>)</div>particularly if addressed to potential issue of hers.

<p/>Yet such is the vulpine slyness of Dame Nature, that, till now, Tess
had been hoodwinked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) love for Clare into forgetting it might
result in vitalizations that would inflict upon others what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
bewailed as misfortune to herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) therefore could not withstand his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) argument. But with the
self-combating proclivity of the supersensitive, an answer thereto
arose in Clare's own mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) almost feared it. It was based
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) exceptional physical nature; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might have used it
promisingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might have added besides: <div class="bookquote">``On an Australian upland
or Texan plain, who is to know or care about my misfortunes, or to
reproach me or you?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Yet, like the majority of women, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) accepted
the momentary presentment as if it were the inevitable. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
may have been right. The intuitive heart of woman knoweth not only
its own bitterness, but its husband's, and even if these assumed
reproaches were not likely to be addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) or to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by
strangers, they might have reached his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ears from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own fastidious
brain.

<p/>It was the third day of the estrangement. Some might risk the odd
paradox that with more animalism he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have been the nobler man.
We do not say it. Yet Clare's love was doubtless ethereal to a
fault, imaginative to impracticability. With these natures, corporal
presence is something less appealing than corporal absence; the
latter creating an ideal presence that conveniently drops the defects
of the real. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) found that her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) personality did not plead her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) cause
so forcibly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had anticipated. The figurative phrase was true:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was another woman than the one who had excited his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) desire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought over what you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) remarked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
forefinger over the tablecloth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) other hand, which bore the ring
that mocked them both, supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``It is quite true,
all of it; it must be. You must go away from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what can you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare had not thought of that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite sure. We ought to part, and we may as well get it past and
done. You once said that I was apt to win men against their better
judgement; and if I am constantly before your eyes I may cause you
to change your plans in opposition to your reason and wish; and
afterwards your repentance and my sorrow will be terrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would like to go home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to leave you, and go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it shall be so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not look up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) started. There was a
difference between the proposition and the covenant, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had
felt only too quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feared it would come to this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) murmured, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) countenance
meekly fixed. <div class="bookquote">``I don't complain, Angel, I--I think it best. What
you said has quite convinced me. Yes, though nobody else should
reproach me if we should stay together, yet somewhen, years hence,
you might get angry with me for any ordinary matter, and knowing what
you do of my bygones, you yourself might be tempted to say words, and
they might be overheard, perhaps by my own children. O, what only
hurts me now would torture and kill me then! I will go--to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shall not stay here. Though I didn't like to initiate it, I
have seen that it was advisable we should part--at least for a while,
till I can better see the shape that things have taken, and can write
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess stole a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was pale, even tremulous;
but, as before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was appalled by the determination revealed in the
depths of this gentle being she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had married--the will to subdue the
grosser to the subtler emotion, the substance to the conception, the
flesh to the spirit. Propensities, tendencies, habits, were as dead
leaves upon the tyrannous wind of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) imaginative ascendency.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) look, for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) explained--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think of people more kindly when I am away from them'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; adding
cynically, <div class="bookquote">``God knows; perhaps we will shake down together some day,
for weariness; thousands have done it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That day he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) began to pack up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went upstairs and began to pack
also. Both knew that it was in their two minds that they might part
the next morning for ever, despite the gloss of assuaging conjectures
thrown over their proceeding because they were of the sort to whom
any parting which has an air of finality is a torture. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew, that, though the fascination which each had exercised
over the other--on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) part independently of accomplishments--would
probably in the first days of their separation be even more potent
than ever, time must attenuate that effect; the practical arguments
against accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as a housemate might pronounce themselves more
strongly in the boreal light of a remoter view. Moreover, when two
people are once parted--have abandoned a common domicile and a common
environment--new growths insensibly bud upward to fill each vacated
place; unforeseen accidents hinder intentions, and old plans are
forgotten.



<p/>XXXVII


<p/>Midnight came and passed silently, for there was nothing to announce
it in the Valley of the Froom.

<p/>Not long after one o'clock there was a slight creak in the darkened
farmhouse once the mansion of the d``Urbervilles. Tess, who used the
upper chamber, heard it and awoke. It had come from the corner step
of the staircase, which, as usual, was loosely nailed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw the
door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bedroom open, and the figure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband crossed the
stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
shirt and trousers only, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) first flush of joy died when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
perceived that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reached the middle of the room he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stood still and murmured in
tones of indescribable sadness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead! dead! dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Under the influence of any strongly-disturbing force, Clare would
occasionally walk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sleep, and even perform strange feats, such
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had done on the night of their return from market just before
their marriage, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) re-enacted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) bedroom his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) combat with the
man who had insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). Tess saw that continued mental distress
had wrought him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) into that somnambulistic state now.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) loyal confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lay so deep down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart, that,
awake or asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with no sort of personal fear. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had entered with a pistol in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would scarcely have
disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) protectiveness.

<p/>Clare came close, and bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Dead, dead, dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>After fixedly regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) for some moments with the same gaze of
unmeasurable woe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) bent lower, enclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arms, and rolled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in the sheet as in a shroud. Then lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from the bed with
as much respect as one would show to a dead body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
across the room, murmuring--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor, poor Tess--my dearest, darling Tess! So sweet, so good, so
true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The words of endearment, withheld so severely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) waking hours,
were inexpressibly sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) forlorn and hungry heart. If it had
been to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) weary life she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would not, by moving or struggling,
have put an end to the position she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found herself in. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lay
in absolute stillness, scarcely venturing to breathe, and, wondering
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was going to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), suffered herself to be borne out
upon the landing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife--dead, dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) labours for a moment to lean with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) against the
banister. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) going to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) down? Self-solicitude was near
extinction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and in the knowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had planned to depart
on the morrow, possibly for always, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arms in this
precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror. If
they could only fall together, and both be dashed to pieces, how fit,
how desirable.

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fall, but took advantage of the support
of the handrail to imprint a kiss upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips--lips in the day-time
scorned. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with a renewed firmness of hold, and
descended the staircase. The creak of the loose stair did not awaken
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and they reached the ground-floor safely. Freeing one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
hands from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) grasp of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) slid back the door-bar
and passed out, slightly striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) stockinged toe against the edge
of the door. But this he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) seemed not to mind, and, having room for
extension in the open air, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) against his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) shoulder, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with ease, the absence of clothes taking much
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) burden. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) off the premises in the direction
of the river a few yards distant.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ultimate intention, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had any, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not yet divined; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found herself conjecturing on the matter as a third person might
have done. So easefully had she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) whole being up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
that it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) absolute
possession, to dispose of as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) should choose. It was consoling,
under the hovering terror of to-morrow's separation, to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
really recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) now as his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife Tess, and did not cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) off,
even if in that recognition he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went so far as to arrogate to himself
the right of harming her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>Ah! now she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was dreaming of--that Sunday morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
had borne her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) along through the water with the other dairymaids, who
had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) nearly as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), if that were possible, which
Tess could hardly admit. Clare did not cross the bridge with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),
but proceeding several paces on the same side towards the adjoining
mill, at length stood still on the brink of the river.

<p/>Its waters, in creeping down these miles of meadowland, frequently
divided, serpentining in purposeless curves, looping themselves
around little islands that had no name, returning and re-embodying
themselves as a broad main stream further on. Opposite the spot to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was such a general confluence, and the river
was proportionately voluminous and deep. Across it was a narrow
foot-bridge; but now the autumn flood had washed the handrail away,
leaving the bare plank only, which, lying a few inches above the
speeding current, formed a giddy pathway for even steady heads; and
Tess had noticed from the window of the house in the day-time young
men walking across upon it as a feat in balancing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband had
possibly observed the same performance; anyhow, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now mounted the
plank, and, sliding one foot forward, advanced along it.

<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) going to drown her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)? Probably he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was. The spot was lonely,
the river deep and wide enough to make such a purpose easy of
accomplishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might drown her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would; it would be better
than parting to-morrow to lead severed lives.

<p/>The swift stream raced and gyrated under them, tossing, distorting,
and splitting the moon's reflected face. Spots of froth travelled
past, and intercepted weeds waved behind the piles. If they could
both fall together into the current now, their arms would be so
tightly clasped together that they could not be saved; they would
go out of the world almost painlessly, and there would be no more
reproach to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), or to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last half-hour with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have been a loving one, while if they lived till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) awoke,
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) day-time aversion would return, and this hour would remain to be
contemplated only as a transient dream.

<p/>The impulse stirred in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dared not indulge it, to make a
movement that would have precipitated them both into the gulf. How
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) valued her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own life had been proved; but his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had no right to
tamper with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reached the other side with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in safety.

<p/>Here they were within a plantation which formed the Abbey grounds,
and taking a new hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went onward a few steps till they
reached the ruined choir of the Abbey-church. Against the north wall
was the empty stone coffin of an abbot, in which every tourist with
a turn for grim humour was accustomed to stretch himself. In this
Clare carefully laid Tess. Having kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips a second time he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
breathed deeply, as if a greatly desired end were attained. Clare
then lay down on the ground alongside, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) immediately fell into
the deep dead slumber of exhaustion, and remained motionless as a
log. The spurt of mental excitement which had produced the effort
was now over.

<p/>Tess sat up in the coffin. The night, though dry and mild for the
season, was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
to remain here long, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) half-clothed state. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) were left to
himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would in all probability stay there till the morning, and
be chilled to certain death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had heard of such deaths after
sleep-walking. But how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dare to awaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had been doing, when it would mortify him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to discover
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) folly in respect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)? Tess, however, stepping out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
stone confine, shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) slightly, but was unable to arouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
without being violent. It was indispensable to do something, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
was beginning to shiver, the sheet being but a poor protection. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
excitement had in a measure kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) warm during the few minutes'
adventure; but that beatific interval was over.

<p/>It suddenly occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to try persuasion; and accordingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ear, with as much firmness and decision as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
summon--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us walk on, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>at the same time taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) suggestively
by the arm. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) relief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) unresistingly acquiesced; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) words
had apparently thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) dream, which thenceforward
seemed to enter on a new phase, wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had risen as a
spirit, and was leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to Heaven. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) by the
arm to the stone bridge in front of their residence, crossing which
they stood at the manor-house door. Tess's feet were quite bare, and
the stones hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and chilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to the bone; but Clare was in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) woollen stockings, and appeared to feel no discomfort.

<p/>There was no further difficulty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to lie down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
own sofa bed, and covered him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) up warmly, lighting a temporary fire of
wood, to dry any dampness out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). The noise of these attentions
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought might awaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and secretly wished that they might.
But the exhaustion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mind and body was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) remained
undisturbed.

<p/>As soon as they met the next morning Tess divined that Angel knew
little or nothing of how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been concerned in the night's
excursion, though, as regarded himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) may have been aware that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had not lain still. In truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had awakened that morning from
a sleep deep as annihilation; and during those first few moments
in which the brain, like a Samson shaking himself, is trying its
strength, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) had some dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding.
But the realities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) situation soon displaced conjecture on the
other subject.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) waited in expectancy to discern some mental pointing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) knew that
if any intention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>), concluded over-night, did not vanish in the
light of morning, it stood on a basis approximating to one of pure
reason, even if initiated by impulse of feeling; that it was so
far, therefore, to be trusted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) thus beheld in the pale morning
light the resolve to separate from her (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>); not as a hot and indignant
instinct, but denuded of the passionateness which had made it scorch
and burn; standing in its bones; nothing but a skeleton, but none the
less there. Clare no longer hesitated.

<p/>At breakfast, and while they were packing the few remaining articles,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) weariness from the night's effort so unmistakeably that
Tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened; but the
reflection that it would anger him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), grieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), stultify him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), to know
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had instinctively manifested a fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
common-sense did not approve, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) inclination had compromised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) dignity when reason slept, again deterred her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). It was too much
like laughing at a man when sober for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) erratic deeds during
intoxication.

<p/>It just crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mind, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have a faint
recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tender vagary, and was disinclined to allude to
it from a conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would take amatory advantage of the
opportunity it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) of appealing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anew not to go.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and
soon after breakfast it arrived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw in it the beginning of
the end--the temporary end, at least, for the revelation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
tenderness by the incident of the night raised dreams of a possible
future with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The luggage was put on the top, and the man drove
them off, the miller and the old waiting-woman expressing some
surprise at their precipitate departure, which Clare attributed to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) discovery that the mill-work was not of the modern kind which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
wished to investigate, a statement that was true so far as it went.
Beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to
suggest a fiasco, or that they were not going together to visit
friends.

<p/>Their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such
solemn joy in each other a few days back, and as Clare wished to wind
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) business with Mr Crick, Tess could hardly avoid paying Mrs
Crick a call at the same time, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) would excite suspicion of
their unhappy state.

<p/>To make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage
by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy-house, and
descended the track on foot, side by side. The withy-bed had been
cut, and they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife; to the left the
enclosure in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) had been fascinated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) harp; and far away
behind the cow-stalls the mead which had been the scene of their
first embrace. The gold of the summer picture was now gray, the
colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold.

<p/>Over the barton-gate the dairyman saw them, and came forward,
throwing into his (<font color='blue'><b>dairyman</b></font>) face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate
in Talbothays and its vicinity on the re-appearance of the
newly-married. Then Mrs Crick emerged from the house, and several
others of their old acquaintance, though Marian and Retty did not
seem to be there.

<p/>Tess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours, which
affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) far otherwise than they supposed. In the tacit
agreement of husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret
they behaved as would have been ordinary. And then, although she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
would rather there had been no word spoken on the subject, Tess had
to hear in detail the story of Marian and Retty. The later had gone
home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) father's, and Marian had left to look for employment
elsewhere. They feared she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) would come to no good.

<p/>To dissipate the sadness of this recital Tess went and bade all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
favourite cows goodbye, touching each of them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand, and as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) and Clare stood side by side at leaving, as if united body and
soul, there would have been something peculiarly sorry in their
aspect to one who should have seen it truly; two limbs of one life,
as they outwardly were, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm touching hers, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) skirts touching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), facing one way, as against all the dairy facing the other,
speaking in their adieux as <div class="bookquote">``we'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>, and yet sundered like the poles.
Perhaps something unusually stiff and embarrassed in their attitude,
some awkwardness in acting up to their profession of unity, different
from the natural shyness of young couples, may have been apparent,
for when they were gone Mrs Crick said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) husband--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How onnatural the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes did seem, and how they
stood like waxen images and talked as if they were in a dream!
Didn't it strike `ee that 'twas so? Tess had always sommat strange
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)'s not now quite like the proud young bride of a
well-be-doing man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>They re-entered the vehicle, and were driven along the roads towards
Weatherbury and Stagfoot Lane, till they reached the Lane inn, where
Clare dismissed the fly and man. They rested here a while, and
entering the Vale were next driven onward towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Crick</b></font>) home by a
stranger who did not know their relations. At a midway point, when
Nuttlebury had been passed, and where there were cross-roads, Clare
stopped the conveyance and said to Tess that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) meant to return
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's house it was here that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). As they
could not talk with freedom in the driver's presence he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to
accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) for a few steps on foot along one of the branch roads;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) assented, and directing the man to wait a few minutes they
strolled away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, let us understand each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said gently. <div class="bookquote">``There is no
anger between us, though there is that which I cannot endure at
present. I will try to bring myself to endure it. I will let you
know where I go to as soon as I know myself. And if I can bring
myself to bear it--if it is desirable, possible--I will come to you.
But until I come to you it will be better that you should not try to
come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The severity of the decree seemed deadly to Tess; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) view of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) clearly enough; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in no other light than that
of one who had practised gross deceit upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Yet could a woman
who had done even what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had done deserve all this? But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could
contest the point with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no further. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) simply repeated after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Until you come to me I must not try to come to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I write to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes--if you are ill, or want anything at all. I hope that will
not be the case; so that it may happen that I write first to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I agree to the conditions, Angel; because you know best what my
punishment ought to be; only--only--don't make it more than I can
bear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>That was all she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said on the matter. If Tess had been artful, had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) made a scene, fainted, wept hysterically, in that lonely lane,
notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
possessed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would probably not have withstood her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mood
of long-suffering made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) herself was
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best advocate. Pride, too, entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) submission--which
perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too
apparent in the whole d``Urberville family--and the many effective
chords which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could have stirred by an appeal were left untouched.

<p/>The remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
now handed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a packet containing a fairly good sum of money, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had obtained from his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) bankers for the purpose. The brilliants,
the interest in which seemed to be Tess's for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life only -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
understood the wording of the will-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) send
to a bank for safety; and to this she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) readily agreed.

<p/>These things arranged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) walked with Tess back to the carriage,
and handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in. The coachman was paid and told where to drive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Taking next his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) own bag and umbrella--the sole articles he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had
brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) hitherwards--he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) goodbye; and they parted
there and then.

<p/>The fly moved creepingly up a hill, and Clare watched it go with an
unpremeditated hope that Tess would look out of the window for one
moment. But that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) never thought of doing, would not have ventured
to do, lying in a half-dead faint inside. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) recede,
and in the anguish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) heart quoted a line from a poet, with
peculiar emendations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own--


<p/>God's NOT in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) heaven:
All's WRONG with the world!


<p/>When Tess had passed over the crest of the hill he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) turned to go his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
own way, and hardly knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) still.



<p/>XXXVIII


<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) drove on through Blackmoor Vale, and the landscape of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
youth began to open around her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), Tess aroused herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stupor.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) first thought was how would she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) be able to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reached a turnpike-gate which stood upon the highway to the
village. It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who
had kept it for many years, and to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been known; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
probably left on New Year's Day, the date when such changes were
made. Having received no intelligence lately from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
asked the turnpike-keeper for news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--nothing, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Marlott is Marlott still. Folks
have died and that. John Durbeyfield, too, hev had a daughter
married this week to a gentleman-farmer; not from John's own house,
you know; they was married elsewhere; the gentleman being of that
high standing that John's own folk was not considered well-be-doing
enough to have any part in it, the bridegroom seeming not to know
how't have been discovered that John is a old and ancient nobleman
himself by blood, with family skillentons in their own vaults to
this day, but done out of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) property in the time o' the Romans.
However, Sir John, as we call 'n now, kept up the wedding-day as well
as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could, and stood treat to everybody in the parish; and John's
wife sung songs at The Pure Drop till past eleven o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Hearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not decide
to go home publicly in the fly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) luggage and belongings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
asked the turnpike-keeper if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might deposit her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) things at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
house for a while, and, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offering no objection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dismissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) carriage, and went on to the village alone by a back lane.

<p/>At sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's chimney she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked herself how she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
possibly enter the house? Inside that cottage her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) relations were
calmly supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) far away on a wedding-tour with a comparatively
rich man, who was to conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to bouncing prosperity; while here
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, friendless, creeping up to the old door quite by herself,
with no better place to go to in the world.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not reach the house unobserved. Just by the garden-hedge she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
was met by a girl who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--one of the two or three with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had been intimate at school. After making a few inquiries as to how
Tess came there, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) friend, unheeding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tragic look, interrupted
with--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But where's thy gentleman, Tess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess hastily explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been called away on business, and,
leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) interlocutor, clambered over the garden-hedge, and thus
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) way to the house.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went up the garden-path she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother singing by the
back door, coming in sight of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) perceived Mrs Durbeyfield on
the doorstep in the act of wringing a sheet. Having performed this
without observing Tess, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went indoors, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) daughter followed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>The washing-tub stood in the same old place on the same old
quarter-hogshead, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother, having thrown the sheet aside, was
about to plunge her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arms in anew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--Tess!--my chil'--I thought you was married!--married really and
truly this time--we sent the cider--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother; so I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Tuesday, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What's the meaning o' that? <div class="bookquote">``Nation seize such husbands as you seem
to get, say I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Tess went across to Joan Durbeyfield, laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face upon
the matron's bosom, and burst into sobs. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how to tell
`ee, mother! You said to me, and wrote to me, that I was not to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). But I did tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--I couldn't help it--and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O you little fool--you little fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>burst out Mrs Durbeyfield,
splashing Tess and herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) agitation. <div class="bookquote">``My good God! that ever
I should ha' lived to say it, but I say it again, you little fool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess was convulsed with weeping, the tension of so many days having
relaxed at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it--I know--I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gasped through her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sobs. <div class="bookquote">``But,
O my mother, I could not help it! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was so good--and I felt
the wickedness of trying to blind him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as to what had happened!
If--if--it were to be done again--I should do the same. I could
not--I dared not--so sin--against him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you sinned enough to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) first!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; that's where my misery do lie! But I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could get

you knew--if you could only half know how I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--how anxious I
was to have him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--and how wrung I was between caring so much for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
and my wish to be fair to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess was so shaken that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could get no further, and sank, a
helpless thing, into a chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well; what's done can't be undone! I'm sure I don't know why
children o' my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than
other people's--not to know better than to blab such a thing as
that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) couldn't ha' found it out till too late!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Here Mrs
Durbeyfield began shedding tears on her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) own account as a mother to
be pitied. <div class="bookquote">``What your father will say I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continued;
<div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s been talking about the wedding up at Rolliver's and The
Pure Drop every day since, and about his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) family getting back to their
rightful position through you--poor silly man!--and now you've made
this mess of it! The Lord-a-Lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As if to bring matters to a focus, Tess's father was heard
approaching at that moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not, however, enter immediately,
and Mrs Durbeyfield said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) would break the bad news to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
herself, Tess keeping out of sight for the present. After her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) first
burst of disappointment Joan began to take the mishap as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) had
taken Tess's original trouble, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have taken a wet holiday
or failure in the potato-crop; as a thing which had come upon them
irrespective of desert or folly; a chance external impingement to be
borne with; not a lesson.

<p/>Tess retreated upstairs and beheld casually that the beds had been
shifted, and new arrangements made. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) old bed had been adapted for
two younger children. There was no place here for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) now.

<p/>The room below being unceiled she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could hear most of what went on
there. Presently her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father entered, apparently carrying in a live
hen. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a foot-haggler now, having been obliged to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
second horse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) travelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) basket on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm. The hen
had been carried about this morning as it was often carried, to show
people that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) work, though it had lain, with its legs
tied, under the table at Rolliver's for more than an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've just had up a story about--''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Durbeyfield began, and thereupon
related in detail to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife a discussion which had arisen at the
inn about the clergy, originated by the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter having
married into a clerical family. <div class="bookquote">``They was formerly styled `sir',
like my own ancestry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``though nowadays their true style,
strictly speaking, is `clerk' only.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As Tess had wished that no
great publicity should be given to the event, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had mentioned no
particulars. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would remove that prohibition soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
proposed that the couple should take Tess's own name, d``Urberville,
as uncorrupted. It was better than her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) husbands's. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked if any
letter had come from her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) that day.

<p/>Then Mrs Durbeyfield informed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that no letter had come, but Tess
unfortunately had come herself.

<p/>When at length the collapse was explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), a sullen
mortification, not usual with Durbeyfield, overpowered the influence
of the cheering glass. Yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the
minds of others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think, now, that this was to be the end o`t!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/St John</b></font>)</div>said Sir John.
``And I with a family vault under that there church of Kingsbere as
big as Squire Jollard's ale-cellar, and my folk lying there in sixes
and sevens, as genuine county bones and marrow as any recorded in
history. And now to be sure what they fellers at Rolliver's and The
Pure Drop will say to me! How they'll squint and glane, and say,
``This is yer mighty match is it; this is yer getting back to the true
level of yer forefathers in King Norman's time!<div class="bookquote">'' I feel this is too
much, Joan; I shall put an end to myself, title and all--I can bear
it no longer! ... But she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) can make him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s married
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>King Norman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rolliver</b></font>) won't think o' doing that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``D'ye think he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) really have married her (<font color='blue'><b>Rolliver</b></font>)?--or is it like the first--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Poor Tess</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Tess, who had heard as far as this, could not bear to hear more.
The perception that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) word could be doubted even here, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own
parental house, set her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mind against the spot as nothing else could
have done. How unexpected were the attacks of destiny! And if her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
father doubted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) a little, would not neighbours and acquaintance
doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) much? O, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not live long at home!

<p/>A few days, accordingly, were all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) allowed herself here, at
the end of which time she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) received a short note from Clare, informing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had gone to the North of England to look at a farm. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) craving for the lustre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) true position as his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife, and to
hide from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents the vast extent of the division between them,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) made use of this letter as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reason for again departing,
leaving them under the impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was setting out to join
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). Still further to screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband from any imputation of
unkindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) took twenty-five of the fifty pounds Clare
had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and handed the sum over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother, as if the wife
of a man like Angel Clare could well afford it, saying that it was a
slight return for the trouble and humiliation she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had brought upon
them in years past. With this assertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dignity she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bade them
farewell; and after that there were lively doings in the Durbeyfield
household for some time on the strength of Tess's bounty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother
saying, and, indeed, believing, that the rupture which had arisen
between the young husband and wife had adjusted itself under their
strong feeling that they could not live apart from each other.



<p/>XXXIX


<p/>It was three weeks after the marriage that Clare found himself
descending the hill which led to the well-known parsonage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
father. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) downward course the tower of the church rose into
the evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had come; and no
living person in the twilighted town seemed to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), still less
to expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was arriving like a ghost, and the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
own footsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of.

<p/>The picture of life had changed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). Before this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had
known it but speculatively; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knew it as a practical
man; though perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not, even yet. Nevertheless humanity
stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) no longer in the pensive sweetness of Italian art,
but in the staring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum, and with
the leer of a study by Van Beers.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Beers</b></font>) conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond
description. After mechanically attempting to pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Beers</b></font>)
agricultural plans as though nothing unusual had happened, in
the manner recommended by the great and wise men of all ages, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beers</b></font>)
concluded that very few of those great and wise men had ever gone so
far outside themselves as to test the feasibility of their counsel.
<div class="bookquote">``This is the chief thing: be not perturbed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pagan</b></font>)</div>said the Pagan moralist.
That was just Clare's own opinion. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was perturbed. <div class="bookquote">``Let not
your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said the Nazarene.
Clare chimed in cordially; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) heart was troubled all the same.
How he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would have liked to confront those two great thinkers, and
earnestly appeal to them as fellow-man to fellow-men, and ask them
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) their method!

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was looking on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own existence with the passive
interest of an outsider.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been
brought about by the accident of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) being a d``Urberville. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>)
found that Tess came of that exhausted ancient line, and was not of
the new tribes from below, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) had fondly dreamed, why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) not
stoically abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in fidelity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) principles? This was what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) had got by apostasy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) punishment was deserved.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) became weary and anxious, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) anxiety increased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>)
wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) unfairly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) ate without knowing that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) ate, and drank without tasting. As the hours dropped past, as the
motive of each act in the long series of bygone days presented itself
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) perceived how intimately the notion of having Tess as
a dear possession was mixed up with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) schemes and words and
ways.

<p/>In going hither and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) observed in the outskirts of a small
town a red-and-blue placard setting forth the great advantages of
the Empire of Brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist.
Land was offered there on exceptionally advantageous terms. Brazil
somewhat attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) as a new idea. Tess could eventually join him (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>)
there, and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions
and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seem impracticable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) here. In brief he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) was strongly
inclined to try Brazil, especially as the season for going thither
was just at hand.

<p/>With this view he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) was returning to Emminster to disclose his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) plan
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) parents, and to make the best explanation he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) could make of
arriving without Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated
them. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) reached the door the new moon shone upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) face, just
as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>)
had carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) wife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) arms across the river to the graveyard
of the monks; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) face was thinner now.

<p/>Clare had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) parents no warning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) visit, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arrival
stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher
stirs a quiet pool. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father and mother were both in the
drawing-room, but neither of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) brothers was now at home. Angel
entered, and closed the door quietly behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But--where's your wife, dear Angel?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``How you
surprise us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother's--temporarily. I have come home rather in a
hurry because I've decided to go to Brazil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brazil! Why they are all Roman Catholics there surely!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they? I hadn't thought of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr interest</b></font>)</div><p/>But even the novelty and painfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) going to a Papistical
land could not displace for long Mr and Mrs Clare's natural interest
in their son's marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had your brief note three weeks ago announcing that it had taken
place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clare/Mrs Angel Clare</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Clare, <div class="bookquote">``and your father sent your godmother's gift
to her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>), as you know. Of course it was best that none of us should be
present, especially as you preferred to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) from the dairy, and
not at her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) home, wherever that may be. It would have embarrassed
you, and given us no pleasure. Your bothers felt that very strongly.
Now it is done we do not complain, particularly if she (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) suits you for
the business you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the
Gospel. ... Yet I wish I could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) first, Angel, or have
known a little more about her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>). We sent her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) no present of our own,
not knowing what would best give her (<font color='blue'><b>godmother</b></font>) pleasure, but you must suppose
it only delayed. Angel, there is no irritation in my mind or your
father's against you for this marriage; but we have thought it much
better to reserve our liking for your wife till we could see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
And now you have not brought her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). It seems strange. What has
happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clare/Mrs Angel Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) replied that it had been thought best by them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) should to
go her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) parents' home for the present, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) came there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind telling you, dear mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that I always
meant to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) away from this house till I should feel she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could
come with credit to you. But this idea of Brazil is quite a recent
one. If I do go it will be unadvisable for me to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on this my
first journey. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will remain at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's till I come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shall not see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before you start?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was afraid they would not. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) original plan had been, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had
said, to refrain from bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) there for some little while--not
to wound their prejudices--feelings--in any way; and for other
reasons he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had adhered to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have to visit home in the
course of a year, if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went out at once; and it would be possible
for them to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) started a second time--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>A hastily prepared supper was brought in, and Clare made further
exposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) plans. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother's disappointment at not seeing
the bride still remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>). Clare's late enthusiasm for Tess
had infected her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) maternal sympathies, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had almost
fancied that a good thing could come out of Nazareth--a charming
woman out of Talbothays Dairy. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cannot you describe her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is very pretty, Angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of that there can be no question!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, with a zest which
covered its bitterness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is pure and virtuous goes without question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pure and virtuous, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) quite distinctly. You said the other day that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
fine in figure; roundly built; had deep red lips like Cupid's bow;
dark eyelashes and brows, an immense rope of hair like a ship's
cable; and large eyes violety-bluey-blackish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). And living in such seclusion she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) naturally had
scarce ever seen any young man from the world without till she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scarcely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are worse wives than these simple, rosy-mouthed, robust girls
of the farm. Certainly I could have wished--well, since my son is to
be an agriculturist, it is perhaps but proper that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife should
have been accustomed to an outdoor life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father was less inquisitive; but when the time came for the
chapter from the Bible which was always read before evening prayers,
the Vicar observed to Mrs Clare--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, since Angel has come, that it will be more appropriate to
read the thirty-first of Proverbs than the chapter which we should
have had in the usual course of our reading?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clare/Mrs Angel Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clare/Mrs Angel Clare</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Clare. <div class="bookquote">``The words of King Lemuel''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)

your father has decided to read us the chapter in Proverbs in praise
of a virtuous wife. We shall not need to be reminded to apply the
words to the absent one. May Heaven shield her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ways!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>A lump rose in Clare's throat. The portable lectern was taken out
from the corner and set in the middle of the fireplace, the two old
servants came in, and Angel's father began to read at the tenth verse
of the aforesaid chapter--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can find a virtuous woman? for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) price is far
above rubies. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) riseth while it is yet night, and
giveth meat to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) household. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) girdeth her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loins
with strength and strengtheneth her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
perceiveth that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) merchandise is good; her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) candle
goeth not out by night. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looketh well to the ways
of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) children arise up and call her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) blessed; her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband
also, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) praiseth her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Many daughters have done
virtuously, but thou excellest them all.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Angel father</b></font>)</div><p/>When prayers were over, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother said--

<p/>``I could not help thinking how very aptly that chapter your dear
father read applied, in some of its particulars, to the woman you
have chosen. The perfect woman, you see, was a working woman; not an
idler; not a fine lady; but one who used her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart for the good of others. ``Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children arise up and call
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blessed; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband also, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) praiseth her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Many daughters
have done virtuously, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) excelleth them all.<div class="bookquote">'' Well, I wish I
could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Angel. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is pure and chaste, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would
have been refined enough for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare could bear this no longer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes were full of tears, which
seemed like drops of molten lead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) bade a quick good night to
these sincere and simple souls whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) loved so well; who knew
neither the world, the flesh, nor the devil in their own hearts, only
as something vague and external to themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own
chamber.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mother followed him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), and tapped at his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) door. Clare opened it to
discover her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) standing without, with anxious eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``is there something wrong that you go away so
soon? I am quite sure you are not yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not, quite, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? Now, my son, I know it is that--I know it is about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!
Have you quarrelled in these three weeks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not exactly quarrelled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But we have had a
difference--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel--is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a young woman whose history will bear investigation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a mother</b></font>)</div><p/>With a mother's instinct Mrs Clare had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) finger on the kind of
trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is spotless!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) replied; and felt that if it had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to
eternal hell there and then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have told that lie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then never mind the rest. After all, there are few purer things in
nature then an unsullied country maid. Any crudeness of manner which
may offend your more educated sense at first, will, I am sure,
disappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Such terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to Clare the
secondary perception that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had utterly wrecked his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) career by this
marriage, which had not been among his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) early thoughts after the
disclosure. True, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own account he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) cared very little about his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
career; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had wished to make it at least a respectable one on
account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) parents and brothers. And now as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) looked into the
candle its flame dumbly expressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) that it was made to shine on
sensible people, and that it abhorred lighting the face of a dupe and
a failure.

<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) agitation had cooled he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would be at moments incensed with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) poor wife for causing a situation in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was obliged to
practise deception on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) parents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) almost talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
anger, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been in the room. And then her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cooing voice,
plaintive in expostulation, disturbed the darkness, the velvet touch
of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) brow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could distinguish in the air
the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breath.

<p/>This night the woman of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) belittling deprecations was thinking how
great and good her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband was. But over them both there hung a
deeper shade than the shade which Angel Clare perceived, namely, the
shade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own limitations. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) attempted independence of
judgement this advanced and well-meaning young man, a sample product
of the last five-and-twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and
conventionality when surprised back into his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) early teachings. No
prophet had told him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was not prophet enough to tell himself,
that essentially this young wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was as deserving of the
praise of King Lemuel as any other woman endowed with the same
dislike of evil, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moral value having to be reckoned not by
achievement but by tendency. Moreover, the figure near at hand
suffers on such occasion, because it shows up its sorriness without
shade; while vague figures afar off are honoured, in that their
distance makes artistic virtues of their stains. In considering
what Tess was not, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) overlooked what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, and forgot that the
defective can be more than the entire.



<p/>XL


<p/>At breakfast Brazil was the topic, and all endeavoured to take a
hopeful view of Clare's proposed experiment with that country's soil,
notwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farm-labourers who
had emigrated thither and returned home within the twelve months.
After breakfast Clare went into the little town to wind up such
trifling matters as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was concerned with there, and to get from
the local bank all the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) possessed. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) way back he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
encountered Miss Mercy Chant by the church, from whose walls she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
seemed to be a sort of emanation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was carrying an armful of
Bibles for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) class, and such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) view of life that events which
produced heartache in others wrought beatific smiles upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)--an
enviable result, although, in the opinion of Angel, it was obtained
by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had learnt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was about to leave England, and observed what
an excellent and promising scheme it seemed to be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense, no doubt,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Mercy, it snaps the continuity of
existence. Perhaps a cloister would be preferable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A cloister! O, Angel Clare!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you wicked man, a cloister implies a monk, and a monk Roman
Catholicism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Roman Catholicism sin, and sin damnation. Thou art in a parlous
state, Angel Clare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ glory in my Protestantism!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said severely.

<p/>Then Clare, thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods
in which a man does despite to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) true principles, called her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) close
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and fiendishly whispered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ear the most heterodox ideas
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could think of. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) momentary laughter at the horror which
appeared on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fair face ceased when it merged in pain and anxiety
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) welfare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Mercy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you must forgive me. I think I am going
crazy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was; and thus the interview ended, and Clare
re-entered the Vicarage. With the local banker he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) deposited the
jewels till happier days should arise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) also paid into the bank
thirty pounds--to be sent to Tess in a few months, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might
require; and wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents' home in Blackmoor Vale to
inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had done. This amount, with the sum he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had
already placed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hands--about fifty pounds--he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hoped would be
amply sufficient for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wants just at present, particularly as in
an emergency she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been directed to apply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) deemed it best not to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) parents into communication with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
by informing them of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) address; and, being unaware of what had
really happened to estrange the two, neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
mother suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) should do so. During the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) left the
parsonage, for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had to complete he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wished to get done quickly.

<p/>As the last duty before leaving this part of England it was necessary
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to call at the Wellbridge farmhouse, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had spent
with Tess the first three days of their marriage, the trifle of rent
having to be paid, the key given up of the rooms they had occupied,
and two or three small articles fetched away that they had left
behind. It was under this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) life had stretched its gloom over him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). Yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had
unlocked the door of the sitting-room and looked into it, the memory
which returned first upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was that of their happy arrival on a
similar afternoon, the first fresh sense of sharing a habitation
conjointly, the first meal together, the chatting by the fire with
joined hands.

<p/>The farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wife were in the field at the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) visit,
and Clare was in the rooms alone for some time. Inwardly swollen
with a renewal of sentiment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had not quite reckoned with, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
went upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chamber, which had never been his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). The bed
was smooth as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had made it with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own hands on the morning of
leaving. The mistletoe hung under the tester just as he (<font color='blue'><b>tester</b></font>) had placed
it. Having been there three or four weeks it was turning colour, and
the leaves and berries were wrinkled. Angel took it down and crushed
it into the grate. Standing there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) for the first time doubted
whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) course in this conjecture had been a wise, much less
a generous, one. But had he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) not been cruelly blinded? In the
incoherent multitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) emotions he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) knelt down at the bedside
wet-eyed. <div class="bookquote">``O Tess! If you had only told me sooner, I would have
forgiven you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mourned.

<p/>Hearing a footstep below, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) rose and went to the top of the stairs.
At the bottom of the flight he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) saw a woman standing, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
turning up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face recognized the pale, dark-eyed Izz Huett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I've called to see you and Mrs Clare, and to
inquire if ye be well. I thought you might be back here again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a girl whose secret he (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) had guessed, but who had not yet
guessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>); an honest girl who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>)--one who would have made as
good, or nearly as good, a practical farmer's wife as Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am here alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``we are not living here now.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Explaining
why he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had come, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``Which way are you going home, Izz?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no home at Talbothays Dairy now, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div><p/>Izz looked down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was so dismal there that I left! I am staying out this way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pointed in a contrary direction, the direction in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) was
journeying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--are you going there now? I can take you if you
wish for a lift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) olive complexion grew richer in hue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank `ee, Mr Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) soon found the farmer, and settled the account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) rent and
the few other items which had to be considered by reason of the
sudden abandonment of the lodgings. On Clare's return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) horse
and gig, Izz jumped up beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to leave England, Izz,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) said, as they drove on.
<div class="bookquote">``Going to Brazil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do Mrs Clare like the notion of such a journey?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is not going at present--say for a year or so. I am going out
to reconnoitre--to see what life there is like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div><p/>They sped along eastward for some considerable distance, Izz making
no observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are the others?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) inquired. <div class="bookquote">``How is Retty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was in a sort of nervous state when I zid her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) last; and so thin

fall in love wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz absently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Marian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div><p/>Izz lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marian drinks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. The dairyman has got rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't drink, and I bain't in a decline. But--I am no great things

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is that? Do you remember how neatly you used to turn '' (<font color='red'><b>Cupid</b></font>)</div>'Twas
down in Cupid's Gardens' and <div class="bookquote">``The Tailor's Breeches' at morning
milking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cupid</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes! When you first came, sir, that was. Not when you had been
there a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why was that falling-off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) black eyes flashed up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) face for one moment by way of
answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Izz!--how weak of you--for such as I!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) said, and fell into
reverie. <div class="bookquote">``Then--suppose I had asked YOU to marry me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``If you had I should have said <div class="bookquote">``Yes', and you would have married a
woman who loved `ee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Down to the ground!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) whispered vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``O my God! did you
never guess it till now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>By-and-by they reached a branch road to a village.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must get down. I live out there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz abruptly, never having
spoken since her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) avowal.

<p/>Clare slowed the horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was incensed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fate, bitterly
disposed towards social ordinances; for they had cooped him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) up in a
corner, out of which there was no legitimate pathway. Why not be
revenged on society by shaping his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) future domesticities loosely,
instead of kissing the pedagogic rod of convention in this ensnaring
manner?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to Brazil alone, Izz,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have separated from
my wife for personal, not voyaging, reasons. I may never live with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again. I may not be able to love you; but--will you go with me
instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You truly wish me to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. I have been badly used enough to wish for relief. And you at
least love me disinterestedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I will go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will? You know what it means, Izz?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It means that I shall live with you for the time you are over
there--that's good enough for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember, you are not to trust me in morals now. But I ought
to remind you that it will be wrong-doing in the eyes of
civilization--Western civilization, that is to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind that; no woman do when it comes to agony-point, and
there's no other way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't get down, but sit where you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) drove past the cross-roads, one mile, two miles, without showing
any signs of affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You love me very, very much, Izz?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) suddenly asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do--I have said I do! I loved you all the time we was at the
dairy together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than Tess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``not more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because nobody could love `ee more than Tess did! ... She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would
have laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life for `ee. I could do no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the prophet</b></font>)</div><p/>Like the prophet on the top of Peor, Izz Huett would fain have spoken
perversely at such a moment, but the fascination exercised over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
rougher nature by Tess's character compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to grace.

<p/>Clare was silent; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) heart had risen at these straightforward words
from such an unexpected unimpeachable quarter. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) throat was
something as if a sob had solidified there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ears repeated, ``SHE
WOULD HAVE LAID DOWN HER LIFE FOR <div class="bookquote">``EE. I COULD DO NO MORE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forget our idle talk, Izz,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, turning the horse's head
suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I've been saying! I will now drive
you back to where your lane branches off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much for honesty towards `ee! O--how can I bear it--how can
I--how can I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div><p/>Izz Huett burst into wild tears, and beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) forehead as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you regret that poor little act of justice to an absent one?
O, Izz, don't spoil it by regret!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stilled herself by degrees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, sir. Perhaps I didn't know what I was saying, either,
wh--when I agreed to go! I wish--what cannot be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I have a loving wife already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes! You have!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They reached the corner of the lane which they had passed half an
hour earlier, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hopped down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Izz--please, please forget my momentary levity!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``It was
so ill-considered, so ill-advised!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forget it? Never, never! O, it was no levity to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) felt how richly he (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) deserved the reproach that the wounded cry
conveyed, and, in a sorrow that was inexpressible, leapt down and
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but, Izz, we'll part friends, anyhow? You don't know what
I've had to bear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was a really generous girl, and allowed no further bitterness to
mar their adieux.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgive `ee, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Izz,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) said, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) there, forcing
himself to the mentor's part he (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) was far from feeling; <div class="bookquote">``I want you to
tell Marian when you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) is to be a good woman, and not
to give way to folly. Promise that, and tell Retty that there are
more worthy men than I in the world, that for my sake she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) is to act
wisely and well--remember the words--wisely and well--for my sake.
I send this message to them as a dying man to the dying; for I shall
never see them again. And you, Izzy, you have saved me by your
honest words about my wife from an incredible impulse towards folly
and treachery. Women may be bad, but they are not so bad as men in
these things! On that one account I can never forget you. Be always
the good and sincere girl you have hitherto been; and think of me as
a worthless lover, but a faithful friend. Promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gave the promise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven bless and keep you, sir. Goodbye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) drove on; but no sooner had Izz turned into the lane, and Clare
was out of sight, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) flung herself down on the bank in a fit of
racking anguish; and it was with a strained unnatural face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's cottage late that night. Nobody ever was told
how Izz spent the dark hours that intervened between Angel Clare's
parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arrival home.

<p/>Clare, too, after bidding the girl farewell, was wrought to aching
thoughts and quivering lips. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sorrow was not for Izz. That
evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) was within a feather-weight's turn of abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) road
to the nearest station, and driving across that elevated dorsal line
of South Wessex which divided him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) Tess's home. It was
neither a contempt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) nature, nor the probable state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
heart, which deterred him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>).

<p/>No; it was a sense that, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) love, as corroborated by Izz's
admission, the facts had not changed. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) was right at first,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) was right now. And the momentum of the course on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)
had embarked tended to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) going in it, unless diverted by
a stronger, more sustained force than had played upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) this
afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) could soon come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) took the train that
night for London, and five days after shook hands in farewell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)
brothers at the port of embarkation.



<p/>XLI


<p/>From the foregoing events of the winter-time let us press on to
an October day, more than eight months subsequent to the parting
of Clare and Tess. We discover the latter in changed conditions;
instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore, we see
her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) own porterage,
as at an earlier time when she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was no bride; instead of the ample
means that were projected by her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) husband for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) comfort through
this probationary period, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) can produce only a flattened purse.

<p/>After again leaving Marlott, her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) home, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had got through the
spring and summer without any great stress upon her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) physical powers,
the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service
at dairy-work near Port-Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley,
equally remote from her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) native place and from Talbothays. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
preferred this to living on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) allowance. Mentally she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) remained in
utter stagnation, a condition which the mechanical occupation rather
fostered than checked. Her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) consciousness was at that other dairy,
at that other season, in the presence of the tender lover who had
confronted her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) there--he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) who, the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had grasped him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to keep
for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) own, had disappeared like a shape in a vision.

<p/>The dairy-work lasted only till the milk began to lessen, for she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
had not met with a second regular engagement as at Talbothays, but
had done duty as a supernumerary only. However, as harvest was now
beginning, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble
to find plenty of further occupation, and this continued till harvest
was done.

<p/>Of the five-and-twenty pounds which had remained to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) of Clare's
allowance, after deducting the other half of the fifty as a
contribution to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) parents for the trouble and expense to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had put them, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had as yet spent but little. But there now
followed an unfortunate interval of wet weather, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was
obliged to fall back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) sovereigns.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) could not bear to let them go. Angel had put them into her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hand,
had obtained them bright and new from his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) bank for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) touch had
consecrated them to souvenirs of himself--they appeared to have had
as yet no other history than such as was created by his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) own
experiences--and to disperse them was like giving away relics. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had to do it, and one by one they left her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hands.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had been compelled to send her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mother her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) address from time to
time, but she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) circumstances. When her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) money had almost
gone a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mother reached her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>). Joan stated that they
were in dreadful difficulty; the autumn rains had gone through the
thatch of the house, which required entire renewal; but this could
not be done because the previous thatching had never been paid for.
New rafters and a new ceiling upstairs also were required, which,
with the previous bill, would amount to a sum of twenty pounds. As
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this
time, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) not send them the money?

<p/>Tess had thirty pounds coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) almost immediately from Angel's
bankers, and, the case being so deplorable, as soon as the sum was
received she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sent the twenty as requested. Part of the remainder
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was obliged to expend in winter clothing, leaving only a nominal
sum for the whole inclement season at hand. When the last pound
had gone, a remark of Angel's that whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) required further
resources she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was to apply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father, remained to be considered.

<p/>But the more Tess thought of the step, the more reluctant was she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to
take it. The same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be
called, on Clare's account, which had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to hide from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own
parents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) owning to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was in want after the fair allowance he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).
They probably despised her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) already; how much more they would despise
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in the character of a mendicant! The consequence was that by no
effort could the parson's daughter-in-law bring herself to let him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
know her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) state.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) reluctance to communicate with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) husband's parents might,
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) thought, lessen with the lapse of time; but with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) own the
reverse obtained. On her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) leaving their house after the short visit
subsequent to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) marriage they were under the impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>)
was ultimately going to join her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) husband; and from that time to the
present she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) had done nothing to disturb their belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) was
awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) return in comfort, hoping against hope that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) journey
to Brazil would result in a short stay only, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would
come to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>), or that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would write for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) to join him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); in any
case that they would soon present a united front to their families
and the world. This hope she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) still fostered. To let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) parents
know that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) was a deserted wife, dependent, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) had
relieved their necessities, on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) own hands for a living, after the
_éclat_ of a marriage which was to nullify the collapse of the first
attempt, would be too much indeed.

<p/>The set of brilliants returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) mind. Where Clare had
deposited them she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) did not know, and it mattered little, if it were
true that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) could only use and not sell them. Even were they
absolutely hers it would be passing mean to enrich herself by a legal
title to them which was not essentially hers at all.

<p/>Meanwhile her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) husband's days had been by no means free from trial.
At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near
Curitiba in Brazil, having been drenched with thunder-storms and
persecuted by other hardships, in common with all the English farmers
and farm-labourers who, just at this time, were deluded into going
thither by the promises of the Brazilian Government, and by the
baseless assumption that those frames which, ploughing and sowing on
English uplands, had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they
had been born, could resist equally well all the weathers by which
they were surprised on Brazilian plains.

<p/>To return. Thus it happened that when the last of Tess's sovereigns
had been spent she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was unprovided with others to take their place,
while on account of the season she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found it increasingly difficult
to get employment. Not being aware of the rarity of intelligence,
energy, health, and willingness in any sphere of life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) refrained
from seeking an indoor occupation; fearing towns, large houses,
people of means and social sophistication, and of manners other
than rural. From that direction of gentility Black Care had come.
Society might be better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) supposed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) slight experience
of it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had no proof of this, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) instinct in the
circumstances was to avoid its purlieus.

<p/>The small dairies to the west, beyond Port-Bredy, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had served as supernumerary milkmaid during the spring and summer
required no further aid. Room would probably have been made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
at Talbothays, if only out of sheer compassion; but comfortable as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life had been there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not go back. The anti-climax
would be too intolerable; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) return might bring reproach upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) idolized husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not have borne their pity, and their
whispered remarks to one another upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) strange situation; though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would almost have faced a knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) circumstances by every
individual there, so long as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) story had remained isolated in the
mind of each. It was the interchange of ideas about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sensitiveness wince. Tess could not account for this
distinction; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) simply knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was now on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) way to an upland farm in the centre of the county,
to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been recommended by a wandering letter which had
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from Marian. Marian had somehow heard that Tess was
separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband--probably through Izz Huett--and the
good-natured and now tippling girl, deeming Tess in trouble, had
hastened to notify to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) former friend that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) herself had gone to
this upland spot after leaving the dairy, and would like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
there, where there was room for other hands, if it was really true
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) worked again as of old.

<p/>With the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband's
forgiveness began to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); and there was something of the
habitude of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rambled on--disconnecting herself by littles from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eventful
past at every step, obliterating her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) identity, giving no thought to
accidents or contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
whereabouts by others of importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own happiness, if not to
theirs.

<p/>Among the difficulties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lonely position not the least was
the attention she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) appearance, a certain bearing of
distinction, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had caught from Clare, being superadded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
natural attractiveness. Whilst the clothes lasted which had been
prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) marriage, these casual glances of interest caused
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) no inconvenience, but as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was compelled to don the
wrapper of a fieldwoman, rude words were addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) more than
once; but nothing occurred to cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bodily fear till a particular
November afternoon.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had preferred the country west of the River Brit to the upland
farm for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was now bound, because, for one thing, it was
nearer to the home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband's father; and to hover about that
region unrecognized, with the notion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might decide to call at
the Vicarage some day, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pleasure. But having once decided to
try the higher and drier levels, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pressed back eastward, marching
afoot towards the village of Chalk-Newton, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) meant to pass
the night.

<p/>The lane was long and unvaried, and, owing to the rapid shortening of
the days, dusk came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was aware. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had reached
the top of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length
in glimpses, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard footsteps behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) back, and in a few
moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was overtaken by a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped up alongside Tess and
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, my pretty maid'' (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>: to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) civilly replied.

<p/>The light still remaining in the sky lit up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face, though the
landscape was nearly dark. The man turned and stared hard at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>``Why, surely, it is the young wench who was at Trantridge awhile--
young Squire d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville's friend? I was there at that time, though
I don't live there now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) recognized in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the well-to-do boor whom Angel had knocked down
at the inn for addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) coarsely. A spasm of anguish shot
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) returned him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be honest enough to own it, and that what I said in the town was
true, though your fancy-man was so up about it--hey, my sly one? You
ought to beg my pardon for that blow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), considering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Still no answer came from Tess. There seemed only one escape for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
hunted soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) suddenly took to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heels with the speed of the
wind, and, without looking behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), ran along the road till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
came to a gate which opened directly into a plantation. Into this
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) plunged, and did not pause till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was deep enough in its shade
to be safe against any possibility of discovery.

<p/>Under foot the leaves were dry, and the foliage of some holly bushes
which grew among the deciduous trees was dense enough to keep off
draughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) scraped together the dead leaves till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had formed
them into a large heap, making a sort of nest in the middle. Into
this Tess crept.

<p/>Such sleep as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) got was naturally fitful; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard
strange noises, but persuaded herself that they were caused by the
breeze. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband in some vague warm clime on the
other side of the globe, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was here in the cold. Was there
another such a wretched being as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in the world? Tess asked
herself; and, thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wasted life, said, <div class="bookquote">``All is vanity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) repeated the words mechanically, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reflected that this
was a most inadequate thought for modern days. Solomon had thought
as far as that more than two thousand years ago; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) herself,
though not in the van of thinkers, had got much further. If all
were only vanity, who would mind it? All was, alas, worse than
vanity--injustice, punishment, exaction, death. The wife of Angel
Clare put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brow, and felt its curve, and the edges of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eye-sockets perceptible under the soft skin, and thought as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
did so that a time would come when that bone would be bare. <div class="bookquote">``I wish
it were now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.

<p/>In the midst of these whimsical fancies she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heard a new strange sound
among the leaves. It might be the wind; yet there was scarcely any
wind. Sometimes it was a palpitation, sometimes a flutter; sometimes
it was a sort of gasp or gurgle. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was certain that the
noises came from wild creatures of some kind, the more so when,
originating in the boughs overhead, they were followed by the fall
of a heavy body upon the ground. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) been ensconced here under
other and more pleasant conditions she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have become alarmed;
but, outside humanity, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had at present no fear.

<p/>Day at length broke in the sky. When it had been day aloft for some
little while it became day in the wood.

<p/>Directly the assuring and prosaic light of the world's active hours
had grown strong, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crept from under her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hillock of leaves, and
looked around boldly. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) perceived what had been going on to
disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The plantation wherein she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had taken shelter ran down
at this spot into a peak, which ended it hitherward, outside the
hedge being arable ground. Under the trees several pheasants lay
about, their rich plumage dabbled with blood; some were dead, some
feebly twitching a wing, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating
quickly, some contorted, some stretched out--all of them writhing in
agony, except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the
night by the inability of nature to bear more.

<p/>Tess guessed at once the meaning of this. The birds had been driven
down into this corner the day before by some shooting-party; and
while those that had dropped dead under the shot, or had died before
nightfall, had been searched for and carried off, many badly wounded
birds had escaped and hidden themselves away, or risen among the
thick boughs, where they had maintained their position till they grew
weaker with loss of blood in the night-time, when they had fallen one
by one as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had heard them.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had occasionally caught glimpses of these men in girlhood,
looking over hedges, or peeping through bushes, and pointing their
guns, strangely accoutred, a bloodthirsty light in their eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had been told that, rough and brutal as they seemed just then, they
were not like this all the year round, but were, in fact, quite civil
persons save during certain weeks of autumn and winter, when, like
the inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula, they ran amuck, and made
it their purpose to destroy life--in this case harmless feathered
creatures, brought into being by artificial means solely to gratify
these propensities--at once so unmannerly and so unchivalrous towards
their weaker fellows in Nature's teeming family.

<p/>With the impulse of a soul who could feel for kindred sufferers as
much as for herself, Tess's first thought was to put the still living
birds out of their torture, and to this end with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own hands she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
broke the necks of as many as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could find, leaving them to lie
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had found them till the game-keepers should come--as they
probably would come--to look for them a second time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor darlings--to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth
in the sight o' such misery as yours!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) exclaimed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tears
running down as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) killed the birds tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``And not a twinge of
bodily pain about me! I be not mangled, and I be not bleeding, and
I have two hands to feed and clothe me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was ashamed of herself
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gloom of the night, based on nothing more tangible than a
sense of condemnation under an arbitrary law of society which had no
foundation in Nature.



<p/>XLII


<p/>It was now broad day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) started again, emerging cautiously upon
the highway. But there was no need for caution; not a soul was at
hand, and Tess went onward with fortitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) recollection of the
birds' silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
the relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
could once rise high enough to despise opinion. But that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
not do so long as it was held by Clare.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reached Chalk-Newton, and breakfasted at an inn, where several
young men were troublesomely complimentary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) good looks.
Somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt hopeful, for was it not possible that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband
also might say these same things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) even yet? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was bound to
take care of herself on the chance of it, and keep off these casual
lovers. To this end Tess resolved to run no further risks from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
appearance. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) got out of the village she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) entered a
thicket and took from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) basket one of the oldest field-gowns, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had never put on even at the dairy--never since she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had worked
among the stubble at Marlott. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) also, by a felicitous thought,
took a handkerchief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bundle and tied it round her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bonnet, covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) chin and half her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheeks and temples, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) were suffering from toothache. Then with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) little scissors,
by the aid of a pocket looking-glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mercilessly nipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
eyebrows off, and thus insured against aggressive admiration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
went on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) uneven way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a mommet of a maid!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the next man who met her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to a
companion.

<p/>Tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes for very pity of herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't care!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``O no--I don't care! I'll always be
ugly now, because Angel is not here, and I have nobody to take care
of me. My husband that was is gone away, and never will love me any
more; but I love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) just the same, and hate all other men, and like
to make 'em think scornfully of me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus Tess walks on; a figure which is part of the landscape; a
fieldwoman pure and simple, in winter guise; a gray serge cape, a
red woollen cravat, a stuff skirt covered by a whitey-brown rough
wrapper, and buff-leather gloves. Every thread of that old attire
has become faded and thin under the stroke of raindrops, the burn of
sunbeams, and the stress of winds. There is no sign of young passion
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) now--


<p/>The maiden's mouth is cold
...
Fold over simple fold
Binding her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head.


<p/>Inside this exterior, over which the eye might have roved as over a
thing scarcely percipient, almost inorganic, there was the record of
a pulsing life which had learnt too well, for its years, of the dust
and ashes of things, of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of
love.

<p/>Next day the weather was bad, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) trudged on, the honesty,
directness, and impartiality of elemental enmity disconcerting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
but little. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) object being a winter's occupation and a winter's
home, there was no time to lose. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) experience of short hirings
had been such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was determined to accept no more.

<p/>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went forward from farm to farm in the direction of the place
whence Marian had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>), which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) determined to make use of
as a last shift only, its rumoured stringencies being the reverse of
tempting. First she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) inquired for the lighter kinds of employment,
and, as acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless, applied
next for the less light, till, beginning with the dairy and poultry
tendance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) liked best, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) ended with the heavy and course
pursuits which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) liked least--work on arable land: work of such
roughness, indeed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) would never have deliberately voluteered
for.

<p/>Towards the second evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) reached the irregular chalk table-land
or plateau, bosomed with semi-globular tumuli--as if Cybele the
Many-breasted were supinely extended there--which stretched between
the valley of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) birth and the valley of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) love.

<p/>Here the air was dry and cold, and the long cart-roads were blown
white and dusty within a few hours after rain. There were few trees,
or none, those that would have grown in the hedges being mercilessly
plashed down with the quickset by the tenant-farmers, the natural
enemies of tree, bush, and brake. In the middle distance ahead of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) could see the summits of Bulbarrow and of Nettlecombe Tout,
and they seemed friendly. They had a low and unassuming aspect from
this upland, though as approached on the other side from Blackmoor
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) childhood they were as lofty bastions against the sky.
Southerly, at many miles' distance, and over the hills and ridges
coastward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) could discern a surface like polished steel: it was
the English Channel at a point far out towards France.

<p/>Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>), in a slight depression, were the remains of a village.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) had, in fact, reached Flintcomb-Ash, the place of Marian's
sojourn. There seemed to be no help for it; hither she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) was doomed to
come. The stubborn soil around her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) showed plainly enough that the
kind of labour in demand here was of the roughest kind; but it was
time to rest from searching, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) resolved to stay, particularly
as it began to rain. At the entrance to the village was a cottage
whose gable jutted into the road, and before applying for a lodging
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) stood under its shelter, and watched the evening close in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would think I was Mrs Angel Clare!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) said.

<p/>The wall felt warm to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) back and shoulders, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) found that
immediately within the gable was the cottage fireplace, the heat of
which came through the bricks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) hands upon them, and
also put her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) cheek--red and moist with the drizzle--against their
comforting surface. The wall seemed to be the only friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) had.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) had so little wish to leave it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) could have stayed there
all night.

<p/>Tess could hear the occupants of the cottage--gathered together after
their day's labour--talking to each other within, and the rattle of
their supper-plates was also audible. But in the village-street she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had seen no soul as yet. The solitude was at last broken by the
approach of one feminine figure, who, though the evening was cold,
wore the print gown and the tilt-bonnet of summer time. Tess
instinctively thought it might be Marian, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came near
enough to be distinguishable in the gloom, surely enough it was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Marian was even stouter and redder in the face than formerly,
and decidedly shabbier in attire. At any previous period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)
existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in
such conditions; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) loneliness was excessive, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) responded
readily to Marian's greeting.

<p/>Marian was quite respectful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) inquiries, but seemed much moved
by the fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition
than at first; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had dimly heard of the separation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess--Mrs Clare--the dear wife of dear he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)! And is it really so bad

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild
thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you've got no collar on''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Tess had been accustomed to wear a

 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div><p/>Marian paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you BE a gentleman's wife; and it seems hardly fair that you
should live like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes it is, quite fair; though I am very unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well. HE (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) married you--and you can be unhappy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div><p/>Marian, who was really a trustworthy girl though of coarser grain
than Tess, promised anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is pay-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and if you were to come with me you

because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s away, I know. You couldn't be unhappy if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) were here,
even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) gie'd ye no money--even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) used you like a drudge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true; I could not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked on together and soon reached the farmhouse, which was
almost sublime in its dreariness. There was not a tree within sight;
there was not, at this season, a green pasture--nothing but fallow
and turnips everywhere, in large fields divided by hedges plashed to
unrelieved levels.

<p/>Tess waited outside the door of the farmhouse till the group of
workfolk had received their wages, and then Marian introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>).
The farmer himself, it appeared, was not at home, but his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wife, who
represented him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) this evening, made no objection to hiring Tess, on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) agreeing to remain till Old Lady-Day. Female field-labour was
seldom offered now, and its cheapness made it profitable for tasks
which women could perform as readily as men.

<p/>Having signed the agreement, there was nothing more for Tess to do
at present than to get a lodging, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found one in the house at
whose gable-wall she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had warmed herself. It was a poor subsistence
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had ensured, but it would afford a shelter for the winter
at any rate.

<p/>That night she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wrote to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) new address, in
case a letter should arrive at Marlott from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
did not tell them of the sorriness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) situation: it might have
brought reproach upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).



<p/>XLIII


<p/>There was no exaggeration in Marian's definition of Flintcomb-Ash
farm as a starve-acre place. The single fat thing on the soil was
Marian herself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) was an importation. Of the three classes of
village, the village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by
itself, and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord
-LRB-in other words, the village of a resident squires's tenantry, the
village of free- or copy-holders, and the absentee-owner's village,
farmed with the land-RRB- this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third.

<p/>But Tess set to work. Patience, that blending of moral courage with
physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel
Clare; and it sustained her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>).

<p/>The swede-field in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) companion were set hacking was
a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground
of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets--the outcrop of
siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose
white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes. The upper half
of each turnip had been eaten off by the live-stock, and it was the
business of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the
root with a hooked fork called a hacker, that it might be eaten also.
Every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed, the whole
field was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion without
features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse
of skin. The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness; a white
vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone. So these two upper
and nether visages confronted each other all day long, the white face
looking down on the brown face, and the brown face looking up at the
white face, without anything standing between them but the two girls
crawling over the surface of the former like flies.

<p/>Nobody came near them, and their movements showed a mechanical
regularity; their forms standing enshrouded in Hessian <div class="bookquote">``wroppers'' (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div>--
sleeved brown pinafores, tied behind to the bottom, to keep their
gowns from blowing about--scant skirts revealing boots that reached
high up the ankles, and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets. The
pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads
would have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception of
the two Marys.

<p/>They worked on hour after hour, unconscious of the forlorn aspect
they bore in the landscape, not thinking of the justice or injustice
of their lot. Even in such a position as theirs it was possible
to exist in a dream. In the afternoon the rain came on again, and
Marian said that they need not work any more. But if they did not
work they would not be paid; so they worked on. It was so high a
situation, this field, that the rain had no occasion to fall, but
raced along horizontally upon the yelling wind, sticking into them
like glass splinters till they were wet through. Tess had not
known till now what was really meant by that. There are degrees of
dampness, and a very little is called being wet through in common
talk. But to stand working slowly in a field, and feel the creep of
rain-water, first in legs and shoulders, then on hips and head, then
at back, front, and sides, and yet to work on till the leaden light
diminishes and marks that the sun is down, demands a distinct modicum
of stoicism, even of valour.

<p/>Yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed. They
were both young, and they were talking of the time when they lived
and loved together at Talbothays Dairy, that happy green tract of
land where summer had been liberal in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) gifts; in substance to
all, emotionally to these. Tess would fain not have conversed with
Marian of the man who was legally, if not actually, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) husband;
but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) into
reciprocating Marian's remarks. And thus, as has been said, though
the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces,
and their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness, they lived all
this afternoon in memories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o' Froom Valley
from here when `tis fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Can you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, awake to the new value of this locality.

<p/>So the two forces were at work here as everywhere, the inherent will
to enjoy, and the circumstantial will against enjoyment. Marian's
will had a method of assisting itself by taking from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) pocket as
the afternoon wore on a pint bottle corked with white rag, from which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) invited Tess to drink. Tess's unassisted power of dreaming,
however, being enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sublimation at present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) declined
except the merest sip, and then Marian took a pull from the spirits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got used to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) said, ``and can't leave it off now. <div class="bookquote">``Tis
my only comfort--You see I lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>): you didn't; and you can do
without it perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) loss as great as Marian's, but upheld by the dignity
of being Angel's wife, in the letter at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) accepted Marian's
differentiation.

<p/>Amid this scene Tess slaved in the morning frosts and in
the afternoon rains. When it was not swede-grubbing it was
swede-trimming, in which process they sliced off the earth and the
fibres with a bill-hook before storing the roots for future use. At
this occupation they could shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if
it rained; but if it was frosty even their thick leather gloves could
not prevent the frozen masses they handled from biting their fingers.
Still Tess hoped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had a conviction that sooner or later the
magnanimity which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient
of Clare's character would lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to rejoin her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>Marian, primed to a humorous mood, would discover the queer-shaped
flints aforesaid, and shriek with laughter, Tess remaining severely
obtuse. They often looked across the country to where the Var or
Froom was know to stretch, even though they might not be able to see
it; and, fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist, imagined the
old times they had spent out there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian, <div class="bookquote">``how I should like another or two of our old set
to come here! Then we could bring up Talbothays every day here
afield, and talk of he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and of what nice times we had there, and o'
the old things we used to know, and make it all come back a`most, in
seeming!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>Marian's eyes softened, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) voice grew vague as the
visions returned. <div class="bookquote">``I'll write to Izz Huett,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s
biding at home doing nothing now, I know, and I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) we be
here, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to come; and perhaps Retty is well enough now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess had nothing to say against the proposal, and the next she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard
of this plan for importing old Talbothays' joys was two or three days
later, when Marian informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) that Izz had replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) inquiry,
and had promised to come if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) could.

<p/>There had not been such a winter for years. It came on in stealthy
and measured glides, like the moves of a chess-player. One morning
the few lonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared as if
they had put off a vegetable for an animal integument. Every twig
was covered with a white nap as of fur grown from the rind during the
night, giving it four times its usual stoutness; the whole bush or
tree forming a staring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray
of the sky and horizon. Cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds
and walls where none had ever been observed till brought out into
visibility by the crystallizing atmosphere, hanging like loops of
white worsted from salient points of the out-houses, posts, and
gates.

<p/>After this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost,
when strange birds from behind the North Pole began to arrive
silently on the upland of Flintcomb-Ash; gaunt spectral creatures
with tragical eyes--eyes which had witnessed scenes of cataclysmal
horror in inaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human
being had ever conceived, in curdling temperatures that no man could
endure; which had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of
snow-hills by the shooting light of the Aurora; been half blinded
by the whirl of colossal storms and terraqueous distortions; and
retained the expression of feature that such scenes had engendered.
These nameless birds came quite near to Tess and Marian, but of
all they had seen which humanity would never see, they brought no
account. The traveller's ambition to tell was not theirs, and, with
dumb impassivity, they dismissed experiences which they did not
value for the immediate incidents of this homely upland--the trivial
movements of the two girls in disturbing the clods with their hackers
so as to uncover something or other that these visitants relished as
food.

<p/>Then one day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country.
There came a moisture which was not of rain, and a cold which was not
of frost. It chilled the eyeballs of the twain, made their brows
ache, penetrated to their skeletons, affecting the surface of the
body less than its core. They knew that it meant snow, and in the
night the snow came. Tess, who continued to live at the cottage with
the warm gable that cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside
it, awoke in the night, and heard above the thatch noises which
seemed to signify that the roof had turned itself into a gymnasium
of all the winds. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lit her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lamp to get up in the morning
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found that the snow had blown through a chink in the casement,
forming a white cone of the finest powder against the inside, and had
also come down the chimney, so that it lay sole-deep upon the floor,
on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shoes left tracks when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) moved about. Without, the
storm drove so fast as to create a snow-mist in the kitchen; but as
yet it was too dark out-of-doors to see anything.

<p/>Tess knew that it was impossible to go on with the swedes; and by
the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp,
Marian arrived to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) that they were to join the rest of the
women at reed-drawing in the barn till the weather changed. As soon,
therefore, as the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn
to a disordered medley of grays, they blew out the lamp, wrapped
themselves up in their thickest pinners, tied their woollen cravats
round their necks and across their chests, and started for the barn.
The snow had followed the birds from the polar basin as a white
pillar of a cloud, and individual flakes could not be seen. The
blast smelt of icebergs, arctic seas, whales, and white bears,
carrying the snow so that it licked the land but did not deepen on
it. They trudged onwards with slanted bodies through the flossy
fields, keeping as well as they could in the shelter of hedges,
which, however, acted as strainers rather than screens. The air,
afflicted to pallor with the hoary multitudes that infested it,
twisted and spun them eccentrically, suggesting an achromatic chaos
of things. But both the young women were fairly cheerful; such
weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha-ha! the cunning northern birds knew this was coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said
Marian. <div class="bookquote">``Depend upon't, they keep just in front o't all the way from
the North Star. Your husband, my dear, is, I make no doubt, having
scorching weather all this time. Lord, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could only see his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
pretty wife now! Not that this weather hurts your beauty at all--in
fact, it rather does it good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to me, Marian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess severely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but--surely you care for`n! Do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of answering, Tess, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes, impulsively faced
in the direction in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) imagined South America to lie, and,
putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips, blew out a passionate kiss upon the snowy wind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, I know you do. But `pon my body, it is a rum life for
a married couple! There--I won't say another word! Well, as for
the weather, it won't hurt us in the wheat-barn; but reed-drawing is
fearful hard work--worse than swede-hacking. I can stand it because
I'm stout; but you be slimmer than I. I can't think why maister
should have set `ee at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They reached the wheat-barn and entered it. One end of the long
structure was full of corn; the middle was where the reed-drawing was
carried on, and there had already been placed in the reed-press the
evening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for
the women to draw from during the day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, here's Izz!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian.

<p/>Izz it was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) came forward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) had walked all the way from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) mother's home on the previous afternoon, and, not deeming the
distance so great, had been belated, arriving, however, just before
the snow began, and sleeping at the alehouse. The farmer had agreed
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) mother at market to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) on if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) came to-day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)
had been afraid to disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) by delay.

<p/>In addition to Tess, Marian, and Izz, there were two women from a
neighbouring village; two Amazonian sisters, whom Tess with a start
remembered as Dark Car, the Queen of Spades, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) junior, the
Queen of Diamonds--those who had tried to fight with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) in the
midnight quarrel at Trantridge. They showed no recognition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>),
and possibly had none, for they had been under the influence of
liquor on that occasion, and were only temporary sojourners there
as here. They did all kinds of men's work by preference, including
well-sinking, hedging, ditching, and excavating, without any sense of
fatigue. Noted reed-drawers were they too, and looked round upon the
other three with some superciliousness.

<p/>Putting on their gloves, all set to work in a row in front of the
press, an erection formed of two posts connected by a cross-beam,
under which the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward, the
beam being pegged down by pins in the uprights, and lowered as the
sheaves diminished.

<p/>The day hardened in colour, the light coming in at the barndoors
upwards from the snow instead of downwards from the sky. The girls
pulled handful after handful from the press; but by reason of the
presence of the strange women, who were recounting scandals, Marian
and Izz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do.
Presently they heard the muffled tread of a horse, and the farmer
rode up to the barndoor. When he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had dismounted he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) came close to
Tess, and remained looking musingly at the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
not turned at first, but his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) fixed attitude led her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to look round,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) employer was the native of Trantridge
from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had taken flight on the high-road because of his (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>)
allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) history.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) waited till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``So you be the young woman who took my civility in such
ill part? Be drowned if I didn't think you might be as soon as I
heard of your being hired! Well, you thought you had got the better
of me the first time at the inn with your fancy-man, and the second
time on the road, when you bolted; but now I think I've got the
better you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) concluded with a hard laugh.

<p/>Tess, between the Amazons and the farmer, like a bird caught in a
clap-net, returned no answer, continuing to pull the straw. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
could read character sufficiently well to know by this time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had nothing to fear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) employer's gallantry; it was rather the
tyranny induced by his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mortification at Clare's treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
Upon the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave
enough to endure it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought I was in love with `ee I suppose? Some women are such
fools, to take every look as serious earnest. But there's nothing
like a winter afield for taking that nonsense out o' young wenches'
heads; and you've signed and agreed till Lady-Day. Now, are you
going to beg my pardon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you ought to beg mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--as you like. But we'll see which is master here. Be
they all the sheaves you've done to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a very poor show. Just see what they've done over there''
 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to the two stalwart women-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``The rest, too, have done
better than you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've all practised it before, and I have not. And I thought it
made no difference to you as it is task work, and we are only paid
for what we do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but it does. I want the barn cleared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as
the others will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked sullenly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) and went away. Tess felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
not have come to a much worse place; but anything was better than
gallantry. When two o'clock arrived the professional reed-drawers
tossed off the last half-pint in their flagon, put down their hooks,
tied their last sheaves, and went away. Marian and Izz would have
done likewise, but on hearing that Tess meant to stay, to make up
by longer hours for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lack of skill, they would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).
Looking out at the snow, which still fell, Marian exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Now,
we've got it all to ourselves.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>And so at last the conversation
turned to their old experiences at the dairy; and, of course, the
incidents of their affection for Angel Clare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Izz and Marian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clare/Mrs Angel Clare</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Angel Clare, with a dignity which was
extremely touching, seeing how very little of a wife she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was: <div class="bookquote">``I
can't join in talk with you now, as I used to do, about Mr Clare; you
will see that I cannot; because, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is gone away from me for
the present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is my husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls
who had loved Clare. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was a very splendid lover, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``but I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is a too fond husband to go away from you
so soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had to go--he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was obliged to go, to see about the land over
there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>pleaded Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) might have tided `ee over the winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--that's owing to an accident--a misunderstanding; and we won't
argue it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Tess answered, with tearfulness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) words. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps
there's a good deal to be said for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not go away, like
some husbands, without telling me; and I can always find out where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After this they continued for some long time in a reverie, as they
went on seizing the ears of corn, drawing out the straw, gathering
it under their arms, and cutting off the ears with their bill-hooks,
nothing sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the
crunch of the hook. Then Tess suddenly flagged, and sank down upon
the heap of wheat-ears at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you wouldn't be able to stand it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>cried Marian. <div class="bookquote">``It wants
harder flesh than yours for this work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Just then the farmer entered. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's how you get on when I am
away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is my own loss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``Not yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want it finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) said doggedly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) crossed the barn and
went out at the other door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't `ee mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), there's a dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian. <div class="bookquote">``I've worked here
before. Now you go and lie down there, and Izz and I will make up
your number.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like to let you do that. I'm taller than you, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) was so overcome that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) consented to lie down awhile,
and reclined on a heap of pull-tails--the refuse after the straight
straw had been drawn--thrown up at the further side of the barn. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)
succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the re-opening
the subject of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) separation from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) husband as to the hard work.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) lay in a state of percipience without volition, and the rustle of
the straw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of
bodily touches.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) could hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) corner, in addition to these noises, the
murmur of their voices. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) felt certain that they were continuing
the subject already broached, but their voices were so low that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)
could not catch the words. At last Tess grew more and more anxious
to know what they were saying, and, persuading herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt
better, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) got up and resumed work.

<p/>Then Izz Huett broke down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had walked more than a dozen miles
the previous evening, had gone to bed at midnight, and had risen
again at five o'clock. Marian alone, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) bottle of liquor
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) stoutness of build, stood the strain upon back and arms
without suffering. Tess urged Izz to leave off, agreeing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
felt better, to finish the day without her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and make equal division
of the number of sheaves.

<p/>Izz accepted the offer gratefully, and disappeared through the great
door into the snowy track to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lodging. Marian, as was the case
every afternoon at this time on account of the bottle, began to feel
in a romantic vein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have thought it of him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)--never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) said in a dreamy
tone. <div class="bookquote">``And I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) so! I didn't mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) having YOU. But this
about Izz is too bad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) start at the words, narrowly missed cutting off a finger
with the bill-hook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it about my husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stammered.

<p/>``Well, yes. Izz said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't `ee tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)'; but I am sure I can't
help it! It was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) wanted Izz to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) to go off
to Brazil with him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's face faded as white as the scene without, and its curves
straightened. <div class="bookquote">``And did Izz refuse to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Anyhow he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Pooh--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) didn't mean it! <div class="bookquote">``Twas just a man's jest!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) did; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) a good-ways towards the station.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) didn't take her (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>They pulled on in silence till Tess, without any premonitory
symptoms, burst out crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian. <div class="bookquote">``Now I wish I hadn't told `ee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. It is a very good thing that you have done! I have been living
on in a thirtover, lackaday way, and have not seen what it may lead
to! I ought to have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) a letter oftener. He (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) said I could not
go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) didn't say I was not to write as often as I liked.
I won't dally like this any longer! I have been very wrong and
neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The dim light in the barn grew dimmer, and they could see to work no
longer. When Tess had reached home that evening, and had entered
into the privacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) little white-washed chamber, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) began
impetuously writing a letter to Clare. But falling into doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
could not finish it. Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) took the ring from the ribbon on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wore it next her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart, and retained it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) finger all
night, as if to fortify herself in the sensation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was really
the wife of this elusive lover of hers, who could propose that Izz
should go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) abroad, so shortly after he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). Knowing
that, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) write entreaties to him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>), or show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cared
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) any more?



<p/>XLIV


<p/>By the disclosure in the barn her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thoughts were led anew in the
direction which they had taken more than once of late--to the distant
Emminster Vicarage. It was through her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband's parents that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had been charged to send a letter to Clare if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) desired; and to
write to them direct if in difficulty. But that sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) having
morally no claim upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had always led Tess to suspend her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) impulse
to send these notes; and to the family at the Vicarage, therefore,
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own parents since her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was virtually
non-existent. This self-effacement in both directions had been quite
in consonance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) independent character of desiring nothing
by way of favour or pity to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was not entitled on a fair
consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) deserts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had set herself to stand or fall
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) qualities, and to waive such merely technical claims upon a
strange family as had been established for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) by the flimsy fact of
a member of that family, in a season of impulse, writing his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) name in
a church-book beside hers.

<p/>But now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was stung to a fever by Izz's tale, there was a
limit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) powers of renunciation. Why had her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband not written
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had distinctly implied that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would at least let her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
know of the locality to which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had journeyed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not sent a
line to notify his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) address. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) really indifferent? But was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
ill? Was it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to make some advance? Surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might summon
the courage of solicitude, call at the Vicarage for intelligence, and
express her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) grief at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) silence. If Angel's father were the good
man she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) represented to be, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would be able to enter
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart-starved situation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) social hardships she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
conceal.

<p/>To leave the farm on a week-day was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) power; Sunday was
the only possible opportunity. Flintcomb-Ash being in the middle
of the cretaceous tableland over which no railway had climbed as
yet, it would be necessary to walk. And the distance being fifteen
miles each way she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have to allow herself a long day for the
undertaking by rising early.

<p/>A fortnight later, when the snow had gone, and had been followed by
a hard black frost, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) took advantage of the state of the roads to
try the experiment. At four o'clock that Sunday morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came
downstairs and stepped out into the starlight. The weather was still
favourable, the ground ringing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feet like an anvil.

<p/>Marian and Izz were much interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) excursion, knowing that
the journey concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) husband. Their lodgings were in a cottage
a little further along the lane, but they came and assisted Tess
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) departure, and argued that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) should dress up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) very
prettiest guise to captivate the hearts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents-in-law; though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), knowing of the austere and Calvinistic tenets of old Mr Clare,
was indifferent, and even doubtful. A year had now elapsed since
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sad marriage, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had preserved sufficient draperies from
the wreck of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) then full wardrobe to clothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) very charmingly as
a simple country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion; a soft
gray woollen gown, with white crape quilling against the pink skin of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face and neck, and a black velvet jacket and hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a thousand pities your husband can't see `ee now--you do look
a real beauty!''  (<font color='red'><b>a country girl</b></font>)</div>said Izz Huett, regarding Tess as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stood on
the threshold between the steely starlight without and the yellow
candlelight within. Izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of
herself to the situation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not be--no woman with a heart
bigger than a hazel-nut could be--antagonistic to Tess in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
presence, the influence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) exercised over those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own sex
being of a warmth and strength quite unusual, curiously overpowering
the less worthy feminine feelings of spite and rivalry.

<p/>With a final tug and touch here, and a slight brush there, they let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) go; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was absorbed into the pearly air of the fore-dawn.
They heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) footsteps tap along the hard road as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stepped out
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) full pace. Even Izz hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would win, and, though without
any particular respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own virtue, felt glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
been prevented wronging her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) friend when momentarily tempted by Clare.

<p/>It was a year ago, all but a day, that Clare had married Tess, and
only a few days less than a year that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had been absent from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).
Still, to start on a brisk walk, and on such an errand as hers, on a
dry clear wintry morning, through the rarefied air of these chalky
hogs'-backs, was not depressing; and there is no doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dream
at starting was to win the heart of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother-in-law, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) whole
history to that lady, enlist her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) side, and so gain back the
truant.

<p/>In time she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which
stretched the loamy Vale of Blackmoor, now lying misty and still
in the dawn. Instead of the colourless air of the uplands, the
atmosphere down there was a deep blue. Instead of the great
enclosures of a hundred acres in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was now accustomed to
toil, there were little fields below her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) of less than half-a-dozen
acres, so numerous that they looked from this height like the meshes
of a net. Here the landscape was whitey-brown; down there, as in
Froom Valley, it was always green. Yet it was in that vale that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
sorrow had taken shape, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not love it as formerly. Beauty
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), as to all who have felt, lay not in the thing, but in what
the thing symbolized.

<p/>Keeping the Vale on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) steered steadily westward; passing
above the Hintocks, crossing at right-angles the high-road from
Sherton-Abbas to Casterbridge, and skirting Dogbury Hill and
High-Stoy, with the dell between them called <div class="bookquote">``The Devil's Kitchen'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>.
Still following the elevated way she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reached Cross-in-Hand, where
the stone pillar stands desolate and silent, to mark the site of a
miracle, or murder, or both. Three miles further she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cut across the
straight and deserted Roman road called Long-Ash Lane; leaving which
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reached it she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dipped down a hill by a transverse lane
into the small town or village of Evershead, being now about halfway
over the distance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) made a halt here, and breakfasted a second
time, heartily enough--not at the Sow-and-Acorn, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) avoided
inns, but at a cottage by the church.

<p/>The second half of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) journey was through a more gentle country, by
way of Benvill Lane. But as the mileage lessened between her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) and the
spot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pilgrimage, so did Tess's confidence decrease, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
enterprise loom out more formidably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) purpose in such
staring lines, and the landscape so faintly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was sometimes
in danger of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) way. However, about noon she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) paused by a
gate on the edge of the basin in which Emminster and its Vicarage
lay.

<p/>The square tower, beneath which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew that at that moment the
Vicar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) congregation were gathered, had a severe look in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had somehow contrived to come on a
week-day. Such a good man might be prejudiced against a woman who
had chosen Sunday, never realizing the necessities of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) case.
But it was incumbent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to go on now. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took off the thick
boots in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had walked thus far, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretty thin ones
of patent leather, and, stuffing the former into the hedge by the
gatepost where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might readily find them again, descended the hill;
the freshness of colour she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had derived from the keen air thinning
away in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew near the parsonage.

<p/>Tess hoped for some accident that might favour her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), but nothing
favoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). The shrubs on the Vicarage lawn rustled uncomfortably
in the frosty breeze; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not feel by any stretch of
imagination, dressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) highest as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, that the house was
the residence of near relations; and yet nothing essential, in nature
or emotion, divided her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from them: in pains, pleasures, thoughts,
birth, death, and after-death, they were the same.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) nerved herself by an effort, entered the swing-gate, and rang
the door-bell. The thing was done; there could be no retreat. No;
the thing was not done. Nobody answered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ringing. The effort
had to be risen to and made again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) rang a second time, and the
agitation of the act, coupled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) weariness after the fifteen
miles' walk, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to support herself while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) waited by resting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hip and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) elbow against the wall of the porch. The
wind was so nipping that the ivy-leaves had become wizened and gray,
each tapping incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) nerves. A piece of blood-stained paper, caught up from some
meat-buyer's dust-heap, beat up and down the road without the gate;
too flimsy to rest, too heavy to fly away; and a few straws kept it
company.

<p/>The second peal had been louder, and still nobody came. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
walked out of the porch, opened the gate, and passed through. And
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked dubiously at the house-front as if inclined to
return, it was with a breath of relied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) closed the gate. A
feeling haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might have been recognized -LRB-though how
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not tell-RRB-, and orders been given not to admit her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>Tess went as far as the corner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had done all she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could do; but
determined not to escape present trepidation at the expense of future
distress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walked back again quite past the house, looking up at
all the windows.

<p/>Ah--the explanation was that they were all at church, every one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father always insisted upon
the household, servants included, going to morning-service, and,
as a consequence, eating cold food when they came home. It was,
therefore, only necessary to wait till the service was over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
would not make herself conspicuous by waiting on the spot, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
started to get past the church into the lane. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reached the
churchyard-gate the people began pouring out, and Tess found herself
in the midst of them.

<p/>The Emminster congregation looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as only a congregation of
small country-townsfolk walking home at its leisure can look at a
woman out of the common whom it perceives to be a stranger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pace, and ascended the road by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had come,
to find a retreat between its hedges till the Vicar's family should
have lunched, and it might be convenient for them to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soon distanced the churchgoers, except two youngish men, who,
linked arm-in-arm, were beating up behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at a quick step.

<p/>As they drew nearer she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could hear their voices engaged in earnest
discourse, and, with the natural quickness of a woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
situation, did not fail to recognize in those noises the quality
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's tones. The pedestrians were his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) two brothers.
Forgetting all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plans, Tess's one dread was lest they should
overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) disorganized condition, before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
prepared to confront them; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt that they could not
identify her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) instinctively dreaded their scrutiny. The more
briskly they walked, the more briskly walked she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). They were plainly
bent upon taking a short quick stroll before going indoors to lunch
or dinner, to restore warmth to limbs chilled with sitting through a
long service.

<p/>Only one person had preceded Tess up the hill--a ladylike young
woman, somewhat interesting, though, perhaps, a trifle _guindée_
and prudish. Tess had nearly overtaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) when the speed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
brothers-in-law brought them so nearly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) back that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
hear every word of their conversation. They said nothing, however,
which particularly interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) till, observing the young lady
still further in front, one of them remarked, <div class="bookquote">``There is Mercy Chant.
Let us overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess knew the name. It was the woman who had been destined for
Angel's life-companion by his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) probably
would have married but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) intrusive self. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have known
as much without previous information if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had waited a moment, for
one of the brothers proceeded to say: <div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor Angel, poor Angel!
I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may be. It is a queer business, apparently. Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has
joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) yet or not I don't know; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not done so some
months ago when I heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the brothers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) never tells me anything nowadays. His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
ill-considered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement
from me which was begun by his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) extraordinary opinions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess beat up the long hill still faster; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not outwalk
them without exciting notice. At last they outsped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) altogether,
and passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) by. The young lady still further ahead heard their
footsteps and turned. Then there was a greeting and a shaking of
hands, and the three went on together.

<p/>They soon reached the summit of the hill, and, evidently intending
this point to be the limit of their promenade, slackened pace and
turned all three aside to the gate whereat Tess had paused an hour
before that time to reconnoitre the town before descending into it.
During their discourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge
carefully with his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) umbrella, and dragged something to light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a pair of old boots,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Thrown away, I suppose, by
some tramp or other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some imposter who wished to come into the town barefoot, perhaps,
and so excite our sympathies,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Chant. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it must have
been, for they are excellent walking-boots--by no means worn out.
What a wicked thing to do! I'll carry them home for some poor
person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cuthbert</b></font>)</div><p/>Cuthbert Clare, who had been the one to find them, picked them up for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) with the crook of his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) stick; and Tess's boots were appropriated.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), who had heard this, walked past under the screen of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) woollen
veil till, presently looking back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) perceived that the church
party had left the gate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) boots and retreated down the hill.

<p/>Thereupon our heroine resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) walk. Tears, blinding tears, were
running down her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) knew that it was all sentiment, all
baseless impressibility, which had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) to read the scene as
her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) own condemnation; nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) could not get over it; she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
could not contravene in her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) own defenceless person all those untoward
omens. It was impossible to think of returning to the Vicarage.
Angel's wife felt almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been hounded up that hill like
a scorned thing by those--to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--superfine clerics. Innocently
as the slight had been inflicted, it was somewhat unfortunate that
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had encountered the sons and not the father, who, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
narrowness, was far less starched and ironed than they, and had to
the full the gift of charity. As she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dusty
boots she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) almost pitied those habiliments for the quizzing to which
they had been subjected, and felt how hopeless life was for their
owner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, still sighing in pity of herself, <div class="bookquote">``THEY didn't know
that I wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these
pretty ones HE (<font color='blue'><b>imposter</b></font>) bought for me--no--they did not know it! And they
didn't think that HE (<font color='blue'><b>imposter</b></font>) chose the colour o' my pretty frock--no--how
could they? If they had known perhaps they would not have cared,
for they don't care much for him (<font color='blue'><b>imposter</b></font>), poor thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of
judgement had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all these latter sorrows; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
way without knowing that the greatest misfortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life was this
feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
estimating her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father-in-law by his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) sons. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) present condition was
precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old Mr and
Mrs Clare. Their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme
cases, when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among
mankind failed to win their interest or regard. In jumping at
Publicans and Sinners they would forget that a word might be said for
the worries of Scribes and Pharisees; and this defect or limitation
might have recommended their own daughter-in-law to them at this
moment as a fairly choice sort of lost person for their love.

<p/>Thereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) began to plod back along the road by which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) had come
not altogether full of hope, but full of a conviction that a crisis
in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) life was approaching. No crisis, apparently, had supervened;
and there was nothing left for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) to do but to continue upon that
starve-acre farm till she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) could again summon courage to face the
Vicarage. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) did, indeed, take sufficient interest in herself to
throw up her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) veil on this return journey, as if to let the world see
that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) could at least exhibit a face such as Mercy Chant could
not show. But it was done with a sorry shake of the head. <div class="bookquote">``It is
nothing--it is nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody loves it; nobody sees it.
Who cares about the looks of a castaway like me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) journey back was rather a meander than a march. It had no
sprightliness, no purpose; only a tendency. Along the tedious length
of Benvill Lane she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) began to grow tired, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) leant upon gates and
paused by milestones.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) did not enter any house till, at the seventh or eighth mile, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>)
descended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet
of Evershead, where in the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) had breakfasted with such
contrasting expectations. The cottage by the church, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>)
again sat down, was almost the first at that end of the village, and
while the woman fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) some milk from the pantry, Tess, looking
down the street, perceived that the place seemed quite deserted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The people are gone to afternoon service, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis too soon for that; the
bells hain't strook out yet. They be all gone to hear the preaching
in yonder barn. A ranter preaches there between the services--an
excellent, fiery, Christian man, they say. But, Lord, I don't go to
hear`n! What comes in the regular way over the pulpit is hot enough
for I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess soon went onward into the village, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) footsteps echoing against
the houses as though it were a place of the dead. Nearing the
central part, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) echoes were intruded on by other sounds; and seeing
the barn not far off the road, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) guessed these to be the utterances
of the preacher.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
soon catch his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) sentences, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was on the closed side of
the barn. The sermon, as might be expected, was of the extremest
antinomian type; on justification by faith, as expounded in the
theology of St Paul. This fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered
with animated enthusiasm, in a manner entirely declamatory, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had plainly no skill as a dialectician. Although Tess had not heard
the beginning of the address, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) learnt what the text had been from
its constant iteration--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``O foolish galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye
should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ
hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess was all the more interested, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stood listening behind, in
finding that the preacher's doctrine was a vehement form of the view
of Angel's father, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) interest intensified when the speaker
began to detail his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) own spiritual experiences of how he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had come by
those views. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) said, been the greatest of sinners. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had
scoffed; he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had wantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd.
But a day of awakening had come, and, in a human sense, it had been
brought about mainly by the influence of a certain clergyman, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
had at first grossly insulted; but whose parting words had sunk into
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) heart, and had remained there, till by the grace of Heaven they
had worked this change in him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) what they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>).

<p/>But more startling to Tess than the doctrine had been the voice,
which, impossible as it seemed, was precisely that of Alec
d``Urberville. Her (<font color='blue'><b>imposter</b></font>) face fixed in painful suspense, she (<font color='blue'><b>imposter</b></font>) came round
to the front of the barn, and passed before it. The low winter sun
beamed directly upon the great double-doored entrance on this side;
one of the doors being open, so that the rays stretched far in over
the threshing-floor to the preacher and his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) audience, all snugly
sheltered from the northern breeze. The listeners were entirely
villagers, among them being the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>imposter</b></font>) had seen carrying the
red paint-pot on a former memorable occasion. But her (<font color='blue'><b>imposter</b></font>) attention
was given to the central figure, who stood upon some sacks of corn,
facing the people and the door. The three o'clock sun shone full
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and the strange enervating conviction that her (<font color='blue'><b>imposter</b></font>) seducer
confronted her (<font color='blue'><b>imposter</b></font>), which had been gaining ground in Tess ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words distinctly, was at last established as a fact
indeed.


<p/>END OF PHASE THE FIFTH





<p/>Phase the Sixth: The Convert



<p/>XLV


<p/>Till this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had never seen or heard from d``Urberville since
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) departure from Trantridge.

<p/>The rencounter came at a heavy moment, one of all moments calculated
to permit its impact with the least emotional shock. But such was
unreasoning memory that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood there openly and palpably a
converted man, who was sorrowing for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past irregularities, a fear
overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), paralyzing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) movement so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) neither retreated
nor advanced.

<p/>To think of what emanated from that countenance when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw it last,
and to behold it now! ... There was the same handsome unpleasantness
of mien, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore neatly trimmed, old-fashioned whiskers, the
sable moustache having disappeared; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dress was half-clerical,
a modification which had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expression sufficiently to
abstract the dandyism from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features, and to hinder for a second
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) belief in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) identity.

<p/>To Tess's sense there was, just at first, a ghastly _bizarrerie_,
a grim incongruity, in the march of these solemn words of Scripture
out of such a mouth. This too familiar intonation, less than four
years earlier, had brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ears expressions of such divergent
purpose that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart became quite sick at the irony of the
contrast.

<p/>It was less a reform than a transfiguration. The former curves of
sensuousness were now modulated to lines of devotional passion.
The lip-shapes that had meant seductiveness were now made to
express supplication; the glow on the cheek that yesterday could be
translated as riotousness was evangelized to-day into the splendour
of pious rhetoric; animalism had become fanaticism; Paganism,
Paulinism; the bold rolling eye that had flashed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) form in
the old time with such mastery now beamed with the rude energy of a
theolatry that was almost ferocious. Those black angularities which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face had used to put on when his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wishes were thwarted now did
duty in picturing the incorrigible backslider who would insist upon
turning again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wallowing in the mire.

<p/>The lineaments, as such, seemed to complain. They had been diverted
from their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which
Nature did not intend them. Strange that their very elevation was a
misapplication, that to raise seemed to falsify.

<p/>Yet could it be so? She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) would admit the ungenerous sentiment no
longer. D``Urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned
away from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wickedness to save his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul alive, and why should she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
deem it unnatural in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? It was but the usage of thought which had
been jarred in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) at hearing good new words in bad old notes. The
greater the sinner, the greater the saint; it was not necessary to
dive far into Christian history to discover that.

<p/>Such impressions as these moved her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) vaguely, and without strict
definiteness. As soon as the nerveless pause of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) surprise would
allow her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) to stir, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) impulse was to pass on out of his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>)
had obviously not discerned her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) yet in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) position against the sun.

<p/>But the moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) moved again he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). The effect
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) old lover was electric, far stronger than the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>)
presence upon her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) fire, the tumultuous ring of his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) eloquence,
seemed to go out of him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) lip struggled and trembled under the
words that lay upon it; but deliver them it could not as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
faced him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) eyes, after their first glance upon her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) face, hung
confusedly in every other direction but hers, but came back in a
desperate leap every few seconds. This paralysis lasted, however,
but a short time; for Tess's energies returned with the atrophy of
his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walked as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was able past the barn and onward.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could reflect, it appalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), this change in their
relative platforms. He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) who had wrought her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) undoing was now on the
side of the Spirit, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) remained unregenerate. And, as in the
legend, it had resulted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) Cyprian image had suddenly appeared
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) altar, whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh
extinguished.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went on without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) back seemed to be endowed
with a sensitiveness to ocular beams--even her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) clothing--so alive
was she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from the
outside of that barn. All the way along to this point her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heart
had been heavy with an inactive sorrow; now there was a change in
the quality of its trouble. That hunger for affection too long
withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense
of an implacable past which still engirdled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). It intensified
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) consciousness of error to a practical despair; the break of
continuity between her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) earlier and present existence, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
hoped for, had not, after all, taken place. Bygones would never be
complete bygones till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was a bygone herself.

<p/>Thus absorbed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) recrossed the northern part of Long-Ash Lane at
right angles, and presently saw before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) the road ascending whitely
to the upland along whose margin the remainder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) journey lay.
Its dry pale surface stretched severely onward, unbroken by a single
figure, vehicle, or mark, save some occasional brown horse-droppings
which dotted its cold aridity here and there. While slowly breasting
this ascent Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and
turning she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw approaching that well-known form--so strangely
accoutred as the Methodist--the one personage in all the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave.

<p/>There was not much time, however, for thought or elusion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
yielded as calmly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could to the necessity of letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was excited, less by the speed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
walk than by the feelings within him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) slackened speed without looking round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``It is I--Alec d'Urberville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) then looked back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) came up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--is that all? Yet I deserve no more! Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) added,
with a slight laugh, <div class="bookquote">``there is something of the ridiculous to your
eyes in seeing me like this. But--I must put up with that. ... I
heard you had gone away; nobody knew where. Tess, you wonder why I
have followed you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, rather; and I would that you had not, with all my heart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--you may well say it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) returned grimly, as they moved onward
together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with unwilling tread. <div class="bookquote">``But don't mistake me; I beg
this because you may have been led to do so in noticing--if you did
notice it--how your sudden appearance unnerved me down there. It was
but a momentary faltering; and considering what you have been to me,
it was natural enough. But will helped me through it--though perhaps
you think me a humbug for saying it--and immediately afterwards I
felt that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire
to save from the wrath to come--sneer if you like--the woman whom I
had so grievously wronged was that person. I have come with that
sole purpose in view--nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was the smallest vein of scorn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) words of rejoinder: <div class="bookquote">``Have
you saved yourself? Charity begins at home, they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ have done nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) indifferently. ``Heaven, as I have
been telling my hearers, has done all. No amount of contempt that
you can pour upon me, Tess, will equal what I have poured upon
myself--the old Adam of my former years! Well, it is a strange
story; believe it or not; but I can tell you the means by which my
conversion was brought about, and I hope you will be interested
enough at least to listen. Have you ever heard the name of the
parson of Emminster--you must have done do?--old Mr Clare; one of the
most earnest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) school; one of the few intense men left in the
Church; not so intense as the extreme wing of Christian believers
with which I have thrown in my lot, but quite an exception among the
Established clergy, the younger of whom are gradually attenuating the
true doctrines by their sophistries, till they are but the shadow of
what they were. I only differ from him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) on the question of Church and
State--the interpretation of the text, <div class="bookquote">``Come out from among them and
be ye separate, saith the Lord'--that's all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is one who, I firmly
believe, has been the humble means of saving more souls in this
country than any other man you can name. You have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to Trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of
some missionary society; and I, wretched fellow that I was, insulted
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) when, in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) disinterestedness, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) tried to reason with me and
show me the way. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not resent my conduct, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) simply said that
some day I should receive the first-fruits of the Spirit--that those
who came to scoff sometimes remained to pray. There was a strange
magic in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) words. They sank into my mind. But the loss of my
mother hit me most; and by degrees I was brought to see daylight.
Since then my one desire has been to hand on the true view to others,
and that is what I was trying to do to-day; though it is only lately
that I have preached hereabout. The first months of my ministry have
been spent in the North of England among strangers, where I preferred
to make my earliest clumsy attempts, so as to acquire courage before
undergoing that severest of all tests of one's sincerity, addressing
those who have known one, and have been one's companions in the days
of darkness. If you could only know, Tess, the pleasure of having a
good slap at yourself, I am sure--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go on with it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried passionately, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) to a stile by the wayside, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bent herself. <div class="bookquote">``I
can't believe in such sudden things! I feel indignant with you for
talking to me like this, when you know--when you know what harm
you've done me! You, and those like you, take your fill of pleasure
on earth by making the life of such as me bitter and black with
sorrow; and then it is a fine thing, when you have had enough of
that, to think of securing your pleasure in heaven by becoming
converted! Out upon such--I don't believe in you--I hate it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) insisted; <div class="bookquote">``don't speak so! It came to me like a jolly new
idea! And you don't believe me? What don't you believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your conversion. Your scheme of religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Because a better man than you does not
believe in such.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a woman's reason! Who is this better man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) declared, a resentment beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) words seeming ready to
spring out at a moment's notice, <div class="bookquote">``God forbid that I should say I am
a good man--and you know I don't say any such thing. I am new to
goodness, truly; but newcomers see furthest sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) replied sadly. <div class="bookquote">``But I cannot believe in your conversion
to a new spirit. Such flashes as you feel, Alec, I fear don't last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned from the stile over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been
leaning, and faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>); whereupon his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) eyes, falling casually upon
the familiar countenance and form, remained contemplating her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). The
inferior man was quiet in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now; but it was surely not extracted,
nor even entirely subdued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't look at me like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said abruptly.

<p/>Tess, who had been quite unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) action and mien,
instantly withdrew the large dark gaze of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes, stammering with
a flush, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>And there was revived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) the
wretched sentiment which had often come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) before, that in
inhabiting the fleshly tabernacle with which Nature had endowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was somehow doing wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! Don't beg my pardon. But since you wear a veil to hide
your good looks, why don't you keep it down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pulled down the veil, saying hastily, <div class="bookquote">``It was mostly to keep off
the wind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may seem harsh of me to dictate like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``but
it is better that I should not look too often on you. It might be
dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ssh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, women's faces have had too much power over me already for me
not to fear them! An evangelist has nothing to do with such as they;
and it reminds me of the old times that I would forget!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>After this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and
then as they rambled onward, Tess inwardly wondering how far he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and not liking to send him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back by positive mandate.
Frequently when they came to a gate or stile they found painted
thereon in red or blue letters some text of Scripture, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew who had been at the pains to blazon these
announcements. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that the man was employed by himself and
others who were working with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in that district, to paint these
reminders that no means might be left untried which might move the
hearts of a wicked generation.

<p/>At length the road touched the spot called <div class="bookquote">``Cross-in-Hand.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Of all
spots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn.
It was so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by
artists and view-lovers as to reach a new kind of beauty, a negative
beauty of tragic tone. The place took its name from a stone pillar
which stood there, a strange rude monolith, from a stratum unknown
in any local quarry, on which was roughly carved a human hand.
Differing accounts were given of its history and purport. Some
authorities stated that a devotional cross had once formed the
complete erection thereon, of which the present relic was but the
stump; others that the stone as it stood was entire, and that it had
been fixed there to mark a boundary or place of meeting. Anyhow,
whatever the origin of the relic, there was and is something
sinister, or solemn, according to mood, in the scene amid which it
stands; something tending to impress the most phlegmatic passer-by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I must leave you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) remarked, as they drew near to
this spot. <div class="bookquote">``I have to preach at Abbot's-Cernel at six this evening,
and my way lies across to the right from here. And you upset me
somewhat too, Tessy--I cannot, will not, say why. I must go away and
get strength. ... How is it that you speak so fluently now? Who has
taught you such good English?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have learnt things in my troubles,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) said evasively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What troubles have you had?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) of the first one--the only one that related to him (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>).

<p/>D``Urberville was struck mute. ``I knew nothing of this till now!''
he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) next murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you write to me when you felt your
trouble coming on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) did not reply; and he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) broke the silence by adding: <div class="bookquote">``Well--you
will see me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Do not again come near me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will think. But before we part come here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) stepped up to the
pillar. <div class="bookquote">``This was once a Holy Cross. Relics are not in my creed; but
I fear you at moments--far more than you need fear me at present; and
to lessen my fear, put your hand upon that stone hand, and swear that
you will never tempt me--by your charms or ways.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God--how can you ask what is so unnecessary! All that is
furthest from my thought!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--but swear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess, half frightened, gave way to his (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) importunity; placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand
upon the stone and swore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you are not a believer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``that some
unbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind. But
no more now. At home at least I can pray for you; and I will; and
who knows what may not happen? I'm off. Goodbye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) turned to a hunting-gate in the hedge and, without letting his (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>)
eyes again rest upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), leapt over and struck out across the down
in the direction of Abbot's-Cernel. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) walked his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) pace showed
perturbation, and by-and-by, as if instigated by a former thought,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) pocket a small book, between the leaves of which
was folded a letter, worn and soiled, as from much re-reading.
D``Urberville opened the letter. It was dated several months before
this time, and was signed by Parson Clare.

<p/>The letter began by expressing the writer's unfeigned joy at
d``Urberville's conversion, and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) kindness in
communicating with the parson on the subject. It expressed Mr
Clare's warm assurance of forgiveness for d``Urberville's former
conduct and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) interest in the young man's plans for the future.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), Mr Clare, would much have liked to see d``Urberville in the Church
to whose ministry he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had devoted so many years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own life, and
would have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to enter a theological college to that end; but
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) correspondent had possibly not cared to do this on account
of the delay it would have entailed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was not the man to insist
upon its paramount importance. Every man must work as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could best
work, and in the method towards which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt impelled by the Spirit.

<p/>D``Urberville read and re-read this letter, and seemed to quiz himself
cynically. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also read some passages from memoranda as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked
till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face assumed a calm, and apparently the image of Tess no
longer troubled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
nearest way home. Within the distance of a mile she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) met a solitary
shepherd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Was it ever a Holy Cross?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Cross--no; `twer not a cross! <div class="bookquote">``Tis a thing of ill-omen, Miss.. It
was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was
tortured there by nailing his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) hand to a post and afterwards hung.
The bones lie underneath. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) sold his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) soul to the devil,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) walks at times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt the _petite mort_ at this unexpectedly gruesome information,
and left the solitary man behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). It was dusk when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) drew near
to Flintcomb-Ash, and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
approached a girl and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lover without their observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). They
were talking no secrets, and the clear unconcerned voice of the young
woman, in response to the warmer accents of the man, spread into the
chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon, full
of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded. For a
moment the voices cheered the heart of Tess, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reasoned that
this interview had its origin, on one side or the other, in the same
attraction which had been the prelude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own tribulation. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came close, the girl turned serenely and recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), the
young man walking off in embarrassment. The woman was Izz Huett,
whose interest in Tess's excursion immediately superseded her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own
proceedings. Tess did not explain very clearly its results, and Izz,
who was a girl of tact, began to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own little affair, a
phase of which Tess had just witnessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) is Amby Seedling, the chap who used to sometimes come and help at
Talbothays,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) explained indifferently. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) actually inquired and
found out that I had come here, and has followed me. He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)'s
been in love wi' me these two years. But I've hardly answered him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>).''



 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>XLVI


<p/>Several days had passed since her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) futile journey, and Tess was
afield. The dry winter wind still blew, but a screen of thatched
hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).
On the sheltered side was a turnip-slicing machine, whose bright blue
hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene.
Opposite its front was a long mound or <div class="bookquote">``grave'' (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>, in which the roots
had been preserved since early winter. Tess was standing at the
uncovered end, chopping off with a bill-hook the fibres and earth
from each root, and throwing it after the operation into the slicer.
A man was turning the handle of the machine, and from its trough
came the newly-cut swedes, the fresh smell of whose yellow chips
was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind, the smart swish
of the slicing-blades, and the choppings of the hook in Tess's
leather-gloved hand.

<p/>The wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness, apparent where
the swedes had been pulled, was beginning to be striped in wales of
darker brown, gradually broadening to ribands. Along the edge of
each of these something crept upon ten legs, moving without haste
and without rest up and down the whole length of the field; it was
two horses and a man, the plough going between them, turning up the
cleared ground for a spring sowing.

<p/>For hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things. Then, far
beyond the ploughing-teams, a black speck was seen. It had come from
the corner of a fence, where there was a gap, and its tendency was
up the incline, towards the swede-cutters. From the proportions of
a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin, and was soon
perceived to be a man in black, arriving from the direction of
Flintcomb-Ash. The man at the slicer, having nothing else to do with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, continually observed the comer, but Tess, who was occupied,
did not perceive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) till her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) companion directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
approach.

<p/>It was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hard taskmaster, Farmer Groby; it was one in a
semi-clerical costume, who now represented what had once been the
free-and-easy Alec d``Urberville. Not being hot at his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) preaching
there was less enthusiasm about him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) now, and the presence of the
grinder seemed to embarrass him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>). A pale distress was already on
Tess's face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) curtained hood further over it.

<p/>D``Urberville came up and said quietly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to you, Tess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have refused my last request, not to come near me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I have a good reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, tell it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is more serious than you may think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) glanced round to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) were overheard. They were at some
distance from the man who turned the slicer, and the movement of the
machine, too, sufficiently prevented Alec's words reaching other
ears. D``Urberville placed himself so as to screen Tess from the
labourer, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) back to the latter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) continued, with capricious compunction. <div class="bookquote">``In
thinking of your soul and mine when we last met, I neglected to
inquire as to your worldly condition. You were well dressed, and I
did not think of it. But I see now that it is hard--harder than it
used to be when I--knew you--harder than you deserve. Perhaps a good
deal of it is owning to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) inquiringly, as, with bent
head, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face completely screened by the hood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
trimming of the swedes. By going on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) work she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt better
able to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) emotions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) added, with a sigh of discontent,--<div class="bookquote">``yours was the very
worst case I ever was concerned in! I had no idea of what had
resulted till you told me. Scamp that I was to foul that innocent
life! The whole blame was mine--the whole unconventional business
of our time at Trantridge. You, too, the real blood of which I am
but the base imitation, what a blind young thing you were as to
possibilities! I say in all earnestness that it is a shame for
parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the
gins and nets that the wicked may set for them, whether their motive
be a good one or the result of simple indifference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess still did no more than listen, throwing down one globular root
and taking up another with automatic regularity, the pensive contour
of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is not that I came to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>d``Urberville went on. <div class="bookquote">``My
circumstances are these. I have lost my mother since you were at
Trantridge, and the place is my own. But I intend to sell it, and
devote myself to missionary work in Africa. A devil of a poor hand
I shall make at the trade, no doubt. However, what I want to ask
you is, will you put it in my power to do my duty--to make the only
reparation I can make for the trick played you: that is, will you be
my wife, and go with me? ... I have already obtained this precious
document. It was my old mother's dying wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) drew a piece of parchment from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) pocket, with a slight fumbling
of embarrassment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A marriage licence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, sir--no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said quickly, starting back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not? Why is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely
the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d``Urberville's face. It
was unmistakably a symptom that something of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) old passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had been revived; duty and desire ran hand-in-hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) began again, in more impetuous tones, and then looked
round at the labourer who turned the slicer.

<p/>Tess, too, felt that the argument could not be ended there.
Informing the man that a gentleman had come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
wished to walk a little way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) moved off with d``Urberville across
the zebra-striped field. When they reached the first newly-ploughed
section he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand to help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) over it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stepped
forward on the summits of the earth-rolls as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not marry me, Tess, and make me a self-respecting man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
repeated, as soon as they were over the furrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I have no affection for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you would get to feel that in time, perhaps--as soon as you
really could forgive me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so positive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love somebody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The words seemed to astonish him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Somebody else? But has not a sense of what is
morally right and proper any weight with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no--don't say that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyhow, then, your love for this other man may be only a passing
feeling which you will overcome--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes! Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must in honour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then ... I have married him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) exclaimed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stopped dead and gazed at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not wish to tell--I did not mean to!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``It is a
secret here, or at any rate but dimly known. So will you, PLEASE
will you, keep from questioning me? You must remember that we are
now strangers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strangers--are we? Strangers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment a flash of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) old irony marked his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face; but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
determinedly chastened it down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that man your husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked mechanically, denoting by a sign
the labourer who turned the machine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That man!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said proudly. <div class="bookquote">``I should think not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not ask what I do not wish to tell!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) begged, and flashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) upturned face and lash-shadowed eyes.

<p/>D``Urberville was disturbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I only asked for your sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) retorted hotly. ``Angels of
heaven!--God forgive me for such an expression--I came here, I swear,
as I thought for your good. Tess--don't look at me so--I cannot
stand your looks! There never were such eyes, surely, before
Christianity or since! There--I won't lose my head; I dare not.
I own that the sight of you had waked up my love for you, which, I
believed, was extinguished with all such feelings. But I thought
that our marriage might be a sanctification for us both. ``The
unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving
wife is sanctified by the husband,<div class="bookquote">'' I said to myself. But my plan
is dashed from me; and I must bear the disappointment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) moodily reflected with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes on the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Married. Married! ... Well, that being so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added, quite
calmly, tearing the licence slowly into halves and putting them in
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket; <div class="bookquote">``that being prevented, I should like to do some good to
you and your husband, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may be. There are many questions
that I am tempted to ask, but I will not do so, of course, in
opposition to your wishes. Though, if I could know your husband, I
might more easily benefit him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and you. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on this farm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is far away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Far away? From YOU? What sort of husband can he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, do not speak against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! It was through you! He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found out--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, is it so! ... That's sad, Tess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to stay away from you--to leave you to work like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not leave me to work!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried, springing to the defence
of the absent one with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fervour. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) don't know it! It is by
my own arrangement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, does he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) write?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I cannot tell you. There are things which are private to
ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course that means that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not. You are a deserted wife, my
fair Tess--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In an impulse he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned suddenly to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand; the buff-glove was
on it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seized only the rough leather fingers which did not
express the life or shape of those within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not--you must not!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried fearfully, slipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand
from the glove as from a pocket, and leaving it in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grasp. <div class="bookquote">``O,
will you go away--for the sake of me and my husband--go, in the name
of your own Christianity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said abruptly, and thrusting the glove back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned to leave. Facing round, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Tess, as
God is my judge, I meant no humbug in taking your hand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field, which they had not
noticed in their preoccupation, ceased close behind them; and a voice
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ear:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o'
day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Farmer Groby had espied the two figures from the distance, and had
inquisitively ridden across, to learn what was their business in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>)
field.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak like that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said d``Urberville, his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) face
blackening with something that was not Christianity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Mister! And what mid Methodist pa`sons have to do with
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is the fellow?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked d``Urberville, turning to Tess.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went close up to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go--I do beg you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! And leave you to that tyrant? I can see in his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) face what a
churl he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) won't hurt me. HE (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>)<div class="bookquote">``S not in love with me. I can leave at
Lady-Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have no right but to obey, I suppose. But--well, goodbye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>defender sort</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) defender, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dreaded more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) assailant, having
reluctantly disappeared, the farmer continued his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) reprimand, which
Tess took with the greatest coolness, that sort of attack being
independent of sex. To have as a master this man of stone, who would
have cuffed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had dared, was almost a relief after her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) former
experiences. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) silently walked back towards the summit of the
field that was the scene of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) labour, so absorbed in the interview
which had just taken place that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was hardly aware that the nose of
Groby's horse almost touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If so be you make an agreement to work for me till Lady-Day, I'll
see that you carry it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) growled. <div class="bookquote">''`Od rot the women--now

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Knowing very well that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not harass the other women of the
farm as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) harassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) out of spite for the flooring he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once
received, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did for one moment picture what might have been the
result if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been free to accept the offer just made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) of
being the monied Alec's wife. It would have lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) completely
out of subjection, not only to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) present oppressive employer, but
to a whole world who seemed to despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said
breathlessly; <div class="bookquote">``I could not have married him (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) now! He (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) is so unpleasant
to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>That very night she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) began an appealing letter to Clare, concealing
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hardships, and assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) undying affection.
Any one who had been in a position to read between the lines would
have seen that at the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) great love was some monstrous
fear--almost a desperation--as to some secret contingencies which
were not disclosed. But again she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) effusion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
had asked Izz to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at
all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) put the letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) box, and wondered if it would ever
reach Angel's hands.

<p/>After this her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) daily tasks were gone through heavily enough, and
brought on the day which was of great import to agriculturists--the
day of the Candlemas Fair. It was at this fair that new engagements
were entered into for the twelve months following the ensuing
Lady-Day, and those of the farming population who thought of changing
their places duly attended at the county-town where the fair was
held. Nearly all the labourers on Flintcomb-Ash farm intended
flight, and early in the morning there was a general exodus in the
direction of the town, which lay at a distance of from ten to a dozen
miles over hilly country. Though Tess also meant to leave at the
quarter-day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was one of the few who did not go to the fair,
having a vaguely-shaped hope that something would happen to render
another outdoor engagement unnecessary.

<p/>It was a peaceful February day, of wonderful softness for the time,
and one would almost have thought that winter was over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
hardly finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dinner when d``Urberville's figure darkened the
window of the cottage wherein she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was a lodger, which she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had all to
herself to-day.

<p/>Tess jumped up, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) visitor had knocked at the door, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
could hardly in reason run away. D``Urberville's knock, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) walk up
to the door, had some indescribable quality of difference from his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
air when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) last saw him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>). They seemed to be acts of which the doer
was ashamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would not open the door; but, as
there was no sense in that either, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arose, and having lifted the
latch stepped back quickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) came in, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and flung himself
down into a chair before speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess--I couldn't help it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) began desperately, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
heated face, which had also a superimposed flush of excitement. <div class="bookquote">``I
felt that I must call at least to ask how you are. I assure you I
had not been thinking of you at all till I saw you that Sunday; now I
cannot get rid of your image, try how I may! It is hard that a good
woman should do harm to a bad man; yet so it is. If you would only
pray for me, Tess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The suppressed discontent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) manner was almost pitiable, and yet
Tess did not pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I pray for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when I am forbidden to believe
that the great Power who moves the world would alter His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plans on my
account?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You really think that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cured? By whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By my husband, if I must tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--your husband--your husband! How strange it seems! I remember
you hinted something of the sort the other day. What do you really
believe in these matters, Tess?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``You seem to have no
religion--perhaps owing to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have. Though I don't believe in anything supernatural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>D``Urberville looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with misgiving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then do you think that the line I take is all wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good deal of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm--and yet I've felt so sure about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe in the SPIRIT of the Sermon on the Mount, and so did my
dear husband... But I don't believe--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) negations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said d``Urberville drily, <div class="bookquote">``whatever your dear husband
believed you accept, and whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rejected you reject, without the
least inquiry or reasoning on your own part. That's just like you
women. Your mind is enslaved to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), with a triumphant
simplicity of faith in Angel Clare that the most perfect man could
hardly have deserved, much less her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from
another person like that. A pretty fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) must be to teach you
such scepticism!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never forced my judgement! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would never argue on the subject
with me! But I looked at it in this way; what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) believed, after
inquiring deep into doctrines, was much more likely to be right than
what I might believe, who hadn't looked into doctrines at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What used he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to say? He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) must have said something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reflected; and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) acute memory for the letter of Angel
Clare's remarks, even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not comprehend their spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
recalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
use when, as it occasionally happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) indulged in a species of
thinking aloud with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) side. In delivering it she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gave also
Clare's accent and manner with reverential faithfulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say that again,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>asked d``Urberville, who had listened with the
greatest attention.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) repeated the argument, and d``Urberville thoughtfully murmured the
words after her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) presently asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said at another time something like this'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) gave another,
which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the
pedigree ranging from the _Dictionnaire Philosophique_ to Huxley's
_Essays_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--ha! How do you remember them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to believe what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) believed, though he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) didn't wish me to;
and I managed to coax him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to tell me a few of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thoughts. I can't
say I quite understand that one; but I know it is right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm. Fancy your being able to teach me what you don't know
yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) fell into thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I threw in my spiritual lot with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) resumed. <div class="bookquote">``I
didn't wish it to be different. What's good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is good
enough for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) know that you are as big an infidel as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I never told him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)--if I am an infidel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--you are better off to-day that I am, Tess, after all! You
don't believe that you ought to preach my doctrine, and, therefore,
do no despite to your conscience in abstaining. I do believe I ought
to preach it, but, like the devils, I believe and tremble, for I
suddenly leave off preaching it, and give way to my passion for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) said aridly; <div class="bookquote">``I have come all the way here to see you
to-day! But I started from home to go to Casterbridge Fair, where
I have undertaken to preach the Word from a waggon at half-past two
this afternoon, and where all the brethren are expecting me this
minute. Here's the announcement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) breast-pocket a poster whereon was printed the day,
hour, and place of meeting, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>), d``Urberville, would preach
the Gospel as aforesaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can you get there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, looking at the clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot get there! I have come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, you have really arranged to preach, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have arranged to preach, and I shall not be there--by reason of my
burning desire to see a woman whom I once despised!--No, by my word
and truth, I never despised you; if I had I should not love you now!
Why I did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in
spite of all; you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely
when you saw the situation; you did not remain at my pleasure; so
there was one petticoat in the world for whom I had no contempt,
and you are she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But you may well despise me now! I thought I
worshipped on the mountains, but I find I still serve in the groves!
Ha! ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``O Alec d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville! what does this mean? What have I done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) said, with a soulless sneer in the word. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing
intentionally. But you have been the means--the innocent means--of
my backsliding, as they call it. I ask myself, am I, indeed, one of
those `servants of corruption' who, `after they have escaped the

whose latter end is worse than their beginning?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) hand on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Tess, my girl, I was on the way to, at least, social
salvation till I saw you again!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) said freakishly shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) were a child. <div class="bookquote">``And why then have you tempted me? I was firm
as a man could be till I saw those eyes and that mouth again--surely
there never was such a maddening mouth since Eve's!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) voice sank,
and a hot archness shot from his (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) own black eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You temptress,
Tess; you dear damned witch of Babylon--I could not resist you as
soon as I met you again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help your seeing me again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess, recoiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it--I repeat that I do not blame you. But the fact remains.
When I saw you ill-used on the farm that day I was nearly mad to
think that I had no legal right to protect you--that I could not have
it; whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) who has it seems to neglect you utterly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak against him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is absent!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried in much
excitement. <div class="bookquote">``Treat him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) honourably--he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has never wronged you! O
leave his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife before any scandal spreads that may do harm to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
honest name!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will--I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) said, like a man awakening from a luring dream.
<div class="bookquote">``I have broken my engagement to preach to those poor drunken boobies
at the fair--it is the first time I have played such a practical
joke. A month ago I should have been horrified at such a
possibility. I'll go away--to swear--and--ah, can I! to keep away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then, suddenly: <div class="bookquote">``One clasp, Tessy--one! Only for old friendship--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am without defence. Alec! A good man's honour is in my keeping--
think--be ashamed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! Well, yes--yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) lips, mortified with himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) weakness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>)
eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith. The corpses
of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) face ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) reformation seemed to wake and come
together as in a resurrection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Huxley</b></font>) went out indeterminately.

<p/>Though d``Urberville had declared that this breach of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) engagement
to-day was the simple backsliding of a believer, Tess's words, as
echoed from Angel Clare, had made a deep impression upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and
continued to do so after he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) moved on in silence, as
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt-of possibility
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) position was untenable. Reason had had nothing to do with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a
careless man in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed
by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's death.

<p/>The drops of logic Tess had let fall into the sea of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enthusiasm
served to chill its effervescence to stagnation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pondered again and again over the crystallized phrases that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had handed on to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``That clever fellow little thought that, by
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) those things, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be paving my way back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)!''



 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>XLVII


<p/>It is the threshing of the last wheat-rick at Flintcomb-Ash farm. The
dawn of the March morning is singularly inexpressive, and there is
nothing to show where the eastern horizon lies. Against the twilight
rises the trapezoidal top of the stack, which has stood forlornly
here through the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather.

<p/>When Izz Huett and Tess arrived at the scene of operations only a
rustling denoted that others had preceded them; to which, as the
light increased, there were presently added the silhouettes of two
men on the summit. They were busily <div class="bookquote">``unhaling''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>the rick, that
is, stripping off the thatch before beginning to throw down the
sheaves; and while this was in progress Izz and Tess, with the
other women-workers, in their whitey-brown pinners, stood waiting
and shivering, Farmer Groby having insisted upon their being on
the spot thus early to get the job over if possible by the end of
the day. Close under the eaves of the stack, and as yet barely
visible, was the red tyrant that the women had come to serve--a
timber-framed construction, with straps and wheels appertaining--
the threshing-machine which, whilst it was going, kept up a
despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves.

<p/>A little way off there was another indistinct figure; this one black,
with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve.
The long chimney running up beside an ash-tree, and the warmth which
radiated from the spot, explained without the necessity of much
daylight that here was the engine which was to act as the _primum
mobile_ of this little world. By the engine stood a dark, motionless
being, a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness, in a sort of trance,
with a heap of coals by his side: it was the engine-man. The
isolation of his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) manner and colour lent him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) the appearance of a
creature from Tophet, who had strayed into the pellucid smokelessness
of this region of yellow grain and pale soil, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) had
nothing in common, to amaze and to discompose its aborigines.

<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) looked he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) felt. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) was in the agricultural world, but not of
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) served fire and smoke; these denizens of the fields served
vegetation, weather, frost, and sun. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) travelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) engine
from farm to farm, from county to county, for as yet the steam
threshing-machine was itinerant in this part of Wessex. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) spoke in
a strange northern accent; his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) thoughts being turned inwards upon
himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) eye on his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) iron charge, hardly perceiving the scenes
around him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>), and caring for them not at all: holding only strictly
necessary intercourse with the natives, as if some ancient doom
compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) to wander here against his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) will in the service of his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)
Plutonic master. The long strap which ran from the driving-wheel of
his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) engine to the red thresher under the rick was the sole tie-line
between agriculture and him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>).

<p/>While they uncovered the sheaves he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) stood apathetic beside his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)
portable repository of force, round whose hot blackness the morning
air quivered. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) had nothing to do with preparatory labour. His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)
fire was waiting incandescent, his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) steam was at high pressure, in
a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) could make the long strap move at an invisible
velocity. Beyond its extent the environment might be corn, straw,
or chaos; it was all the same to him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>). If any of the autochthonous
idlers asked him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) called himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) replied shortly, <div class="bookquote">``an
engineer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The rick was unhaled by full daylight; the men then took their
places, the women mounted, and the work began. Farmer Groby--or, as
they called him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--had arrived ere this, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) orders Tess
was placed on the platform of the machine, close to the man who fed
it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) business being to untie every sheaf of corn handed on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
by Izz Huett, who stood next, but on the rick; so that the feeder
could seize it and spread it over the revolving drum, which whisked
out every grain in one moment.

<p/>They were soon in full progress, after a preparatory hitch or two,
which rejoiced the hearts of those who hated machinery. The work
sped on till breakfast time, when the thresher was stopped for half
an hour; and on starting again after the meal the whole supplementary
strength of the farm was thrown into the labour of constructing the
straw-rick, which began to grow beside the stack of corn. A hasty
lunch was eaten as they stood, without leaving their positions, and
then another couple of hours brought them near to dinner-time; the
inexorable wheel continuing to spin, and the penetrating hum of the
thresher to thrill to the very marrow all who were near the revolving
wire-cage.

<p/>The old men on the rising straw-rick talked of the past days
when they had been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken
barn-floor; when everything, even to winnowing, was effected by
hand-labour, which, to their thinking, though slow, produced better
results. Those, too, on the corn-rick talked a little; but the
perspiring ones at the machine, including Tess, could not lighten
their duties by the exchange of many words. It was the ceaselessness
of the work which tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) so severely, and began to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had never some to Flintcomb-Ash. The women on the
corn-rick--Marian, who was one of them, in particular--could stop to
drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now and then, or to exchange
a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their faces or cleared the
fragments of straw and husk from their clothing; but for Tess there
was no respite; for, as the drum never stopped, the man who fed
it could not stop, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), who had to supply the man with untied
sheaves, could not stop either, unless Marian changed places with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>), which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby's
objections that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) was too slow-handed for a feeder.

<p/>For some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was
chosen for this particular duty, and Groby gave as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) motive in
selecting Tess that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was one of those who best combined strength
with quickness in untying, and both with staying power, and this may
have been true. The hum of the thresher, which prevented speech,
increased to a raving whenever the supply of corn fell short of the
regular quantity. As Tess and the man who fed could never turn their
heads she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not know that just before the dinner-hour a person had
come silently into the field by the gate, and had been standing under
a second rick watching the scene and Tess in particular. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
dressed in a tweed suit of fashionable pattern, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) twirled a gay
walking-cane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz Huett to Marian. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) had at first addressed
the inquiry to Tess, but the latter could not hear it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Somebody's fancy-man, I s`pose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian laconically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll lay a guinea he (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>)'s after Tess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``O no. <div class="bookquote">``Tis a ranter pa`son who's been sniffing after her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lately;
not a dandy like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--this is the same man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same man as the preacher? But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s quite different!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``D'ye really think so? Then I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said Marian.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't think it at all right for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to join his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preaching to
courting a married woman, even though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband mid be abroad, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in a sense, a widow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can do her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>said Izz drily. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind can no more

preaching, nor the seven thunders themselves, can wean a woman when
`twould be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should be weaned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Dinner-time came, and the whirling ceased; whereupon Tess left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
post, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knees trembling so wretchedly with the shaking of the
machine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could scarcely walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to het a quart o' drink into `ee, as I've done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div>said
Marian. <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't look so white then. Why, souls above us,
your face is as if you'd been hagrode!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marian</b></font>)</div><p/>It occurred to the good-natured Marian that, as Tess was so tired,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) discovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) visitor's presence might have the bad effect of
taking away her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) appetite; and Marian was thinking of inducing Tess
to descend by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the
gentleman came forward and looked up.

<p/>Tess uttered a short little <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>And a moment after she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said,
quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I shall eat my dinner here--right on the rick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did
this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and
the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack.

<p/>The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d``Urberville, the late Evangelist,
despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance
that the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Evangelist</b></font>) had restored
himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four
years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess
had first known her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) admirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided
to remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of
sight of the ground, and began her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) meal; till, by-and-by, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) heard
footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the
stack--now an oblong and level platform of sheaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) strode across
them, and sat down opposite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) without a word.

<p/>Tess continued to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) modest dinner, a slice of thick pancake
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). The other workfolk were by this
time all gathered under the rick, where the loose straw formed a
comfortable retreat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am here again, as you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said d``Urberville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you trouble me so!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) cried, reproach flashing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)
very finger-ends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trouble YOU? I think I may ask, why do you trouble me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, I don't trouble you any-when!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say you don't? But you do! You haunt me. Those very eyes that
you turned upon me with such a bitter flash a moment ago, they come
to me just as you showed them then, in the night and in the day!
Tess, ever since you told me of that child of ours, it is just as if
my feelings, which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream,
had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you, and had all at
once gushed through. The religious channel is left dry forthwith;
and it is you who have done it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) gazed in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--you have given up your preaching entirely?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)
had gathered from Angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern
thought to despise flash enthusiasm; but, as a woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
somewhat appalled.

<p/>In affected severity d``Urberville continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Entirely. I have broken every engagement since that afternoon I was
to address the drunkards at Casterbridge Fair. The deuce only knows
what I am thought of by the brethren. Ah-ha! The brethren! No
doubt they pray for me--weep for me; for they are kind people in
their way. But what do I care? How could I go on with the thing
when I had lost my faith in it?--it would have been hypocrisy of
the basest kind! Among them I should have stood like Hymenaeus and
Alexander, who were delivered over to Satan that they might learn
not to blaspheme. What a grand revenge you have taken! I saw you
innocent, and I deceived you. Four years after, you find me a
Christian enthusiast; you then work upon me, perhaps to my complete
perdition! But Tess, my coz, as I used to call you, this is only
my way of talking, and you must not look so horribly concerned.
Of course you have done nothing except retain your pretty face and
shapely figure. I saw it on the rick before you saw me--that tight
pinafore-thing sets it off, and that wing-bonnet--you field-girls
should never wear those bonnets if you wish to keep out of danger.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) silently for a few moments, and with a short cynical
laugh resumed: <div class="bookquote">``I believe that if the bachelor-apostle, whose deputy
I thought I was, had been tempted by such a pretty face, he (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) would
have let go the plough for her (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) sake as I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess attempted to expostulate, but at this juncture all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fluency
failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and without heeding he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other,
after all. But to speak seriously, Tess.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>D``Urberville rose and
came nearer, reclining sideways amid the sheaves, and resting upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) elbow. <div class="bookquote">``Since I last saw you, I have been thinking of what
you said that HE (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) said. I have come to the conclusion that there
does seem rather a want of common-sense in these threadbare old
propositions; how I could have been so fired by poor Parson Clare's
enthusiasm, and have gone so madly to work, transcending even him (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>), I
cannot make out! As for what you said last time, on the strength of
your wonderful husband's intelligence--whose name you have never told
me--about having what they call an ethical system without any dogma,
I don't see my way to that at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you can have the religion of loving-kindness and purity at
least, if you can't have--what do you call it--dogma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``O no! I'm a different sort of fellow from that! If there's nobody
to say, ``Do this, and it will be a good thing for you after you are
dead; do that, and if will be a bad thing for you,<div class="bookquote">'' I can't warm up.
Hang it, I am not going to feel responsible for my deeds and passions
if there's nobody to be responsible to; and if I were you, my dear,
I wouldn't either!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tried to argue, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had mixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) dull
brain two matters, theology and morals, which in the primitive days
of mankind had been quite distinct. But owing to Angel Clare's
reticence, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) absolute want of training, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) being a
vessel of emotions rather than reasons, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not get on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) resumed. <div class="bookquote">``Here I am, my love, as in the old
times!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as then--never as then--`tis different!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) entreated. <div class="bookquote">``And
there was never warmth with me! O why didn't you keep your faith,
if the loss of it has brought you to speak to me like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you've knocked it out of me; so the evil be upon your sweet
head! Your husband little thought how his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) teaching would recoil upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! Ha-ha--I'm awfully glad you have made an apostate of me all the
same! Tess, I am more taken with you than ever, and I pity you too.
For all your closeness, I see you are in a bad way--neglected by one
who ought to cherish you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not get her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) morsels of food down her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) throat; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips
were dry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was ready to choke. The voices and laughs of the
workfolk eating and drinking under the rick came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as if they
were a quarter of a mile off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is cruelty to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``How--how can you treat me to this
talk, if you care ever so little for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, wincing a little. ``I did not come to reproach
you for my deeds. I came Tess, to say that I don't like you to be
working like this, and I have come on purpose for you. You say you
have a husband who is not I. Well, perhaps you have; but I've never
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and you've not told me his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) name; and altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seems
rather a mythological personage. However, even if you have one, I
think I am nearer to you than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is. I, at any rate, try to help you
out of trouble, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not, bless his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) invisible face! The words
of the stern prophet Hosea that I used to read come back to me.
Don't you know them, Tess?--``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shall follow after her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lover,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shall not overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shall seek him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), but shall
not find him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>); then shall she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) say, I will go and return to my first
husband; for then was it better with me than now!<div class="bookquote">'' ... Tess, my trap
is waiting just under the hill, and--darling mine, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)!--you know
the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face had been rising to a dull crimson fire while he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) spoke; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been the cause of my backsliding,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) continued, stretching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) waist; <div class="bookquote">``you should be willing to share it, and
leave that mule you call husband for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) leather gloves, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had taken off to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
skimmer-cake, lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lap, and without the slightest warning she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
passionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) face.
It was heavy and thick as a warrior's, and it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) flat on the
mouth. Fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of
a trick in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) armed progenitors were not unpractised. Alec
fiercely started up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) reclining position. A scarlet oozing
appeared where her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) blow had alighted, and in a moment the blood began
dropping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) mouth upon the straw. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) soon controlled
himself, calmly drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) handkerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) pocket, and mopped
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) bleeding lips.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) too had sprung up, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sank down again. <div class="bookquote">``Now, punish me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
said, turning up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) with the hopeless defiance of the
sparrow's gaze before its captor twists its neck. <div class="bookquote">``Whip me, crush
me; you need not mind those people under the rick! I shall not cry
out. Once victim, always victim--that's the law!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, no, Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captor</b></font>) said blandly. <div class="bookquote">``I can make full allowance for
this. Yet you most unjustly forget one thing, that I would have
married you if you had not put it out of my power to do so. Did I
not ask you flatly to be my wife--hey? Answer me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you cannot be. But remember one thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>captor</b></font>) voice hardened
as his (<font color='blue'><b>captor</b></font>) temper got the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>captor</b></font>) with the recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>captor</b></font>)
sincerity in asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) present ingratitude, and he (<font color='blue'><b>captor</b></font>) stepped
across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) side and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) by the shoulders, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shook
under his (<font color='blue'><b>captor</b></font>) grasp. <div class="bookquote">``Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will
be your master again. If you are any man's wife you are mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The threshers now began to stir below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much for our quarrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captor</b></font>) said, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) go. <div class="bookquote">``Now I shall
leave you, and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon.
You don't know me yet! But I know you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not spoken again, remaining as if stunned. D``Urberville
retreated over the sheaves, and descended the ladder, while the
workers below rose and stretched their arms, and shook down the beer
they had drunk. Then the threshing-machine started afresh; and amid
the renewed rustle of the straw Tess resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) position by the
buzzing drum as one in a dream, untying sheaf after sheaf in endless
succession.



<p/>XLVIII


<p/>In the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be
finished that night, since there was a moon by which they could see
to work, and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on
the morrow. Hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded
with even less intermission than usual.

<p/>It was not till <div class="bookquote">``nammet'' (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>-time, about three o-clock, that Tess raised
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes and gave a momentary glance round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt but little
surprise at seeing that Alec d``Urberville had come back, and was
standing under the hedge by the gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lift her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eyes, and waved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand urbanely to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blew her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a kiss.
It meant that their quarrel was over. Tess looked down again, and
carefully abstained from gazing in that direction.

<p/>Thus the afternoon dragged on. The wheat-rick shrank lower, and the
straw-rick grew higher, and the corn-sacks were carted away. At six
o'clock the wheat-rick was about shoulder-high from the ground. But
the unthreshed sheaves remaining untouched seemed countless still,
notwithstanding the enormous numbers that had been gulped down by
the insatiable swallower, fed by the man and Tess, through whose two
young hands the greater part of them had passed. And the immense
stack of straw where in the morning there had been nothing, appeared
as the faeces of the same buzzing red glutton. From the west sky
a wrathful shine--all that wild March could afford in the way of
sunset--had burst forth after the cloudy day, flooding the tired and
sticky faces of the threshers, and dyeing them with a coppery light,
as also the flapping garments of the women, which clung to them like
dull flames.

<p/>A panting ache ran through the rick. The man who fed was weary, and
Tess could see that the red nape of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck was encrusted with dirt
and husks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) still stood at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) post, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) flushed and perspiring
face coated with the corndust, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) white bonnet embrowned by it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was the only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be
shaken bodily by its spinning, and the decrease of the stack now
separated her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from Marian and Izz, and prevented their changing
duties with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as they had done. The incessant quivering, in
which every fibre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) frame participated, had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) into a
stupefied reverie in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arms worked on independently of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
consciousness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hardly knew where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, and did not hear Izz
Huett tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from below that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hair was tumbling down.

<p/>By degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and
saucer-eyed. Whenever Tess lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) beheld always the
great upgrown straw-stack, with the men in shirt-sleeves upon it,
against the gray north sky; in front of it the long red elevator
like a Jacob's ladder, on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw
ascended, a yellow river running uphill, and spouting out on the top
of the rick.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew that Alec d``Urberville was still on the scene, observing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) from some point or other, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not say where. There
was an excuse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) remaining, for when the threshed rick drew
near its final sheaves a little ratting was always done, and men
unconnected with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that
performance--sporting characters of all descriptions, gents with
terriers and facetious pipes, roughs with sticks and stones.

<p/>But there was another hour's work before the layer of live rats at
the base of the stack would be reached; and as the evening light in
the direction of the Giant's Hill by Abbot's-Cernel dissolved away,
the white-faced moon of the season arose from the horizon that lay
towards Middleton Abbey and Shottsford on the other side. For the
last hour or two Marian had felt uneasy about Tess, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
not get near enough to speak to, the other women having kept up their
strength by drinking ale, and Tess having done without it through
traditionary dread, owing to its results at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) home in childhood.
But Tess still kept going: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) part she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would
have to leave; and this contingency, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have regarded
with equanimity and even with relief a month or two earlier, had
become a terror since d``Urberville had begun to hover round her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>The sheaf-pitchers and feeders had now worked the rick so low that
people on the ground could talk to them. To Tess's surprise Farmer
Groby came up on the machine to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and said that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) desired to
join her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) friend he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to keep on any longer, and would
send somebody else to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) place. The <div class="bookquote">``friend''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was d``Urberville,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew, and also that this concession had been granted in obedience
to the request of that friend, or enemy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head and
toiled on.

<p/>The time for the rat-catching arrived at last, and the hunt began.
The creatures had crept downwards with the subsidence of the rick
till they were all together at the bottom, and being now uncovered
from their last refuge, they ran across the open ground in all
directions, a loud shriek from the by-this-time half-tipsy Marian
informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) companions that one of the rats had invaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)
person--a terror which the rest of the women had guarded against by
various schemes of skirt-tucking and self-elevation. The rat was
at last dislodged, and, amid the barking of dogs, masculine shouts,
feminine screams, oaths, stampings, and confusion as of Pandemonium,
Tess untied her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) last sheaf; the drum slowed, the whizzing ceased,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stepped from the machine to the ground.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lover, who had only looked on at the rat-catching, was promptly
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--after all--my insulting slap, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in an
underbreath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was so utterly exhausted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not strength
to speak louder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should indeed be foolish to feel offended at anything you say or
do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) answered, in the seductive voice of the Trantridge time.
<div class="bookquote">``How the little limbs tremble! You are as weak as a bled calf, you
know you are; and yet you need have done nothing since I arrived.
How could you be so obstinate? However, I have told the farmer that
he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) has no right to employ women at steam-threshing. It is not proper
work for them; and on all the better class of farms it has been given
up, as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) knows very well. I will walk with you as far as your
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) answered with a jaded gait. <div class="bookquote">``Walk wi' me if you will!
I do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o' my
state. Perhaps--perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I
have been thinking you were. Whatever is meant as kindness I am
grateful for; whatever is meant in any other way I am angered at.
I cannot sense your meaning sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I cannot legitimize our former relations at least I can assist
you. And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than
I formerly showed. My religious mania, or whatever it was, is over.
But I retain a little good nature; I hope I do. Now, Tess, by
all that's tender and strong between man and woman, trust me! I
have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety, both
for yourself and your parents and sisters. I can make them all
comfortable if you will only show confidence in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen 'em lately?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) quickly inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. They didn't know where you were. It was only by chance that I
found you here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The cold moon looked aslant upon Tess's fagged face between the twigs
of the garden-hedge as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) paused outside the cottage which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
temporary home, d``Urberville pausing beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mention my little brothers and sisters--don't make me break
down quite!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If you want to help them--God knows they
need it--do it without telling me. But no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I will
take nothing from you, either for them or for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) did not accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) further, since, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lived with the
household, all was public indoors. No sooner had she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) herself
entered, laved herself in a washing-tub, and shared supper with the
family than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fell into thought, and withdrawing to the table under
the wall, by the light of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own little lamp wrote in a passionate
mood--


<p/>MY OWN HUSBAND,--

<p/>Let me call you so--I must--even if it makes you angry to
think of such an unworthy wife as I. I must cry to you
in my trouble--I have no one else! I am so exposed to
temptation, Angel. I fear to say who it is, and I do not
like to write about it at all. But I cling to you in a way
you cannot think! Can you not come to me now, at once,
before anything terrible happens? O, I know you cannot,
because you are so far away! I think I must die if you do
not come soon, or tell me to come to you. The punishment
you have measured out to me is deserved--I do know that--
well deserved--and you are right and just to be angry with
me. But, Angel, please, please, not to be just--only a
little kind to me, even if I do not deserve it, and come to
me! If you would come, I could die in your arms! I would
be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me!

<p/>Angel, I live entirely for you. I love you too much to
blame you for going away, and I know it was necessary you
should find a farm. Do not think I shall say a word of
sting or bitterness. Only come back to me. I am desolate
without you, my darling, O, so desolate! I do not mind
having to work: but if you will send me one little line,
and say, <div class="bookquote">``I am coming soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I will bide on, Angel--O, so
cheerfully!

<p/>It has been so much my religion ever since we were married
to be faithful to you in every thought and look, that even
when a man speaks a compliment to me before I am aware, it
seems wronging you. Have you never felt one little bit of
what you used to feel when we were at the dairy? If you
have, how can you keep away from me? I am the same women,
Angel, as you fell in love with; yes, the very same!--not
the one you disliked but never saw. What was the past to me
as soon as I met you? It was a dead thing altogether. I
became another woman, filled full of new life from you. How
could I be the early one? Why do you not see this? Dear,
if you would only be a little more conceited, and believe
in yourself so far as to see that you were strong enough to
work this change in me, you would perhaps be in a mind to
come to me, your poor wife.

<p/>How silly I was in my happiness when I thought I could trust
you always to love me! I ought to have known that such as
that was not for poor me. But I am sick at heart, not only
for old times, but for the present. Think--think how it do
hurt my heart not to see you ever--ever! Ah, if I could
only make your dear heart ache one little minute of each day
as mine does every day and all day long, it might lead you
to show pity to your poor lonely one.

<p/>People still say that I am rather pretty, Angel -LRB-handsome is
the word they use, since I wish to be truthful-RRB-. Perhaps I
am what they say. But I do not value my good looks; I only
like to have them because they belong to you, my dear, and
that there may be at least one thing about me worth your
having. So much have I felt this, that when I met with
annoyance on account of the same, I tied up my face in a
bandage as long as people would believe in it. O Angel, I
tell you all this not from vanity--you will certainly know
I do not--but only that you may come to me!

<p/>If you really cannot come to me, will you let me come to
you? I am, as I say, worried, pressed to do what I will
not do. It cannot be that I shall yield one inch, yet I am
in terror as to what an accident might lead to, and I so
defenceless on account of my first error. I cannot say more
about this--it makes me too miserable. But if I break down
by falling into some fearful snare, my last state will be
worse than my first. O God, I cannot think of it! Let me
come at once, or at once come to me!

<p/>I would be content, ay, glad, to live with you as your
servant, if I may not as your wife; so that I could only be
near you, and get glimpses of you, and think of you as mine.

<p/>The daylight has nothing to show me, since you are not here,
and I don't like to see the rooks and starlings in the
field, because I grieve and grieve to miss you who used to
see them with me. I long for only one thing in heaven or
earth or under the earth, to meet you, my own dear! Come
to me--come to me, and save me from what threatens me!--

<p/>Your faithful heartbroken

<p/>TESS



<p/>XLIX


<p/>The appeal duly found its way to the breakfast-table of the quiet
Vicarage to the westward, in that valley where the air is so soft and
the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial
aid by comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb-Ash, and where to
Tess the human world seemed so different -LRB-though it was much the
same-RRB-. It was purely for security that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been requested by
Angel to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) communications through his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) father, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) kept
pretty well informed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) changing addresses in the country he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said old Mr Clare to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had read the envelope,
<div class="bookquote">``if Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next
month, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) told us that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) hoped to do, I think this may hasten his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
plans; for I believe it to be from his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) breathed deeply at
the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent
on to Angel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear fellow, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) will get home safely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clare/Mrs Angel Clare</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs Clare.
<div class="bookquote">``To my dying day I shall feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) has been ill-used. You should
have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) to Cambridge in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) want of faith and given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) the same chance as the other boys had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would have grown out
of it under proper influence, and perhaps would have taken Orders
after all. Church or no Church, it would have been fairer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clare/Mrs Angel Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the only wail with which Mrs Clare ever disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
husband's peace in respect to their sons. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not vent this
often; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was as considerate as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was devout, and knew that
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind too was troubled by doubts as to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) justice in this matter.
Only too often had she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lying awake at night, stifling sighs
for Angel with prayers. But the uncompromising Evangelical did not
even now hold that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would have been justified in giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) son,
an unbeliever, the same academic advantages that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had given to the
two others, when it was possible, if not probable, that those very
advantages might have been used to decry the doctrines which he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had
made it his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) life's mission and desire to propagate, and the mission
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) ordained sons likewise. To put with one hand a pedestal
under the feet of the two faithful ones, and with the other to exalt
the unfaithful by the same artificial means, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) deemed to be alike
inconsistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) convictions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) position, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) hopes.
Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) misnamed Angel, and in secret mourned
over this treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) as Abraham might have mourned over the
doomed Isaac while they went up the hill together. His (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) silent
self-generated regrets were far bitterer than the reproaches which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) wife rendered audible.

<p/>They blamed themselves for this unlucky marriage. If Angel had never
been destined for a farmer he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would never have been thrown with
agricultural girls. They did not distinctly know what had separated
him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wife, nor the date on which the separation had taken
place. At first they had supposed it must be something of the nature
of a serious aversion. But in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) later letters he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) occasionally
alluded to the intention of coming home to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); from which
expressions they hoped the division might not owe its origin to
anything so hopelessly permanent as that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had told them that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
was with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) relatives, and in their doubts they had decided not to
intrude into a situation which they knew no way of bettering.

<p/>The eyes for which Tess's letter was intended were gazing at this
time on a limitless expanse of country from the back of a mule which
was bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) from the interior of the South-American Continent
towards the coast. His (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) experiences of this strange land had been
sad. The severe illness from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had suffered shortly after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) arrival had never wholly left him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had by degrees almost
decided to relinquish his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) hope of farming here, though, as long as
the bare possibility existed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) remaining, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) kept this change
of view a secret from his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) parents.

<p/>The crowds of agricultural labourers who had come out to the country
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wake, dazzled by representations of easy independence, had
suffered, died, and wasted away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would see mothers from English
farms trudging along with their infants in their arms, when the child
would be stricken with fever and would die; the mother would pause
to dig a hole in the loose earth with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bare hands, would bury the
babe therein with the same natural grave-tools, shed one tear, and
again trudge on.

<p/>Angel's original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a
northern or eastern farm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) own country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had come to this
place in a fit of desperation, the Brazil movement among the English
agriculturists having by chance coincided with his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) desire to escape
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) past existence.

<p/>During this time of absence he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had mentally aged a dozen years.
What arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) now as of value in life was less its beauty than
its pathos. Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) now began to discredit the old appraisements of morality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
thought they wanted readjusting. Who was the moral man? Still more
pertinently, who was the moral woman? The beauty or ugliness of
a character lay not only in its achievements, but in its aims and
impulses; its true history lay, not among things done, but among
things willed.

<p/>How, then, about Tess?

<p/>Viewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in these lights, a regret for his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hasty judgement began
to oppress him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). Did he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) reject her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eternally, or did he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) not? He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
could no longer say that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would always reject her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and not to say
that was in spirit to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) now.

<p/>This growing fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) memory coincided in point of time
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) residence at Flintcomb-Ash, but it was before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had felt
herself at liberty to trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) with a word about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) circumstances
or her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was greatly perplexed; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) perplexity as
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) motives in withholding intelligence, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) did not inquire. Thus
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) silence of docility was misinterpreted. How much it really said
if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had understood!--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) adhered with literal exactness to
orders which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had given and forgotten; that despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) natural
fearlessness she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asserted no rights, admitted his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) judgement to be in
every respect the true one, and bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head dumbly thereto.

<p/>In the before-mentioned journey by mules through the interior of the
country, another man rode beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Angel's companion was also an
Englishman, bent on the same errand, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) came from another part
of the island. They were both in a state of mental depression, and
they spoke of home affairs. Confidence begat confidence. With that
curious tendency evinced by men, more especially when in distant
lands, to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they
would on no account mention to friends, Angel admitted to this man
as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) marriage.

<p/>The stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more
peoples than Angel; to his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the
social norm, so immense to domesticity, were no more than are the
irregularities of vale and mountain-chain to the whole terrestrial
curve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) viewed the matter in quite a different light from Angel;
thought that what Tess had been was of no importance beside what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
would be, and plainly told Clare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was wrong in coming away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/>The next day they were drenched in a thunder-storm. Angel's companion
was struck down with fever, and died by the week's end. Clare waited
a few hours to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and then went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) way.

<p/>The cursory remarks of the large-minded stranger, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knew
absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name, were sublimed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
death, and influenced Clare more than all the reasoned ethics of the
philosophers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) own parochialism made him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ashamed by its contrast.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) inconsistencies rushed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) in a flood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had persistently
elevated Hellenic Paganism at the expense of Christianity; yet in
that civilization an illegal surrender was not certain disesteem.
Surely then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) might have regarded that abhorrence of the un-intact
state, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had inherited with the creed of mysticism, as at
least open to correction when the result was due to treachery. A
remorse struck into him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). The words of Izz Huett, never quite stilled
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) memory, came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) had asked Izz if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had replied in the affirmative. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) love him (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) more than
Tess did? No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had replied; Tess would lay down her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life for him (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) herself could do no more.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) thought of Tess as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had appeared on the day of the wedding.
How her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes had lingered upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>); how she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had hung upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) words
as if they were a god's! And during the terrible evening over the
hearth, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) simple soul uncovered itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>), how pitiful her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
face had looked by the rays of the fire, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) inability to realize
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Huett</b></font>) love and protection could possibly be withdrawn.

<p/>Thus from being her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) critic he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) grew to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) advocate. Cynical
things he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) had uttered to himself about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); but no man can be always
a cynic and live; and he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) withdrew them. The mistake of expressing
them had arisen from his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) allowing himself to be influenced by general
principles to the disregard of the particular instance.

<p/>But the reasoning is somewhat musty; lovers and husbands have gone
over the ground before to-day. Clare had been harsh towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>);
there is no doubt of it. Men are too often harsh with women they
love or have loved; women with men. And yet these harshnesses are
tenderness itself when compared with the universal harshness out
of which they grow; the harshness of the position towards the
temperament, of the means towards the aims, of to-day towards
yesterday, of hereafter towards to-day.

<p/>The historic interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) family--that masterful line of
d``Urbervilles--whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had despised as a spent force, touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
sentiments now. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) not known the difference between the
political value and the imaginative value of these things? In
the latter aspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) d``Urberville descent was a fact of great
dimensions; worthless to economics, it was a most useful ingredient
to the dreamer, to the moralizer on declines and falls. It was a
fact that would soon be forgotten--that bit of distinction in poor
Tess's blood and name, and oblivion would fall upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hereditary
link with the marble monuments and leaded skeletons at Kingsbere. So
does Time ruthlessly destroy his (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) own romances. In recalling her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face
again and again, he (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) thought now that he (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) could see therein a flash of
the dignity which must have graced her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) grand-dames; and the vision
sent that _aura_ through his (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) veins which he (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) had formerly felt, and
which left behind it a sense of sickness.

<p/>Despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) not-inviolate past, what still abode in such a woman as
Tess outvalued the freshness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fellows. Was not the gleaning
of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?

<p/>So spoke love renascent, preparing the way for Tess's devoted
outpouring, which was then just being forwarded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) father;
though owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) distance inland it was to be a long time in
reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>).

<p/>Meanwhile the writer's expectation that Angel would come in response
to the entreaty was alternately great and small. What lessened it
was that the facts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life which had led to the parting had
not changed--could never change; and that, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) presence had not
attenuated them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) absence could not. Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) addressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mind to the tender question of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could do to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
best if he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) should arrive. Sighs were expended on the wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had taken more notice of the tunes he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) played on his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) harp, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had inquired more curiously of him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) which were his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) favourite ballads
among those the country-girls sang. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) indirectly inquired of Amby
Seedling, who had followed Izz from Talbothays, and by chance Amby
remembered that, amongst the snatches of melody in which they had
indulged at the dairyman's, to induce the cows to let down their
milk, Clare had seemed to like <div class="bookquote">``Cupid's Gardens'' (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>, <div class="bookquote">``I have parks, I
have hounds'' (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>, and <div class="bookquote">``The break o' the day'' (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>; and had seemed not to care
for <div class="bookquote">``The Tailor's Breeches''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Such a beauty I did grow'' (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>, excellent
ditties as they were.

<p/>To perfect the ballads was now her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) whimsical desire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) practised
them privately at odd moments, especially <div class="bookquote">``The break o' the day'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>:


<p/>Arise, arise, arise!
And pick your love a posy,
All o' the sweetest flowers
That in the garden grow.
The turtle doves and sma' birds
In every bough a-building,
So early in the May-time
At the break o' the day!


<p/>It would have melted the heart of a stone to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) singing these
ditties whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) worked apart from the rest of the girls in this
cold dry time; the tears running down her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheeks all the while at the
thought that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would not, after all, come to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and
the simple silly words of the songs resounding in painful mockery of
the aching heart of the singer.

<p/>Tess was so wrapt up in this fanciful dream that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seemed not to
know how the season was advancing; that the days had lengthened, that
Lady-Day was at hand, and would soon be followed by Old Lady-Day, the
end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) term here.

<p/>But before the quarter-day had quite come, something happened which
made Tess think of far different matters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lodging as
usual one evening, sitting in the downstairs room with the rest of
the family, when somebody knocked at the door and inquired for Tess.
Through the doorway she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw against the declining light a figure
with the height of a woman and the breadth of a child, a tall, thin,
girlish creature whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not recognize in the twilight till the
girl said <div class="bookquote">``Tess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--is it `Liza-Lu?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>asked Tess, in startled accents. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sister,
whom a little over a year ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had left at home as a child, had
sprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation, of which
as yet Lu seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) thin legs, visible below her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) once-long frock, now short by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>)
growing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) uncomfortable hands and arms revealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) youth and
inexperience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have been traipsing about all day, Tess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lu</b></font>)</div>said Lu, with
unemotional gravity, <div class="bookquote">``a-trying to find `ee; and I'm very tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lu</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother is took very bad, and the doctor says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s dying, and as
father is not very well neither, and says `tis wrong for a man of
such a high family as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to slave and drave at common labouring
work, we don't know what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess stood in reverie a long time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) thought of asking
``Liza-Lu to come in and sit down. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had done so, and ``Liza-Lu
was having some tea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) came to a decision. It was imperative that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) should go home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) agreement did not end till Old Lady-Day, the
sixth of April, but as the interval thereto was not a long one she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
resolved to run the risk of starting at once.

<p/>To go that night would be a gain of twelve-hours; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sister
was too tired to undertake such a distance till the morrow. Tess
ran down to where Marian and Izz lived, informed them of what had
happened, and begged them to make the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) case to the farmer.
Returning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) got Lu a supper, and after that, having tucked the
younger into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own bed, packed up as many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) belongings as
would go into a withy basket, and started, directing Lu to follow
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) next morning.



<p/>L


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) plunged into the chilly equinoctial darkness as the clock struck
ten, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lu</b></font>) fifteen miles' walk under the steely stars. In lonely
districts night is a protection rather than a danger to a noiseless
pedestrian, and knowing this, Tess pursued the nearest course along
by-lanes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would almost have feared in the day-time; but
marauders were wanting now, and spectral fears were driven out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mind by thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) proceeded mile after
mile, ascending and descending till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) came to Bulbarrow, and about
midnight looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade
which was all that revealed itself of the vale on whose further side
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was born. Having already traversed about five miles on the
upland, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had now some ten or eleven in the lowland before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
journey would be finished. The winding road downwards became just
visible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) under the wan starlight as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) followed it, and
soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) paced a soil so contrasting with that above it that the
difference was perceptible to the tread and to the smell. It was the
heavy clay land of Blackmoor Vale, and a part of the Vale to which
turnpike-roads had never penetrated. Superstitions linger longest on
these heavy soils. Having once been forest, at this shadowy time it
seemed to assert something of its old character, the far and the near
being blended, and every tree and tall hedge making the most of its
presence. The harts that had been hunted here, the witches that had
been pricked and ducked, the green-spangled fairies that <div class="bookquote">``whickered''
 (<font color='red'><b>the fairies</b></font>)</div>at you as you passed;--the place teemed with beliefs in them still,
and they formed an impish multitude now.

<p/>At Nuttlebury she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) passed the village inn, whose sign creaked in
response to the greeting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) footsteps, which not a human soul
heard but herself. Under the thatched roofs her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mind's eye beheld
relaxed tendons and flaccid muscles, spread out in the darkness
beneath coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares, and
undergoing a bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour
on the morrow, as soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on
Hambledon Hill.

<p/>At three she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
threaded, and entered Marlott, passing the field in which as a
club-girl she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had first seen Angel Clare, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had not danced
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); the sense of disappointment remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) yet. In the
direction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's house she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw a light. It came from the
bedroom window, and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could discern the outline of the house--newly
thatched with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) money--it had all its old effect upon Tess's
imagination. Part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) body and life it ever seemed to be; the
slope of its dormers, the finish of its gables, the broken courses of
brick which topped the chimney, all had something in common with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
personal character. A stupefaction had come into these features, to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) regard; it meant the illness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) opened the door so softly as to disturb nobody; the lower room
was vacant, but the neighbour who was sitting up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother came
to the top of the stairs, and whispered that Mrs Durbeyfield was no
better, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was sleeping just then. Tess prepared herself a
breakfast, and then took her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) place as nurse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's chamber.

<p/>In the morning, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) contemplated the children, they had all a
curiously elongated look; although she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been away little more than
a year, their growth was astounding; and the necessity of applying
herself heart and soul to their needs took her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own cares.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's ill-health was the same indefinite kind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat in
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair as usual. But the day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was unusually
bright. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a rational scheme for living, and Tess asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) what
it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm thinking of sending round to all the old antiqueerians in this
part of England,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``asking them to subscribe to a fund to
maintain me. I'm sure they'd see it as a romantical, artistical,
and proper thing to do. They spend lots o' money in keeping up old
ruins, and finding the bones o' things, and such like; and living
remains must be more interesting to 'em still, if they only knowed
of me. Would that somebody would go round and tell 'em what there
is living among 'em, and they thinking nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)! If Pa`son
Tringham, who discovered me, had lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'d ha' done it, I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess postponed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arguments on this high project till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
grappled with pressing matters in hand, which seemed little improved
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) remittances. When indoor necessities had been eased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) attention to external things. It was now the season for
planting and sowing; many gardens and allotments of the villagers
had already received their spring tillage; but the garden and the
allotment of the Durbeyfields were behindhand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
dismay, that this was owing to their having eaten all the seed
potatoes,--that last lapse of the improvident. At the earliest
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) obtained what others she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could procure, and in a few
days her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father was well enough to see to the garden, under Tess's
persuasive efforts: while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) herself undertook the allotment-plot
which they rented in a field a couple of hundred yards out of the
village.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) liked doing it after the confinement of the sick chamber, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was not now required by reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's improvement.
Violent motion relieved thought. The plot of ground was in a high,
dry, open enclosure, where there were forty or fifty such pieces,
and where labour was at its briskest when the hired labour of the
day had ended. Digging began usually at six o'clock and extended
indefinitely into the dusk or moonlight. Just now heaps of dead
weeds and refuse were burning on many of the plots, the dry weather
favouring their combustion.

<p/>One fine day Tess and ``Liza-Lu worked on here with their neighbours
till the last rays of the sun smote flat upon the white pegs that
divided the plots. As soon as twilight succeeded to sunset the flare
of the couch-grass and cabbage-stalk fires began to light up the
allotments fitfully, their outlines appearing and disappearing under
the dense smoke as wafted by the wind. When a fire glowed, banks
of smoke, blown level along the ground, would themselves become
illuminated to an opaque lustre, screening the workpeople from one
another; and the meaning of the <div class="bookquote">``pillar of a cloud'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>, which was a wall
by day and a light by night, could be understood.

<p/>As evening thickened, some of the gardening men and women gave over
for the night, but the greater number remained to get their planting
done, Tess being among them, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sister home. It was
on one of the couch-burning plots that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) laboured with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fork,
its four shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods
in little clicks. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was completely involved in the smoke
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fire; then it would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) figure free, irradiated by the
brassy glare from the heap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was oddly dressed to-night, and
presented a somewhat staring aspect, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) attire being a gown bleached
by many washings, with a short black jacket over it, the effect of
the whole being that of a wedding and funeral guest in one. The
women further back wore white aprons, which, with their pale faces,
were all that could be seen of them in the gloom, except when at
moments they caught a flash from the flames.

<p/>Westward, the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge which formed the
boundary of the field rose against the pale opalescence of the lower
sky. Above, Jupiter hung like a full-blown jonquil, so bright
as almost to throw a shade. A few small nondescript stars were
appearing elsewhere. In the distance a dog barked, and wheels
occasionally rattled along the dry road.

<p/>Still the prongs continued to click assiduously, for it was not late;
and though the air was fresh and keen there was a whisper of spring
in it that cheered the workers on. Something in the place, the
hours, the crackling fires, the fantastic mysteries of light and
shade, made others as well as Tess enjoy being there. Nightfall,
which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of
summer as a lover, came as a tranquillizer on this March day.

<p/>Nobody looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) companions. The eyes of all were on the
soil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires. Hence as Tess
stirred the clods and sang her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) foolish little songs with scarce
now a hope that Clare would ever hear them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not for a long
time notice the person who worked nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--a man in a long
smockfrock who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) found, was forking the same plot as herself, and
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father had sent there to advance the work.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) became more conscious of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) when the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) digging
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) closer. Sometimes the smoke divided them; then it
swerved, and the two were visible to each other but divided from all
the rest.

<p/>Tess did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fellow-worker, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).
Nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) think of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) further than to recollect that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not
been there when it was broad daylight, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not know
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as any one of the Marlott labourers, which was no wonder, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
absences having been so long and frequent of late years. By-and-by
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dug so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) that the fire-beams were reflected as
distinctly from the steel prongs of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fork as from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own. On
going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
found that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did the same on the other side. The fire flared up,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) beheld the face of d``Urberville.

<p/>The unexpectedness of his (<font color='blue'><b>workpeople</b></font>) presence, the grotesqueness of his (<font color='blue'><b>workpeople</b></font>)
appearance in a gathered smockfrock, such as was now worn only by the
most old-fashioned of the labourers, had a ghastly comicality that
chilled her (<font color='blue'><b>workpeople</b></font>) as to its bearing. D``Urberville emitted a low, long
laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were inclined to joke, I should say, How much this seems like
Paradise!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remarked whimsically, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with an inclined
head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) weakly asked.

<p/>``A jester might say this is just like Paradise. You are Eve, and I
am the old Other One come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior
animal. I used to be quite up in that scene of Milton's when I was
theological. Some of it goes--


<p/><div class="bookquote">'''Empress, the way is ready, and not long,

... If thou accept
My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lead then,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Eve.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so on. My dear Tess, I am only putting this to you as a thing
that you might have supposed or said quite untruly, because you think
so badly of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said you were Satan, or thought it. I don't think of you in
that way at all. My thoughts of you are quite cold, except when you
affront me. What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Entirely. To see you; nothing more. The smockfrock, which I
saw hanging for sale as I came along, was an afterthought, that I
mightn't be noticed. I come to protest against your working like
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I like doing it--it is for my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your engagement at the other place is ended?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going to next? To join your dear husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not bear the humiliating reminder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O--I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``I have no husband!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite true--in the sense you mean. But you have a friend, and
I have determined that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself.
When you get down to your house you will see what I have sent there
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Alec, I wish you wouldn't give me anything at all! I cannot take
it from you! I don't like--it is not right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It IS right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried lightly. <div class="bookquote">``I am not going to see a woman whom
I feel so tenderly for as I do for you in trouble without trying to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am very well off! I am only in trouble about--about--not
about living at all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned, and desperately resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) digging, tears dripping upon
the fork-handle and upon the clods.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About the children--your brothers and sisters,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) resumed. <div class="bookquote">``I've
been thinking of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess's heart quivered--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in a weak place. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
divined her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) chief anxiety. Since returning home her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soul had gone
out to those children with an affection that was passionate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for
them; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can with my assistance. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And with mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How damned foolish this is!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>burst out d``Urberville. <div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
thinks we are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) don't. I've undeceived him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The more fool you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>D``Urberville in anger retreated from her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) to the hedge, where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and rolling
it up and pushing it into the couch-fire, went away.

<p/>Tess could not get on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) digging after this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) felt restless;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had gone back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's house; and taking
the fork in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand proceeded homewards.

<p/>Some twenty yards from the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was met by one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sisters.

<p/>``O, Tessy--what do you think! <div class="bookquote">``Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there's a
lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they
think father is dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its
sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till,
beholding the effect produced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Tess, shan't we talk to father never no more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But father was only a little bit ill!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Tess distractedly.

<p/>``Liza-Lu came up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dropped down just now, and the doctor who was there for mother
said there was no chance for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), because his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) heart was growed in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes; the Durbeyfield couple had changed places; the dying one was
out of danger, and the indisposed one was dead. The news meant even
more than it sounded. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father's life had a value apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
personal achievements, or perhaps it would not have had much. It
was the last of the three lives for whose duration the house and
premises were held under a lease; and it had long been coveted by the
tenant-farmer for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) regular labourers, who were stinted in cottage
accommodation. Moreover, <div class="bookquote">``liviers''  (<font color='red'><b>freeholders</b></font>)</div>were disapproved of in villages
almost as much as little freeholders, because of their independence
of manner, and when a lease determined it was never renewed.

<p/>Thus the Durbeyfields, once d``Urbervilles, saw descending upon them
the destiny which, no doubt, when they were among the Olympians of
the county, they had caused to descend many a time, and severely
enough, upon the heads of such landless ones as they themselves were
now. So do flux and reflux--the rhythm of change--alternate and
persist in everything under the sky.



<p/>LI


<p/>At length it was the eve of Old Lady-Day, and the agricultural world
was in a fever of mobility such as only occurs at that particular
date of the year. It is a day of fulfilment; agreements for outdoor
service during the ensuing year, entered into at Candlemas, are to
be now carried out. The labourers--or <div class="bookquote">``work-folk'' (<font color='red'><b>The labourers work-folk</b></font>)</div>, as they used to
call themselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from
without--who wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to
the new farms.

<p/>These annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here.
When Tess's mother was a child the majority of the field-folk about
Marlott had remained all their lives on one farm, which had been the
home also of their fathers and grandfathers; but latterly the desire
for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch. With the younger
families it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an
advantage. The Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the
family who saw it from a distance, till by residence there it became
it turn their Egypt also; and so they changed and changed.

<p/>However, all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village
life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest. A
depopulation was also going on. The village had formerly contained,
side by side with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and
better-informed class, ranking distinctly above the former--the class
to which Tess's father and mother had belonged--and including the
carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, the huckster, together with
nondescript workers other than farm-labourers; a set of people
who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of
their being lifeholders like Tess's father, or copyholders, or
occasionally, small freeholders. But as the long holdings fell
in, they were seldom again let to similar tenants, and were mostly
pulled down, if not absolutely required by the farmer for his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) hands.
Cottagers who were not directly employed on the land were looked
upon with disfavour, and the banishment of some starved the trade of
others, who were thus obliged to follow. These families, who had
formed the backbone of the village life in the past, who were the
depositaries of the village traditions, had to seek refuge in the
large centres; the process, humorously designated by statisticians as
<div class="bookquote">``the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns'' (<font color='red'><b>statisticians</b></font>)</div>, being
really the tendency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery.

<p/>The cottage accommodation at Marlott having been in this manner
considerably curtailed by demolitions, every house which remained
standing was required by the agriculturist for his (<font color='blue'><b>families</b></font>) work-people. Ever
since the occurrence of the event which had cast such a shadow over
Tess's life, the Durbeyfield family -LRB-whose descent was not credited-RRB-
had been tacitly looked on as one which would have to go when their
lease ended, if only in the interests of morality. It was, indeed,
quite true that the household had not been shining examples either of
temperance, soberness, or chastity. The father, and even the mother,
had got drunk at times, the younger children seldom had gone to
church, and the eldest daughter had made queer unions. By some means
the village had to be kept pure. So on this, the first Lady-Day
on which the Durbeyfields were expellable, the house, being roomy,
was required for a carter with a large family; and Widow Joan,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) daughters Tess and ``Liza-Lu, the boy Abraham, and the younger
children had to go elsewhere.

<p/>On the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark betimes by
reason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky. As it was the last
night they would spend in the village which had been their home and
birthplace, Mrs Durbeyfield, ``Liza-Lu, and Abraham had gone out to
bid some friends goodbye, and Tess was keeping house till they should
return.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was kneeling in the window-bench, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face close to the casement,
where an outer pane of rain-water was sliding down the inner pane of
glass. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes rested on the web of a spider, probably starved long
ago, which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies
ever came, and shivered in the slight draught through the casement.
Tess was reflecting on the position of the household, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) own evil influence. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) not come home, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother
and the children might probably have been allowed to stay on as
weekly tenants. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had been observed almost immediately on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
return by some people of scrupulous character and great influence:
they had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) idling in the churchyard, restoring as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
could with a little trowel a baby's obliterated grave. By this means
they had found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was living here again; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother was scolded
for <div class="bookquote">``harbouring''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>); sharp retorts had ensued from Joan, who had
independently offered to leave at once; she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) had been taken at her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)
word; and here was the result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought never to have come home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess to herself, bitterly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was so intent upon these thoughts that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hardly at first took
note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) saw riding down the
street. Possibly it was owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face being near to the pane
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) so quickly, and directed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse so close to the
cottage-front that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for
plants growing under the wall. It was not till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) touched the window
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) riding-crop that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) observed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The rain had nearly
ceased, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) opened the casement in obedience to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked d``Urberville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not attending,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I heard you, I believe, though I
fancied it was a carriage and horses. I was in a sort of dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ah! you heard the d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville Coach, perhaps. You know the legend,
I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. My--somebody was going to tell it me once, but didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``If you are a genuine d``Urberville I ought not to tell you either,
I suppose. As for me, I'm a sham one, so it doesn't matter. It is
rather dismal. It is that this sound of a non-existent coach can
only be heard by one of d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville blood, and it is held to be
of ill-omen to the one who hears it. It has to do with a murder,
committed by one of the family, centuries ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. One of the family is said to have abducted some

carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) off, and in the struggle he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) killed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--or she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) killed
him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)--I forget which. Such is one version of the tale... I see that
your tubs and buckets are packed. Going away, aren't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard you were, but could hardly believe it; it seems so sudden.
Why is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father's was the last life on the property, and when that dropped we
had no further right to stay. Though we might, perhaps, have stayed
as weekly tenants--if it had not been for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not a--proper woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>D``Urberville's face flushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a blasted shame! Miserable snobs! May their dirty souls
be burnt to cinders!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed in tones of ironic resentment.
<div class="bookquote">``That's why you are going, is it? Turned out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not turned out exactly; but as they said we should have to go
soon, it was best to go now everybody was moving, because there are
better chances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kingsbere. We have taken rooms there. Mother is so foolish about

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But your mother's family are not fit for lodgings, and in a little

can be whitewashed in a day, and your mother can live there quite
comfortably; and I will put the children to a good school. Really
I ought to do something for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we have already taken the rooms at Kingsbere!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) declared.
<div class="bookquote">``And we can wait there--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait--what for? For that nice husband, no doubt. Now look here,
Tess, I know what men are, and, bearing in mind the _grounds_ of

you. Now, though I have been your enemy, I am your friend, even
if you won't believe it. Come to this cottage of mine. We'll get
up a regular colony of fowls, and your mother can attend to them
excellently; and the children can go to school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess breathed more and more quickly, and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do I know that you would do all this? Your views may
change--and then--we should be--my mother would be--homeless
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no--no. I would guarantee you against such as that in writing, if
necessary. Think it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head. But d``Urberville persisted; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had seldom seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) so determined; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would not take a negative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please just tell your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in emphatic tones. <div class="bookquote">``It is
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) business to judge--not yours. I shall get the house swept out
and whitened to-morrow morning, and fires lit; and it will be dry by
the evening, so that you can come straight there. Now mind, I shall
expect you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess again shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) throat swelling with complicated
emotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could not look up at d``Urberville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I owe you something for the past, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resumed. <div class="bookquote">``And you
cured me, too, of that craze; so I am glad--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather you had kept the craze, so that you had kept the
practice which went with it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of this opportunity of repaying you a little. To-morrow I
shall expect to hear your mother's goods unloading... Give me your
hand on it now--dear, beautiful Tess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With the last sentence he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice to a murmur, and put
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand in at the half-open casement. With stormy eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) pulled
the stay-bar quickly, and, in doing so, caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm between the
casement and the stone mullion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damnation--you are very cruel!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, snatching out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no!--I know you didn't do it on purpose. Well I shall expect
you, or your mother and children at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not come--I have plenty of money!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At my father-in-law's, if I ask for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``IF you ask for it. But you won't, Tess; I know you; you'll never
ask for it--you'll starve first!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rode off. Just at the corner of the street he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
met the man with the paint-pot, who asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had deserted the
brethren.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You go to the devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said d``Urberville.

<p/>Tess remained where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was a long while, till a sudden rebellious
sense of injustice caused the region of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes to swell with the
rush of hot tears thither. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband, Angel Clare himself, had,
like others, dealt out hard measure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had! She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
never before admitted such a thought; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had surely! Never
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could swear it from the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soul--had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ever intended to do wrong; yet these hard judgements had
come. Whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sins, they were not sins of intention, but of
inadvertence, and why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) have been punished so persistently?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) passionately seized the first piece of paper that came to hand,
and scribbled the following lines:


<p/>O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel! I do
not deserve it. I have thought it all over carefully,
and I can never, never forgive you! You know that I
did not intend to wrong you--why have you so wronged
me? You are cruel, cruel indeed! I will try to forget
you. It is all injustice I have received at your
hands!
T.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) watched till the postman passed by, ran out to him (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) epistle, and then again took her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) listless place inside the
window-panes.

<p/>It was just as well to write like that as to write tenderly. How
could he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) give way to entreaty? The facts had not changed: there was
no new event to alter his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) opinion.

<p/>It grew darker, the fire-light shining over the room. The two
biggest of the younger children had gone out with their mother; the
four smallest, their ages ranging from three-and-a-half years to
eleven, all in black frocks, were gathered round the hearth babbling
their own little subjects. Tess at length joined them, without
lighting a candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the last night that we shall sleep here, dears, in the house
where we were born,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``We ought to think of it,
oughtn't we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They all became silent; with the impressibility of their age they
were ready to burst into tears at the picture of finality she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
conjured up, though all the day hitherto they had been rejoicing in
the idea of a new place. Tess changed the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sing to me, dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we sing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything you know; I don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a momentary pause; it was broken, first, in one little
tentative note; then a second voice strengthened it, and a third
and a fourth chimed in unison, with words they had learnt at the
Sunday-school--


<p/>Here we suffer grief and pain,
Here we meet to part again;
In Heaven we part no more.


<p/>The four sang on with the phlegmatic passivity of persons who had
long ago settled the question, and there being no mistake about it,
felt that further thought was not required. With features strained
hard to enunciate the syllables they continued to regard the centre
of the flickering fire, the notes of the youngest straying over into
the pauses of the rest.

<p/>Tess turned from them, and went to the window again. Darkness had
now fallen without, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face to the pane as though to
peer into the gloom. It was really to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tears. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) could
only believe what the children were singing; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) were only sure,
how different all would now be; how confidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would leave them
to Providence and their future kingdom! But, in default of that, it
behoved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to do something; to be their Providence; for to Tess,
as to not a few millions of others, there was ghastly satire in the
poet's lines--


<p/>Not in utter nakedness
But trailing clouds of glory do we come.


<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) like, birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal
compulsion, whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed to
justify, and at best could only palliate.

<p/>In the shades of the wet road she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soon discerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother with tall
``Liza-Lu and Abraham. Mrs Durbeyfield's pattens clicked up to the
door, and Tess opened it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see the tracks of a horse outside the window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Joan. <div class="bookquote">``Hev
somebody called?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/>The children by the fire looked gravely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and one murmured--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Tess, the gentleman a-horseback!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) didn't call,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke to me in passing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was the gentleman?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>asked the mother. <div class="bookquote">``Your husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'ll never, never come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>answered Tess in stony hopelessness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then who was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you needn't ask. You've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) before, and so have I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! What did he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Joan curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you when we are settled in our lodging at Kingsbere
to-morrow--every word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had said. Yet a consciousness that in a
physical sense this man alone was her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband seemed to weigh on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
more and more.



<p/>LII


<p/>During the small hours of the next morning, while it was still dark,
dwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their
night's rest by rumbling noises, intermittently continuing till
daylight--noises as certain to recur in this particular first week of
the month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same.
They were the preliminaries of the general removal, the passing of
the empty waggons and teams to fetch the goods of the migrating
families; for it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required
his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) services that the hired man was conveyed to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) destination.
That this might be accomplished within the day was the explanation
of the reverberation occurring so soon after midnight, the aim of
the carters being to reach the door of the outgoing households by
six o'clock, when the loading of their movables at once began.

<p/>But to Tess and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's household no such anxious farmer sent
his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) team. They were only women; they were not regular labourers;
they were not particularly required anywhere; hence they had to hire
a waggon at their own expense, and got nothing sent gratuitously.

<p/>It was a relief to Tess, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) looked out of the window that
morning, to find that though the weather was windy and louring, it
did not rain, and that the waggon had come. A wet Lady-Day was a
spectre which removing families never forgot; damp furniture, damp
bedding, damp clothing accompanied it, and left a train of ills.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother, ``Liza-Lu, and Abraham were also awake, but the younger
children were let sleep on. The four breakfasted by the thin light,
and the <div class="bookquote">``house-ridding''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was taken in hand.

<p/>It proceeded with some cheerfulness, a friendly neighbour or two
assisting. When the large articles of furniture had been packed in
position, a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding, in which
Joan Durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the
journey. After loading there was a long delay before the horses were
brought, these having been unharnessed during the ridding; but at
length, about two o'clock, the whole was under way, the cooking-pot
swinging from the axle of the waggon, Mrs Durbeyfield and family
at the top, the matron having in her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) lap, to prevent injury to its
works, the head of the clock, which, at any exceptional lurch of the
waggon, struck one, or one-and-a-half, in hurt tones. Tess and the
next eldest girl walked alongside till they were out of the village.

<p/>They had called on a few neighbours that morning and the previous
evening, and some came to see them off, all wishing them well,
though, in their secret hearts, hardly expecting welfare possible
to such a family, harmless as the Durbeyfields were to all except
themselves. Soon the equipage began to ascend to higher ground,
and the wind grew keener with the change of level and soil.

<p/>The day being the sixth of April, the Durbeyfield waggon met many
other waggons with families on the summit of the load, which was
built on a wellnigh unvarying principle, as peculiar, probably, to
the rural labourer as the hexagon to the bee. The groundwork of the
arrangement was the family dresser, which, with its shining handles,
and finger-marks, and domestic evidences thick upon it, stood
importantly in front, over the tails of the shaft-horses, in its
erect and natural position, like some Ark of the Covenant that they
were bound to carry reverently.

<p/>Some of the households were lively, some mournful; some were stopping
at the doors of wayside inns; where, in due time, the Durbeyfield
menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers.

<p/>During the halt Tess's eyes fell upon a three-pint blue mug, which
was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine
section of a household, sitting on the summit of a load that had also
drawn up at a little distance from the same inn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) followed one of
the mug's journeys upward, and perceived it to be clasped by hands
whose owner she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) well knew. Tess went towards the waggon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marian and Izz!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cried to the girls, for it was they, sitting
with the moving family at whose house they had lodged. <div class="bookquote">``Are you
house-ridding to-day, like everybody else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were, they said. It had been too rough a life for them at
Flintcomb-Ash, and they had come away, almost without notice,
leaving Groby to prosecute them if he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) chose. They told Tess their
destination, and Tess told them hers.

<p/>Marian leant over the load, and lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know that
the gentleman who follows `ee--you'll guess who I mean--came to ask
for `ee at Flintcomb after you had gone? We didn't tell'n where you
was, knowing you wouldn't wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--but I did see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Tess murmured. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) know where you be going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Husband come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) acquaintance goodbye--for the respective carters had now
come out from the inn--and the two waggons resumed their journey in
opposite directions; the vehicle whereon sat Marian, Izz, and the
ploughman's family with whom they had thrown in their lot, being
brightly painted, and drawn by three powerful horses with shining
brass ornaments on their harness; while the waggon on which Mrs
Durbeyfield and her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) family rode was a creaking erection that would
scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load; one which had
known no paint since it was made, and drawn by two horses only.
The contrast well marked the difference between being fetched by a
thriving farmer and conveying oneself whither no hirer waited one's
coming.

<p/>The distance was great--too great for a day's journey--and it was
with the utmost difficulty that the horses performed it. Though they
had started so early, it was quite late in the afternoon when they
turned the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland
called Greenhill. While the horses stood to stale and breathe
themselves Tess looked around. Under the hill, and just ahead of
them, was the half-dead townlet of their pilgrimage, Kingsbere,
where lay those ancestors of whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father had spoken and sung to
painfulness: Kingsbere, the spot of all spots in the world which
could be considered the d``Urbervilles' home, since they had resided
there for full five hundred years.

<p/>A man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them, and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beheld the nature of their waggon-load he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield, I reckon?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said to
Tess's mother, who had descended to walk the remainder of the way.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) nodded. ``Though widow of the late Sir John d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville, poor
nobleman, if I cared for my rights; and returning to the domain of
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) forefathers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh? Well, I know nothing about that; but if you be Mrs Durbeyfield,
I am sent to tell `ee that the rooms you wanted be let. We didn't
know that you was coming till we got your letter this morning--when
'twas too late. But no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man had noticed the face of Tess, which had become ash-pale at
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intelligence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother looked hopelessly at fault. <div class="bookquote">``What
shall we do now, Tess?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a welcome to
your ancestors' lands! However, let's try further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>They moved on into the town, and tried with all their might, Tess
remaining with the waggon to take care of the children whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
mother and ``Liza-Lu made inquiries. At the last return of Joan to
the vehicle, an hour later, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) search for accommodation had
still been fruitless, the driver of the waggon said the goods must be
unloaded, as the horses were half-dead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was bound to return
part of the way at least that night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--unload it here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Joan recklessly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get shelter
somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the driver loth</b></font>)</div><p/>The waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall, in a spot screened
from view, and the driver, nothing loth, soon hauled down the poor
heap of household goods. This done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) paid him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), reducing herself
to almost her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) last shilling thereby, and he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) moved off and left them,
only too glad to get out of further dealings with such a family. It
was a dry night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) guessed that they would come to no harm.

<p/>Tess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture. The cold sunlight
of this spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and
kettles, upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze,
upon the brass handles of the dresser, upon the wicker-cradle they
had all been rocked in, and upon the well-rubbed clock-case, all of
which gave out the reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to
the vicissitudes of a roofless exposure for which they were never
made. Round about were deparked hills and slopes--now cut up
into little paddocks--and the green foundations that showed where
the d``Urberville mansion once had stood; also an outlying stretch
of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the estate. Hard by,
the aisle of the church called the d``Urberville Aisle looked on
imperturbably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't your family vault your own freehold?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess's mother, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard. ``Why,
of course `tis, and that's where we will camp, girls, till the place
of your ancestors finds us a roof! Now, Tess and <div class="bookquote">``Liza and Abraham,
you help me. We'll make a nest for these children, and then we'll
have another look round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old
four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and
erected under the south wall of the church, the part of the building
known as the d``Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay.
Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of
many lights, its date being the fifteenth century. It was called
the d``Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned
heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield's old seal and spoon.

<p/>Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent
of it, and put the smaller children inside. <div class="bookquote">``If it comes to the
worst we can sleep there too, for one night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But let us
try further on, and get something for the dears to eat! O, Tess,
what's the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves
us like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Accompanied by ``Liza-Lu and the boy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) again ascended the little
lane which secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got
into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down.
``Ah--I'm looking for you!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, riding up to them. <div class="bookquote">``This is
indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alec</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Alec d``Urberville. <div class="bookquote">``Where is Tess?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) cursorily signified the
direction of the church, and went on, d``Urberville saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in
their search for shelter, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just heard. When they had
gone, d``Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on
foot.

<p/>In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead,
remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could
be done to make them comfortable just then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) walked about the
churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall.
The door of the church was unfastened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) entered it for the
first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) life.

<p/>Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of
the family, covering in their dates several centuries. They were
canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced
and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes
remaining like martin-holes in a sandcliff. Of all the reminders
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had ever received that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) people were socially extinct,
there was none so forcible as this spoliation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed:


<p/>OSTIUM SEPULCHRI ANTIQUAE FAMILIAE D``URBERVILLE


<p/>Tess did not read Church-Latin like a Cardinal, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) knew that
this was the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ancestral sepulchre, and that the tall
knights of whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) father had chanted in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cups lay inside.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) musingly turned to withdraw, passing near an altar-tomb, the
oldest of them all, on which was a recumbent figure. In the dusk she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
had not noticed it before, and would hardly have noticed it now but
for an odd fancy that the effigy moved. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) drew close
to it she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) discovered all in a moment that the figure was a living
person; and the shock to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sense of not having been alone was so
violent that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was quite overcome, and sank down nigh to fainting,
not, however, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had recognized Alec d``Urberville in the form.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) leapt off the slab and supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) said smiling, <div class="bookquote">``and got up there not to
interrupt your meditations. A family gathering, is it not, with
these old fellows under us here? Listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) stamped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) heel heavily on the floor; whereupon there arose
a hollow echo from below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That shook them a bit, I'll warrant!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) continued. ``And you
thought I was the mere stone reproduction of one of them. But no.
The old order changeth. The little finger of the sham d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville
can do more for you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath...
Now command me. What shall I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will--I'll look for your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) blandly. But in passing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) whispered: <div class="bookquote">``Mind this; you'll be civil yet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Alec</b></font>) was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) bent down upon the entrance to the vaults, and
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why am I on the wrong side of this door!''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In the meantime Marian and Izz Huett had journeyed onward with the
chattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of Canaan--
the Egypt of some other family who had left it only that morning.
But the girls did not for a long time think of where they were going.
Their talk was of Angel Clare and Tess, and Tess's persistent lover,
whose connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) previous history they had partly heard and
partly guessed ere this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tisn't as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had never known him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) afore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess lover</b></font>)</div>said Marian. ``His (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
having won her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) once makes all the difference in the world. <div class="bookquote">``Twould
be a thousand pities if he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) were to tole her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) away again. Mr Clare can
never be anything to us, Izz; and why should we grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and not try to mend this quarrel? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) could on'y know what straits
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s put to, and what's hovering round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) might come to take care
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could we let him (<font color='blue'><b>Izz</b></font>) know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They thought of this all the way to their destination; but the bustle
of re-establishment in their new place took up all their attention
then. But when they were settled, a month later, they heard of
Clare's approaching return, though they had learnt nothing more of
Tess. Upon that, agitated anew by their attachment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), yet
honourably disposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), Marian uncorked the penny ink-bottle they
shared, and a few lines were concocted between the two girls.


<p/>HONOUR``D SIR--

<p/>Look to your Wife if you do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) do
love you. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) is sore put to by an Enemy in the shape
of a Friend. Sir, there is one near her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) who ought to be
Away. A woman should not be try'd beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) Strength,
and continual dropping will wear away a Stone--ay,
more--a Diamond.

<p/>FROM TWO WELL-WISHERS


<p/>This was addressed to Angel Clare at the only place they had ever
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to be connected with, Emminster Vicarage; after which they
continued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity,
which made them sing in hysterical snatches and weep at the same
time.


<p/>END OF PHASE THE SIXTH





<p/>Phase the Seventh: Fulfilment



<p/>LIII


<p/>It was evening at Emminster Vicarage. The two customary candles were
burning under their green shades in the Vicar's study, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had not
been sitting there. Occasionally he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) came in, stirred the small fire
which sufficed for the increasing mildness of the spring, and went
out again; sometimes pausing at the front door, going on to the
drawing-room, then returning again to the front door.

<p/>It faced westward, and though gloom prevailed inside, there was still
light enough without to see with distinctness. Mrs Clare, who had
been sitting in the drawing-room, followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hither.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Plenty of time yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) doesn't reach Chalk-Newton
till six, even if the train should be punctual, and ten miles of
country-road, five of them in Crimmercrock Lane, are not jogged over
in a hurry by our old horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) has done it in an hour with us, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus they passed the minutes, each well knowing that this was only
waste of breath, the one essential being simply to wait.

<p/>At length there was a slight noise in the lane, and the old
pony-chaise appeared indeed outside the railings. They saw alight
therefrom a form which they affected to recognize, but would actually
have passed by in the street without identifying had he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) not got out
of their carriage at the particular moment when a particular person
was due.

<p/>Mrs Clare rushed through the dark passage to the door, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
husband came more slowly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>The new arrival, who was just about to enter, saw their anxious faces
in the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles because
they confronted the last rays of day; but they could only see his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
shape against the light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, my boy, my boy--home again at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Clare/Mrs Angel Clare</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Clare, who cared
no more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused
all this separation than for the dust upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) clothes. What woman,
indeed, among the most faithful adherents of the truth, believes the
promises and threats of the Word in the sense in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believes
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own children, or would not throw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) theology to the wind if
weighed against their happiness? As soon as they reached the room
where the candles were lighted she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, it is not Angel--not my son--the Angel who went away!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried
in all the irony of sorrow, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned herself aside.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father, too, was shocked to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), so reduced was that figure
from its former contours by worry and the bad season that Clare had
experienced, in the climate to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had so rashly hurried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
first aversion to the mockery of events at home. You could see the
skeleton behind the man, and almost the ghost behind the skeleton.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) matched Crivelli's dead _Christus_. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sunken eye-pits were of
morbid hue, and the light in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes had waned. The angular hollows
and lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aged ancestors had succeeded to their reign in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
face twenty years before their time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was ill over there, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am all right now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As if, however, to falsify this assertion, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs seemed to give
way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly sat down to save himself from falling. It was
only a slight attack of faintness, resulting from the tedious day's
journey, and the excitement of arrival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has any letter come for me lately?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I received the
last you sent on by the merest chance, and after considerable delay
through being inland; or I might have come sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was from your wife, we supposed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Only one other had recently come. They had not sent it on to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would start for home so soon.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hastily opened the letter produced, and was much disturbed to read
in Tess's handwriting the sentiments expressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) last hurried
scrawl to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).


<p/>O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel! I do
not deserve it. I have thought it all over carefully,
and I can never, never forgive you! You know that I
did not intend to wrong you--why have you so wronged
me? You are cruel, cruel indeed! I will try to forget
you. It is all injustice I have received at your
hands!
T.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite true!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel, throwing down the letter. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will never be reconciled to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, Angel, be so anxious about a mere child of the soil!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Child of the soil! Well, we all are children of the soil. I wish
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were so in the sense you mean; but let me now explain to you what
I have never explained before, that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father is a descendant in the
male line of one of the oldest Norman houses, like a good many others
who lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages, and are dubbed
`sons of the soil.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) soon retired to bed; and the next morning, feeling exceedingly
unwell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) room pondering. The circumstances amid
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had left Tess were such that though, while on the south of
the Equator and just in receipt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) loving epistle, it had seemed
the easiest thing in the world to rush back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) arms the moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) chose to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had arrived it was not so easy
as it had seemed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was passionate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) present letter,
showing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) estimate of him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had changed under his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) delay--too
justly changed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) sadly owned,--made him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) ask himself if it would
be wise to confront her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) unannounced in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) parents.
Supposing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) love had indeed turned to dislike during the last
weeks of separation, a sudden meeting might lead to bitter words.

<p/>Clare therefore thought it would be best to prepare Tess and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
family by sending a line to Marlott announcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) return, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was still living with them there, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had arranged
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to do when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) left England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) despatched the inquiry that
very day, and before the week was out there came a short reply from
Mrs Durbeyfield which did not remove his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) embarrassment, for it bore
no address, though to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) surprise it was not written from Marlott.


<p/>SIR,

<p/>J write these few lines to say that my Daughter is away
from me at present, and J am not sure when she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) will
return, but J will let you know as Soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) do.
J do not feel at liberty to tell you Where she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) is
temperly biding. J should say that me and my Family
have left Marlott for some Time.--

<p/>Yours,

<p/>J. DURBEYFIELD


<p/>It was such a relief to Clare to learn that Tess was at least
apparently well that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) mother's stiff reticence as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
whereabouts did not long distress him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). They were all angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>),
evidently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would wait till Mrs Durbeyfield could inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) of
Tess's return, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) letter implied to be soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) deserved no
more. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had been a love <div class="bookquote">``which alters when it alteration finds'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had undergone some strange experiences in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) absence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had seen
the virtual Faustina in the literal Cornelia, a spiritual Lucretia in
a corporeal Phryne; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had thought of the woman taken and set in the
midst as one deserving to be stoned, and of the wife of Uriah being
made a queen; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Uriah</b></font>) had asked himself why he (<font color='blue'><b>Uriah</b></font>) had not judged Tess
constructively rather than biographically, by the will rather than
by the deed?

<p/>A day or two passed while he (<font color='blue'><b>Uriah</b></font>) waited at his (<font color='blue'><b>Uriah</b></font>) father's house for the
promised second note from Joan Durbeyfield, and indirectly to recover
a little more strength. The strength showed signs of coming back,
but there was no sign of Joan's letter. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Uriah</b></font>) hunted up the
old letter sent on to him (<font color='blue'><b>Uriah</b></font>) in Brazil, which Tess had written from
Flintcomb-Ash, and re-read it. The sentences touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Uriah</b></font>) now as
much as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Uriah</b></font>) had first perused them.


<p/>... I must cry to you in my trouble--I have no one
else! ... I think I must die if you do not come
soon, or tell me to come to you... please, please,
not to be just--only a little kind to me ... If
you would come, I could die in your arms! I would
be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven
me! ... if you will send me one little line, and say,
<div class="bookquote">``I am coming soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I will bide on, Angel--O, so
cheerfully! ... think how it do hurt my heart not to
see you ever--ever! Ah, if I could only make your
dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine
does every day and all day long, it might lead you to
show pity to your poor lonely one. ... I would be
content, ay, glad, to live with you as your servant,
if I may not as your wife; so that I could only be
near you, and get glimpses of you, and think of you
as mine. ... I long for only one thing in heaven
or earth or under the earth, to meet you, my own
dear! Come to me--come to me, and save me from what
threatens me!


<p/>Clare determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would no longer believe in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) more recent
and severer regard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), but would go and find her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had applied for any money during his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) absence.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father returned a negative, and then for the first time it
occurred to Angel that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pride had stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) way, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had suffered privation. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) remarks his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) parents now gathered
the real reason of the separation; and their Christianity was such
that, reprobates being their especial care, the tenderness towards
Tess which her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) blood, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) simplicity, even her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) poverty, had not
engendered, was instantly excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sin.

<p/>Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was hastily packing together a few articles for his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) journey
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to hand--the
one from Marian and Izz Huett, beginning--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Honour'd Sir, Look to your Wife if you do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) do
love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div>and signed, <div class="bookquote">``From Two Well-Wishers.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Izz/Izz Huett</b></font>)</div><p/>LIV


<p/>In a quarter of an hour Clare was leaving the house, whence his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
mother watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thin figure as it disappeared into the street.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had declined to borrow his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father's old mare, well knowing of
its necessity to the household. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went to the inn, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hired
a trap, and could hardly wait during the harnessing. In a very few
minutes after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was driving up the hill out of the town which,
three or four months earlier in the year, Tess had descended with
such hopes and ascended with such shattered purposes.

<p/>Benvill Lane soon stretched before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>), its hedges and trees purple
with buds; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) was looking at other things, and only recalled
himself to the scene sufficiently to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) to keep the way. In
something less than an hour-and-a-half he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) had skirted the south of
the King's Hintock estates and ascended to the untoward solitude of
Cross-in-Hand, the unholy stone whereon Tess had been compelled by
Alec d``Urberville, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) whim of reformation, to swear the strange
oath that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) would never wilfully tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) again. The pale and
blasted nettle-stems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly
in the banks, young green nettles of the present spring growing from
their roots.

<p/>Thence he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other
Hintocks, and, turning to the right, plunged into the bracing
calcareous region of Flintcomb-Ash, the address from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) had
written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) in one of the letters, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) supposed to be
the place of sojourn referred to by her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) mother. Here, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>)
did not find her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>); and what added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Norman</b></font>) depression was the discovery
that no <div class="bookquote">``Mrs Clare''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by
the farmer himself, though Tess was remembered well enough by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
Christian name. His (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) name she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had obviously never used during their
separation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dignified sense of their total severance was
shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had
chosen to undergo -LRB-of which he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) now learnt for the first time-RRB- rather
than apply to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) father for more funds.

<p/>From this place they told him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) Tess Durbeyfield had gone, without due
notice, to the home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) parents on the other side of Blackmoor,
and it therefore became necessary to find Mrs Durbeyfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had
told him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was not now at Marlott, but had been curiously reticent
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) actual address, and the only course was to go to Marlott
and inquire for it. The farmer who had been so churlish with Tess
was quite smooth-tongued to Clare, and lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) a horse and man to
drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) towards Marlott, the gig he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had arrived in being sent back
to Emminster; for the limit of a day's journey with that horse was
reached.

<p/>Clare would not accept the loan of the farmer's vehicle for a further
distance than to the outskirts of the Vale, and, sending it back with
the man who had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put up at an inn, and next day entered
on foot the region wherein was the spot of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dear Tess's birth.
It was as yet too early in the year for much colour to appear in the
gardens and foliage; the so-called spring was but winter overlaid
with a thin coat of greenness, and it was of a parcel with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
expectations.

<p/>The house in which Tess had passed the years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) childhood was
now inhabited by another family who had never known her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>). The new
residents were in the garden, taking as much interest in their own
doings as if the homestead had never passed its primal time in
conjunction with the histories of others, beside which the histories
of these were but as a tale told by an idiot. They walked about the
garden paths with thoughts of their own concerns entirely uppermost,
bringing their actions at every moment in jarring collision with the
dim ghosts behind them, talking as though the time when Tess lived
there were not one whit intenser in story than now. Even the spring
birds sang over their heads as if they thought there was nobody
missing in particular.

<p/>On inquiry of these precious innocents, to whom even the name of
their predecessors was a failing memory, Clare learned that John
Durbeyfield was dead; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) widow and children had left Marlott,
declaring that they were going to live at Kingsbere, but instead of
doing so had gone on to another place they mentioned. By this time
Clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain Tess, and hastened
away from its hated presence without once looking back.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) way was by the field in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had first beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) at the
dance. It was as bad as the house--even worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) passed on through
the churchyard, where, amongst the new headstones, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) saw one of a
somewhat superior design to the rest. The inscription ran thus:


<p/>In memory of John Durbeyfield, rightly d``Urberville, of
the once powerful family of that Name, and Direct
Descendant through an illustrious Line from Sir Pagan
d``Urberville, one of the Knights of the Conqueror. Died
March 10th, 18--

<p/>HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN.


<p/>Some man, apparently the sexton, had observed Clare standing there,
and drew nigh. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, sir, now that's a man who didn't want to lie
here, but wished to be carried to Kingsbere, where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ancestors be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why didn't they respect his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--no money. Bless your soul, sir, why--there, I wouldn't wish to
say it everywhere, but--even this headstone, for all the flourish
wrote upon en, is not paid for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, who put it up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man told the name of a mason in the village, and, on leaving the
churchyard, Clare called at the mason's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) found that the
statement was true, and paid the bill. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) turned in the
direction of the migrants.

<p/>The distance was too long for a walk, but Clare felt such a strong
desire for isolation that at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would neither hire a conveyance
nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) might eventually
reach the place. At Shaston, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) must hire; but
the way was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not enter Joan's place till about seven
o'clock in the evening, having traversed a distance of over twenty
miles since leaving Marlott.

<p/>The village being small he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had little difficulty in finding Mrs
Durbeyfield's tenement, which was a house in a walled garden,
remote from the main road, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had stowed away her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) clumsy old
furniture as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) could. It was plain that for some reason or
other she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) had not wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) call to
be somewhat of an intrusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) came to the door herself, and the
light from the evening sky fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) face.

<p/>This was the first time that Clare had ever met her (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was too
preoccupied to observe more than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Durbeyfield</b></font>) was still a handsome woman,
in the garb of a respectable widow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was obliged to explain that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was Tess's husband, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) object in coming there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did it
awkwardly enough. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>) at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``You said
you would write to me again, but you have not done so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>)'ve not come home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Joan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know if she (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>) is well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't. But you ought to, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I admit it. Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>) staying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>From the beginning of the interview Joan had disclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)
embarrassment by keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) hand to the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--don't know exactly where she (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>) is staying,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>)
was--but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was she (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>) is not there now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) evasiveness she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) paused again, and the younger children had by
this time crept to the door, where, pulling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother's skirts,
the youngest murmured--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this the gentleman who is going to marry Tess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has married her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Joan whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Go inside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) efforts for reticence, and asked--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think Tess would wish me to try and find her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)? If not, of
course--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wouldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was turning away; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thought of Tess's tender letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) retorted passionately. <div class="bookquote">``I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) better
than you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very likely, sir; for I have never really known her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please tell me her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) address, Mrs Durbeyfield, in kindness to a lonely
wretched man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>Tess's mother again restlessly swept her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) vertical hand, and seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) suffered, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at last said, is
a low voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) is at Sandbourne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--where there? Sandbourne has become a large place, they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know more particularly than I have said--Sandbourne. For
myself, I was never there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan/Joan Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>It was apparent that Joan spoke the truth in this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>)
no further.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in want of anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``We are fairly well provided for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Without entering the house Clare turned away. There was a station
three miles ahead, and paying off his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) coachman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) walked thither.
The last train to Sandbourne left shortly after, and it bore Clare
on its wheels.



<p/>LV


<p/>At eleven o'clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the
hotels and telegraphed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) address to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father immediately on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) walked out into the streets of Sandbourne. It was too
late to call on or inquire for any one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) reluctantly postponed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) purpose till the morning. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not retire to rest just
yet.

<p/>This fashionable watering-place, with its eastern and its western
stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its
covered gardens, was, to Angel Clare, like a fairy place suddenly
created by the stroke of a wand, and allowed to get a little dusty.
An outlying eastern tract of the enormous Egdon Waste was close at
hand, yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a
glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up.
Within the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity
of the soil was prehistoric, every channel an undisturbed British
trackway; not a sod having been turned there since the days of the
Caesars. Yet the exotic had grown here, suddenly as the prophet's
gourd; and had drawn hither Tess.

<p/>By the midnight lamps he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) went up and down the winding way of this new
world in an old one, and could discern between the trees and against
the stars the lofty roofs, chimneys, gazebos, and towers of the
numerous fanciful residences of which the place was composed. It
was a city of detached mansions; a Mediterranean lounging-place on
the English Channel; and as seen now by night it seemed even more
imposing than it was.

<p/>The sea was near at hand, but not intrusive; it murmured, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>)
thought it was the pines; the pines murmured in precisely the same
tones, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) thought they were the sea.

<p/>Where could Tess possibly be, a cottage-girl, his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) young wife, amidst
all this wealth and fashion? The more he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) pondered, the more was he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>)
puzzled. Were there any cows to milk here? There certainly were
no fields to till. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was most probably engaged to do something in
one of these large houses; and he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) sauntered along, looking at the
chamber-windows and their lights going out one by one, and wondered
which of them might be hers.

<p/>Conjecture was useless, and just after twelve o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) entered
and went to bed. Before putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) light he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) re-read Tess's
impassioned letter. Sleep, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) could not--so near her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), yet
so far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) continually lifted the window-blind and
regarded the backs of the opposite houses, and wondered behind which
of the sashes she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) reposed at that moment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) might almost as well have sat up all night. In the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>)
arose at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of
the chief post-office. At the door he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) met an intelligent postman
coming out with letters for the morning delivery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know the address of a Mrs Clare?''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>asked Angel. The postman
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) head.

<p/>Then, remembering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) would have been likely to continue the use
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) maiden name, Clare said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of a Miss Durbeyfield?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Durbeyfield?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the postman</b></font>)</div><p/>This also was strange to the postman addressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``and without the name of the house `tis impossible to find
'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was
repeated to him (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>).

<p/>``I know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d<div class="bookquote">``Urberville
at The Herons,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the second.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>cried Clare, pleased to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had reverted to
the real pronunciation. <div class="bookquote">``What place is The Herons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``A stylish lodging-house. <div class="bookquote">``Tis all lodging-houses here, bless `ee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened
thither, arriving with the milkman. The Herons, though an ordinary
villa, stood in its own grounds, and was certainly the last place
in which one would have expected to find lodgings, so private was
its appearance. If poor Tess was a servant here, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) feared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
would go to the back-door to that milkman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was inclined to go
thither also. However, in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) doubts he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) turned to the front, and
rang.

<p/>The hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door. Clare
inquired for Teresa d``Urberville or Durbeyfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs d'Urberville?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) felt glad, even though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not adopted his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you kindly tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) that a relative is anxious to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is rather early. What name shall I give, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Angel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; Angel. It is my Christian name. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>)'ll understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) is awake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was shown into the front room--the dining-room--and looked out
through the spring curtains at the little lawn, and the rhododendrons
and other shrubs upon it. Obviously her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) position was by no means so
bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had feared, and it crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) must somehow
have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
for one moment. Soon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the
stairs, at which his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) heart thumped so painfully that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could hardly
stand firm. <div class="bookquote">``Dear me! what will she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) think of me, so altered as I
am!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said to himself; and the door opened.

<p/>Tess appeared on the threshold--not at all as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had expected to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)--bewilderingly otherwise, indeed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) great natural beauty
was, if not heightened, rendered more obvious by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) attire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
was loosely wrapped in a cashmere dressing-gown of gray-white,
embroidered in half-mourning tints, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) wore slippers of the same
hue. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) neck rose out of a frill of down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) well-remembered
cable of dark-brown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the
back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head and partly hanging on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) shoulder--the evident
result of haste.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arms, but they had fallen again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) side;
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had not come forward, remaining still in the opening of the
doorway. Mere yellow skeleton that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) felt the contrast
between them, and thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) appearance distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tess!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said huskily, <div class="bookquote">``can you forgive me for going away? Can't
you--come to me? How do you get to be--like this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too late,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) voice sounding hard through the room,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) eyes shining unnaturally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not think rightly of you--I did not see you as you were!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
continued to plead. <div class="bookquote">``I have learnt to since, dearest Tessy mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too late, too late!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand in the impatience of
a person whose tortures cause every instant to seem an hour. <div class="bookquote">``Don't
come close to me, Angel! No--you must not. Keep away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled
down by illness? You are not so fickle--I am come on purpose for
you--my mother and father will welcome you now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--O, yes, yes! But I say, I say it is too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seemed to feel like a fugitive in a dream, who tries to move
away, but cannot. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know all--don't you know it? Yet how
do you come here if you do not know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I inquired here and there, and I found the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I waited and waited for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) went on, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) tones suddenly
resuming their old fluty pathos. <div class="bookquote">``But you did not come! And I wrote
to you, and you did not come! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kept on saying you would never come
any more, and that I was a foolish woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very kind to me,
and to mother, and to all of us after father's death. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has won me back to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) keenly, then, gathering her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) meaning, flagged
like one plague-stricken, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) glance sank; it fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hands,
which, once rosy, were now white and more delicate.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is upstairs. I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now, because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me a lie--that you
would not come again; and you HAVE come! These clothes are what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s
put upon me: I didn't care what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did wi' me! But--will you go
away, Angel, please, and never come any more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>They stood fixed, their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with
a joylessness pitiful to see. Both seemed to implore something to
shelter them from reality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--it is my fault!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not get on. Speech was as inexpressive as silence. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had a vague consciousness of one thing, though it was not clear
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) till later; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) original Tess had spiritually ceased to
recognize the body before him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) as hers--allowing it to drift, like a
corpse upon the current, in a direction dissociated from its living
will.

<p/>A few instants passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) found that Tess was gone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) face
grew colder and more shrunken as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) stood concentrated on the moment,
and a minute or two after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) found himself in the street, walking
along he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not know whither.



<p/>LVI


<p/>Mrs Brooks, the lady who was the householder at The Herons and owner
of all the handsome furniture, was not a person of an unusually
curious turn of mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) was too deeply materialized, poor woman,
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) long and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon
Profit-and-Loss, to retain much curiousity for its own sake, and
apart from possible lodgers' pockets. Nevertheless, the visit of
Angel Clare to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) well-paying tenants, Mr and Mrs d``Urberville, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Urberville</b></font>) deemed them, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and
manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled
down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade.

<p/>Tess had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) husband from the doorway, without entering
the dining-room, and Mrs Brooks, who stood within the partly-closed
door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) own sitting-room at the back of the passage, could
hear fragments of the conversation--if conversation it could be
called--between those two wretched souls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) heard Tess re-ascend
the stairs to the first floor, and the departure of Clare, and the
closing of the front door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). Then the door of the room
above was shut, and Mrs Brooks knew that Tess had re-entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
apartment. As the young lady was not fully dressed, Mrs Brooks knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) would not emerge again for some time.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) accordingly ascended the stairs softly, and stood at the door of
the front room--a drawing-room, connected with the room immediately
behind it -LRB-which was a bedroom-RRB- by folding-doors in the common
manner. This first floor, containing Mrs Brooks's best apartments,
had been taken by the week by the d``Urbervilles. The back room was
now in silence; but from the drawing-room there came sounds.

<p/>All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) could at first distinguish of them was one syllable,
continually repeated in a low note of moaning, as if it came from a
soul bound to some Ixionian wheel--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O--O--O!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then a silence, then a heavy sigh, and again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O--O--O!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The landlady</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlady looked through the keyhole. Only a small space of the
room inside was visible, but within that space came a corner of the
breakfast table, which was already spread for the meal, and also a
chair beside. Over the seat of the chair Tess's face was bowed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
posture being a kneeling one in front of it; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hands were clasped
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head, the skirts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) dressing-gown and the embroidery of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) night-gown flowed upon the floor behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) stockingless
feet, from which the slippers had fallen, protruded upon the carpet.
It was from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair.

<p/>Then a man's voice from the adjoining bedroom--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not answer, but went on, in a tone which was a soliloquy
rather than an exclamation, and a dirge rather than a soliloquy.
Mrs Brooks could only catch a portion:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then my dear, dear husband came home to me ... and I did not
know it! ... And you had used your cruel persuasion upon me ... you
did not stop using it--no--you did not stop! My little sisters and
brothers and my mother's needs--they were the things you moved me
by ... and you said my husband would never come back--never; and you
taunted me, and said what a simpleton I was to expect him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! ... And
at last I believed you and gave way! ... And then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came back!
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is gone. Gone a second time, and I have lost him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now
for ever ... and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will not love me the littlest bit ever any
more--only hate me! ... O yes, I have lost him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now--again because
of--you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Brooks</b></font>)</div>In writhing, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) head on the chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>)
face towards the door, and Mrs Brooks could see the pain upon it,
and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) lips were bleeding from the clench of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) teeth upon
them, and that the long lashes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) closed eyes stuck in wet tags
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) cheeks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is dying--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
is dying! ... And my sin will kill him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and not kill me! ... O, you
have torn my life all to pieces ... made me be what I prayed you in
pity not to make me be again! ... My own true husband will never,
never--O God--I can't bear this!--I cannot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>There were more and sharper words from the man; then a sudden rustle;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) had sprung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) feet. Mrs Brooks, thinking that the speaker
was coming to rush out of the door, hastily retreated down the
stairs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) need not have done so, however, for the door of the sitting-room
was not opened. But Mrs Brooks felt it unsafe to watch on the
landing again, and entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) own parlour below.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) could hear nothing through the floor, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) listened
intently, and thereupon went to the kitchen to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) interrupted
breakfast. Coming up presently to the front room on the ground floor
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) took up some sewing, waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) lodgers to ring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>)
might take away the breakfast, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) meant to do herself, to
discover what was the matter if possible. Overhead, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) sat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>)
could now hear the floorboards slightly creak, as if some one were
walking about, and presently the movement was explained by the rustle
of garments against the banisters, the opening and the closing of
the front door, and the form of Tess passing to the gate on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) way
into the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was fully dressed now in the walking costume
of a well-to-do young lady in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had arrived, with the sole
addition that over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hat and black feathers a veil was drawn.

<p/>Mrs Brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell, temporary
or otherwise, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) tenants at the door above. They might have
quarrelled, or Mr d``Urberville might still be asleep, for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was not
an early riser.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went into the back room, which was more especially her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own
apartment, and continued her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sewing there. The lady lodger did not
return, nor did the gentleman ring his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bell. Mrs Brooks pondered on
the delay, and on what probable relation the visitor who had called
so early bore to the couple upstairs. In reflecting she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) leant back
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) chair.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) did so her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) eyes glanced casually over the ceiling till they
were arrested by a spot in the middle of its white surface which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>)
had never noticed there before. It was about the size of a wafer
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) first observed it, but it speedily grew as large as the palm
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) hand, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) could perceive that it was red. The oblong
white ceiling, with this scarlet blot in the midst, had the
appearance of a gigantic ace of hearts.

<p/>Mrs Brooks had strange qualms of misgiving. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) got upon the table,
and touched the spot in the ceiling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) fingers. It was damp,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) fancied that it was a blood stain.

<p/>Descending from the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) left the parlour, and went upstairs,
intending to enter the room overhead, which was the bedchamber at
the back of the drawing-room. But, nerveless woman as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had now
become, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not bring herself to attempt the handle. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
listened. The dead silence within was broken only by a regular beat.

<p/>Drip, drip, drip.

<p/>Mrs Brooks hastened downstairs, opened the front door, and ran into
the street. A man she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) knew, one of the workmen employed at an
adjoining villa, was passing by, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to come in and go
upstairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) feared something had happened to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>)
lodgers. The workman assented, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) to the landing.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) opened the door of the drawing-room, and stood back for him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)
to pass in, entering herself behind him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>). The room was empty; the
breakfast--a substantial repast of coffee, eggs, and a cold ham--lay
spread upon the table untouched, as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) had taken it up,
excepting that the carving-knife was missing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooks</b></font>) asked the man to
go through the folding-doors into the adjoining room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened the doors, entered a step or two, and came back almost
instantly with a rigid face. <div class="bookquote">``My good God, the gentleman in bed is
dead! I think he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has been hurt with a knife--a lot of blood had run
down upon the floor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the tramp</b></font>)</div><p/>The alarm was soon given, and the house which had lately been so
quiet resounded with the tramp of many footsteps, a surgeon among the
rest. The wound was small, but the point of the blade had touched
the heart of the victim, who lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) back, pale, fixed, dead, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow. In a
quarter of an hour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary
visitor to the town had been stabbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bed, spread through every
street and villa of the popular watering-place.



<p/>LVII


<p/>Meanwhile Angel Clare had walked automatically along the way by which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had come, and, entering his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hotel, sat down over the breakfast,
staring at nothingness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went on eating and drinking unconsciously
till on a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) demanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) bill; having paid which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
dressing-bag in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hand, the only luggage he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>),
and went out.

<p/>At the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) departure a telegram was handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)--a few
words from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother, stating that they were glad to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
address, and informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) brother Cuthbert had proposed to
and been accepted by Mercy Chant.

<p/>Clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station;
reaching it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) found that there would be no train leaving for an
hour and more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sat down to wait, and having waited a quarter of
an hour felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could wait there no longer. Broken in heart and
numbed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had nothing to hurry for; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wished to get out of a
town which had been the scene of such an experience, and turned to
walk to the first station onward, and let the train pick him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) up
there.

<p/>The highway that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) followed was open, and at a little distance
dipped into a valley, across which it could be seen running from edge
to edge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had traversed the greater part of this depression, and
was climbing the western acclivity when, pausing for breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
unconsciously looked back. Why he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not say, but
something seemed to impel him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to the act. The tape-like surface of
the road diminished in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) rear as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could see, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
gazed a moving spot intruded on the white vacuity of its perspective.

<p/>It was a human figure running. Clare waited, with a dim sense that
somebody was trying to overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>The form descending the incline was a woman's, yet so entirely was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mind blinded to the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) wife's following him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) that even
when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came nearer he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) under the totally
changed attire in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) now beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). It was not till she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
quite close that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could believe her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you--turn away from the station--just before I got there--and
I have been following you all this way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was so pale, so breathless, so quivering in every muscle, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
did not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) a single question, but seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) hand, and pulling
it within his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) along. To avoid meeting any possible
wayfarers he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) left the high road and took a footpath under some
fir-trees. When they were deep among the moaning boughs he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) stopped
and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) inquiringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, as if waiting for this, <div class="bookquote">``do you know what I have
been running after you for? To tell you that I have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A pitiful white smile lit her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), thinking from the strangeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) manner that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
was in some delirium.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done it--I don't know how,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``Still, I owed it
to you, and to myself, Angel. I feared long ago, when I struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
on the mouth with my glove, that I might do it some day for the trap
he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) set for me in my simple youth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) wrong to you through me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) has come between us and ruined us, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) can never do it any
more. I never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) at all, Angel, as I loved you. You know it,
don't you? You believe it? You didn't come back to me, and I was
obliged to go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). Why did you go away--why did you--when I
loved you so? I can't think why you did it. But I don't blame you;
only, Angel, will you forgive me my sin against you, now I have
killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)? I thought as I ran along that you would be sure to
forgive me now I have done that. It came to me as a shining light
that I should get you back that way. I could not bear the loss of
you any longer--you don't know how entirely I was unable to bear your
not loving me! Say you do now, dear, dear husband; say you do, now I
have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do love you, Tess--O, I do--it is all come back!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said,
tightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) with fervid pressure. <div class="bookquote">``But how do you
mean--you have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured in a reverie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, bodily? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heard me crying about you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bitterly taunted me; and
called you by a foul name; and then I did it. My heart could not
bear it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had nagged me about you before. And then I dressed
myself and came away to find you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was inclined to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had faintly attempted,
at least, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had done; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) horror at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) impulse
was mixed with amazement at the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) affection for
himself, and at the strangeness of its quality, which had apparently
extinguished her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) moral sense altogether. Unable to realize the
gravity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) conduct, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) seemed at last content; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) looked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) lay upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) shoulder, weeping with happiness, and
wondered what obscure strain in the d``Urberville blood had led to
this aberration--if it were an aberration. There momentarily flashed
through his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind that the family tradition of the coach and murder
might have arisen because the d``Urbervilles had been known to do
these things. As well as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) confused and excited ideas could
reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) supposed that in the moment of mad grief of which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
spoke, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind had lost its balance, and plunged her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) into this
abyss.

<p/>It was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad. But,
anyhow, here was this deserted wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), this passionately-fond
woman, clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) without a suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would be anything
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) but a protector. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw that for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be otherwise was
not, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind, within the region of the possible. Tenderness was
absolutely dominant in Clare at last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) endlessly with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) white lips, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not desert you! I will protect you by every means in my
power, dearest love, whatever you may have done or not have done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>They then walked on under the trees, Tess turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) head every now
and then to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). Worn and unhandsome as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had become, it
was plain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) did not discern the least fault in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) appearance.
To her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was, as of old, all that was perfection, personally and
mentally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was still her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) Antinous, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) Apollo even; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sickly
face was beautiful as the morning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) affectionate regard on
this day no less than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) first beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); for was it not the
face of the one man on earth who had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) purely, and who had
believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) as pure!

<p/>With an instinct as to possibilities, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
intended, make for the first station beyond the town, but plunged
still farther under the firs, which here abounded for miles. Each
clasping the other round the waist they promenaded over the dry bed
of fir-needles, thrown into a vague intoxicating atmosphere at the
consciousness of being together at last, with no living soul between
them; ignoring that there was a corpse. Thus they proceeded for
several miles till Tess, arousing herself, looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and
said, timidly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we going anywhere in particular?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, dearest. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we might walk a few miles further, and when it is evening find
lodgings somewhere or other--in a lonely cottage, perhaps. Can you
walk well, Tessy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes! I could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon the whole it seemed a good thing to do. Thereupon they
quickened their pace, avoiding high roads, and following obscure
paths tending more or less northward. But there was an unpractical
vagueness in their movements throughout the day; neither one of them
seemed to consider any question of effectual escape, disguise, or
long concealment. Their every idea was temporary and unforefending,
like the plans of two children.

<p/>At mid-day they drew near to a roadside inn, and Tess would have
entered it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to get something to eat, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) persuaded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to remain among the trees and bushes of this half-woodland,
half-moorland part of the country till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) should come back. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
clothes were of recent fashion; even the ivory-handled parasol that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) carried was of a shape unknown in the retired spot to which they
had now wandered; and the cut of such articles would have attracted
attention in the settle of a tavern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) soon returned, with food
enough for half-a-dozen people and two bottles of wine--enough to
last them for a day or more, should any emergency arise.

<p/>They sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal. Between
one and two o'clock they packed up the remainder and went on again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel strong enough to walk any distance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior
of the country, where we can hide for a time, and are less likely to
be looked for than anywhere near the coast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>Clare remarked. <div class="bookquote">``Later
on, when they have forgotten us, we can make for some port.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) more tightly,
and straight inland they went. Though the season was an English May,
the weather was serenely bright, and during the afternoon it was
quite warm. Through the latter miles of their walk their footpath
had taken them into the depths of the New Forest, and towards
evening, turning the corner of a lane, they perceived behind a brook
and bridge a large board on which was painted in white letters, <div class="bookquote">``This
desirable Mansion to be Let Furnished'' (<font color='red'><b>some London agents</b></font>)</div>; particulars following, with
directions to apply to some London agents. Passing through the gate
they could see the house, an old brick building of regular design and
large accommodation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare. <div class="bookquote">``It is Bramshurst Court. You can see that
it is shut up, and grass is growing on the drive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of the windows are open,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div>said Tess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just to air the rooms, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All these rooms empty, and we without a roof to our heads!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are getting tired, my Tess!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We'll stop soon.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sad mouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) again led her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) onwards.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was growing weary likewise, for they had wandered a dozen or
fifteen miles, and it became necessary to consider what they should
do for rest. They looked from afar at isolated cottages and little
inns, and were inclined to approach one of the latter, when their
hearts failed them, and they sheered off. At length their gait
dragged, and they stood still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could we sleep under the trees?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thought the season insufficiently advanced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Let us go back towards it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They retraced their steps, but it was half an hour before they stood
without the entrance-gate as earlier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) then requested her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to stay
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) was, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) went to see who was within.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) sat down among the bushes within the gate, and Clare crept
towards the house. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) absence lasted some considerable time, and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) returned Tess was wildly anxious, not for herself, but for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in
charge as caretaker, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only came there on fine days, from the
hamlet near, to open and shut the windows. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would come to shut
them at sunset. <div class="bookquote">``Now, we can get in through one of the lower
windows, and rest there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>).

<p/>Under his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) escort she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went tardily forward to the main front, whose
shuttered windows, like sightless eyeballs, excluded the possibility
of watchers. The door was reached a few steps further, and one of
the windows beside it was open. Clare clambered in, and pulled Tess
in after him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/>Except the hall, the rooms were all in darkness, and they ascended
the staircase. Up here also the shutters were tightly closed,
the ventilation being perfunctorily done, for this day at least,
by opening the hall-window in front and an upper window behind.
Clare unlatched the door of a large chamber, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) way across
it, and parted the shutters to the width of two or three inches.
A shaft of dazzling sunlight glanced into the room, revealing heavy,
old-fashioned furniture, crimson damask hangings, and an enormous
four-post bedstead, along the head of which were carved running
figures, apparently Atalanta's race.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rest at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), setting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) bag and the parcel of
viands.

<p/>They remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come
to shut the windows: as a precaution, putting themselves in total
darkness by barring the shutters as before, lest the woman should
open the door of their chamber for any casual reason. Between six
and seven o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came, but did not approach the wing they
were in. They heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) close the windows, fasten them, lock the
door, and go away. Then Clare again stole a chink of light from
the window, and they shared another meal, till by-and-by they
were enveloped in the shades of night which they had no candle to
disperse.



<p/>LVIII


<p/>The night was strangely solemn and still. In the small hours she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) the whole story of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had walked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sleep
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arms across the Froom stream, at the imminent risk of
both their lives, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) down in the stone coffin at the ruined
abbey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had never known of that till now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell me next day?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It might have prevented
much misunderstanding and woe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think of what's past!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am not going to think
outside of now. Why should we! Who knows what to-morrow has in
store?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it apparently had no sorrow. The morning was wet and foggy, and
Clare, rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows
on fine days, ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the
house, leaving Tess asleep. There was no food on the premises, but
there was water, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) took advantage of the fog to emerge from the
mansion and fetch tea, bread, and butter from a shop in a little
place two miles beyond, as also a small tin kettle and spirit-lamp,
that they might get fire without smoke. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) re-entry awoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>); and
they breakfasted on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had brought.

<p/>They were indisposed to stir abroad, and the day passed, and the
night following, and the next, and next; till, almost without their
being aware, five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion, not a
sight or sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness, such
as it was. The changes of the weather were their only events, the
birds of the New Forest their only company. By tacit consent they
hardly once spoke of any incident of the past subsequent to their
wedding-day. The gloomy intervening time seemed to sink into chaos,
over which the present and prior times closed as if it never had
been. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) suggested that they should leave their shelter,
and go forwards towards Southampton or London, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) showed a strange
unwillingness to move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should we put an end to all that's sweet and lovely!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
deprecated. <div class="bookquote">``What must come will come.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And, looking through the
shutter-chink: <div class="bookquote">``All is trouble outside there; inside here content.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) peeped out also. It was quite true; within was affection, union,
error forgiven: outside was the inexorable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And--and,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I fear that
what you think of me now may not last. I do not wish to outlive your
present feeling for me. I would rather not. I would rather be dead
and buried when the time comes for you to despise me, so that it may
never be known to me that you despised me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot ever despise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I also hope that. But considering what my life has been, I cannot
see why any man should, sooner or later, be able to help despising
me... How wickedly mad I was! Yet formerly I never could bear to
hurt a fly or a worm, and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to
make me cry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They remained yet another day. In the night the dull sky cleared,
and the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early.
The brilliant sunrise made her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) unusually brisk; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) decided to open
the contiguous mansion immediately, and to air it thoroughly on such
a day. Thus it occurred that, having arrived and opened the lower
rooms before six o'clock, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ascended to the bedchambers, and was
about to turn the handle of the one wherein they lay. At that moment
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could hear the breathing of persons within. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
slippers and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) antiquity had rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) progress a noiseless one
so far, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) made for instant retreat; then, deeming that her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
hearing might have deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) turned anew to the door and
softly tried the handle. The lock was out of order, but a piece of
furniture had been moved forward on the inside, which prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
opening the door more than an inch or two. A stream of morning light
through the shutter-chink fell upon the faces of the pair, wrapped in
profound slumber, Tess's lips being parted like a half-opened flower
near his (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) cheek. The caretaker was so struck with their innocent
appearance, and with the elegance of Tess's gown hanging across a
chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) silk stockings beside it, the pretty parasol, and the
other habits in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had arrived because she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had none else, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave
way to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement, as it
seemed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) closed the door, and withdrew as softly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) had come,
to go and consult with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) neighbours on the odd discovery.

<p/>Not more than a minute had elapsed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) withdrawal when Tess
woke, and then Clare. Both had a sense that something had disturbed
them, though they could not say what; and the uneasy feeling which
it engendered grew stronger. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was dressed he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) narrowly
scanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we will leave at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is a fine day. And I
cannot help fancying somebody is about the house. At any rate, the
woman will be sure to come to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) passively assented, and putting the room in order, they took up
the few articles that belonged to them, and departed noiselessly.
When they had got into the Forest she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) turned to take a last look at
the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, happy house--goodbye!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My life can only be a
question of a few weeks. Why should we not have stayed there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say it, Tess! We shall soon get out of this district
altogether. We'll continue our course as we've begun it, and keep
straight north. Nobody will think of looking for us there. We shall
be looked for at the Wessex ports if we are sought at all. When we
are in the north we will get to a port and away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Having thus persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), the plan was pursued, and they kept a
bee-line northward. Their long repose at the manor-house lent them
walking power now; and towards mid-day they found that they were
approaching the steepled city of Melchester, which lay directly in
their way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) decided to rest her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) in a clump of trees during the
afternoon, and push onward under cover of darkness. At dusk Clare
purchased food as usual, and their night march began, the boundary
between Upper and Mid-Wessex being crossed about eight o'clock.

<p/>To walk across country without much regard to roads was not new
to Tess, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) old agility in the performance. The
intercepting city, ancient Melchester, they were obliged to pass
through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a
large river that obstructed them. It was about midnight when they
went along the deserted streets, lighted fitfully by the few lamps,
keeping off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps.
The graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left
hand, but it was lost upon them now. Once out of the town they
followed the turnpike-road, which after a few miles plunged across an
open plain.

<p/>Though the sky was dense with cloud, a diffused light from some
fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little. But the moon
had now sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and
the night grew as dark as a cave. However, they found their way
along, keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might
not resound, which it was easy to do, there being no hedge or fence
of any kind. All around was open loneliness and black solitude, over
which a stiff breeze blew.

<p/>They had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when
on a sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) front, rising sheer from the grass. They had almost struck
themselves against it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What monstrous place is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Angel</b></font>)</div>said Angel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It hums,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Hearken!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) listened. The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming
tune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed harp. No other
sound came from it, and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) hand and advancing a step or
two, Clare felt the vertical surface of the structure. It seemed to
be of solid stone, without joint or moulding. Carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fingers
onward he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) found that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had come in contact with was a colossal
rectangular pillar; by stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) left hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could feel a
similar one adjoining. At an indefinite height overhead something
made the black sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast
architrave uniting the pillars horizontally. They carefully entered
beneath and between; the surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they
seemed to be still out of doors. The place was roofless. Tess drew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) breath fearfully, and Angel, perplexed, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Feeling sideways they encountered another tower-like pillar, square
and uncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another. The
place was all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous
architraves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very Temple of the Winds,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) said.

<p/>The next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others
were prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a
carriage; and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of
monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain. The couple
advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in
its midst.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Stonehenge!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div>said Clare.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The heathen temple, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes. Older than the centuries; older than the d<div class="bookquote">``Urbervilles! Well,
what shall we do, darling? We may find shelter further on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tess/Tess Durbeyfield/Durbeyfield</b></font>)</div><p/>But Tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong
slab that lay close at hand, and was sheltered from the wind by a
pillar. Owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the
stone was warm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and chill
grass around, which had damped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) skirts and shoes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go any further, Angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
hand for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Can't we bide here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear not. This spot is visible for miles by day, although it does
not seem so now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of my mother's people was a shepherd hereabouts, now I think of
it. And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen. So now
I am at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knelt down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) outstretched form, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lips upon
hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sleepy are you, dear? I think you are lying on an altar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like very much to be here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``It is so solemn and
lonely--after my great happiness--with nothing but the sky above my
face. It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two;
and I wish there were not--except `Liza-Lu.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/Mr Clare/Angel</b></font>)</div><p/>Clare though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) might as well rest here till it should get a little
lighter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) overcoat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), and sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>)
side.

<p/>``Angel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over <div class="bookquote">``Liza-Lu for
my sake?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) asked, when they had listened a long time to the wind
among the pillars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is so good and simple and pure. O, Angel--I wish you would
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) if you lose me, as you will do shortly. O, if you would!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I lose you I lose all! And she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is my sister-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That's nothing, dearest. People marry sister-laws continually about
Marlott; and <div class="bookquote">``Liza-Lu is so gentle and sweet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is growing
so beautiful. O, I could share you with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) willingly when we are
spirits! If you would train her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) and teach her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), Angel, and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
up for your own self! ... She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had all the best of me without the bad
of me; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) were to become yours it would almost seem as if
death had not divided us... Well, I have said it. I won't mention
it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) ceased, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) fell into thought. In the far north-east sky he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)
could see between the pillars a level streak of light. The uniform
concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot,
letting in at the earth's edge the coming day, against which the
towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did they sacrifice to God here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe to the sun. That lofty stone set away by itself is in the
direction of the sun, which will presently rise behind it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This reminds me, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You remember you never would
interfere with any belief of mine before we were married? But I knew
your mind all the same, and I thought as you thought--not from any
reasons of my own, but because you thought so. Tell me now, Angel,
do you think we shall meet again after we are dead? I want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) to avoid a reply at such a time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Angel--I fear that means no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), with a suppressed sob.
<div class="bookquote">``And I wanted so to see you again--so much, so much! What--not even
you and I, Angel, who love each other so well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Like a greater than himself, to the critical question at the critical
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not answer; and they were again silent. In a minute or
two her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) breathing became more regular, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) clasp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hand relaxed,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>) fell asleep. The band of silver paleness along the east
horizon made even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark
and near; and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of
reserve, taciturnity, and hesitation which is usual just before day.
The eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against
the light, and the great flame-shaped Sun-stone beyond them; and the
Stone of Sacrifice midway. Presently the night wind died out, and
the quivering little pools in the cup-like hollows of the stones lay
still. At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the
dip eastward--a mere dot. It was the head of a man approaching them
from the hollow beyond the Sun-stone. Clare wished they had gone
onward, but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet. The figure
came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) heard something behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), the brush of feet. Turning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) saw
over the prostrate columns another figure; then before he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was aware,
another was at hand on the right, under a trilithon, and another on
the left. The dawn shone full on the front of the man westward, and
Clare could discern from this that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was tall, and walked as if
trained. They all closed in with evident purpose. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) story then
was true! Springing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) looked around for a weapon,
loose stone, means of escape, anything. By this time the nearest
man was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no use, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There are sixteen of us on the Plain,
and the whole country is reared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) sleep!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) implored in a whisper of the men as
they gathered round.

<p/>When they saw where she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lay, which they had not done till then, they
showed no objection, and stood watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), as still as the pillars
around. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to the stone and bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), holding one poor
little hand; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) breathing now was quick and small, like that of a
lesser creature than a woman. All waited in the growing light, their
faces and hands as if they were silvered, the remainder of their
figures dark, the stones glistening green-gray, the Plain still a
mass of shade. Soon the light was strong, and a ray shone upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
unconscious form, peering under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyelids and waking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Angel?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, starting up. <div class="bookquote">``Have they come for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as it should be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Angel, I am almost glad--yes,
glad! This happiness could not have lasted. It was too much. I
have had enough; and now I shall not live for you to despise me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood up, shook herself, and went forward, neither of the men
having moved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said quietly.



<p/>LIX


<p/>The city of Wintoncester, that fine old city, aforetime capital
of Wessex, lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the
brightness and warmth of a July morning. The gabled brick, tile, and
freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument
of lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in the sloping
High Street, from the West Gateway to the mediæval cross, and from
the mediæval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping
was in progress which usually ushers in an old-fashioned market-day.

<p/>From the western gate aforesaid the highway, as every Wintoncestrian
knows, ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a
measured mile, leaving the houses gradually behind. Up this road
from the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly,
as if unconscious of the trying ascent--unconscious through
preoccupation and not through buoyancy. They had emerged upon this
road through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower
down. They seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and
of their kind, and this road appeared to offer the quickest means
of doing so. Though they were young, they walked with bowed heads,
which gait of grief the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly.

<p/>One of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding
creature--half girl, half woman--a spiritualized image of Tess,
slighter than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tess</b></font>), but with the same beautiful eyes--Clare's
sister-in-law, ``Liza-Lu. Their pale faces seemed to have shrunk
to half their natural size. They moved on hand in hand, and never
spoke a word, the drooping of their heads being that of Giotto's
<div class="bookquote">``Two Apostles'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>When they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill the
clocks in the town struck eight. Each gave a start at the notes,
and, walking onward yet a few steps, they reached the first
milestone, standing whitely on the green margin of the grass, and
backed by the down, which here was open to the road. They entered
upon the turf, and, impelled by a force that seemed to overrule their
will, suddenly stood still, turned, and waited in paralyzed suspense
beside the stone.

<p/>The prospect from this summit was almost unlimited. In the valley
beneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings
showing as in an isometric drawing--among them the broad cathedral
tower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave,
the spires of St Thomas's, the pinnacled tower of the College, and,
more to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice,
where to this day the pilgrim may receive his (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) dole of bread and ale.
Behind the city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine's Hill;
further off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost
in the radiance of the sun hanging above it.

<p/>Against these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other
city edifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs,
and rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole
contrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities
of the Gothic erections. It was somewhat disguised from the road in
passing it by yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up
here. The wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the
wall of this structure. From the middle of the building an ugly
flat-topped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and
viewed from this spot, on its shady side and against the light, it
seemed the one blot on the city's beauty. Yet it was with this blot,
and not with the beauty, that the two gazers were concerned.

<p/>Upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed. Their eyes
were riveted on it. A few minutes after the hour had struck
something moved slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the
breeze. It was a black flag.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Justice''  (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div>was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean
phrase, had ended his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) sport with Tess. And the d``Urberville knights
and dames slept on in their tombs unknowing. The two speechless
gazers bent themselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and
remained thus a long time, absolutely motionless: the flag continued
to wave silently. As soon as they had strength, they arose, joined
hands again, and went on.

<div class="bookquote">``Defects,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations. To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.net

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
