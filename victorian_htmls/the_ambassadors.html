<p/>The Ambassadors,

<p/>New York Edition -LRB-1909-RRB-.




<p/>Volume I



<p/>Preface


<p/>Nothing is more easy than to state the subject of <div class="bookquote">``The Ambassadors,''
 (<font color='red'><b>North American Review</b></font>)</div>which first appeared in twelve numbers of _The North American Review_
-LRB-1903-RRB- and was published as a whole the same year. The situation
involved is gathered up betimes, that is in the second chapter of Book
Fifth, for the reader's benefit, into as few words as possible--planted
or <div class="bookquote">``sunk,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>stiffly and saliently, in the centre of the current, almost
perhaps to the obstruction of traffic. Never can a composition of this
sort have sprung straighter from a dropped grain of suggestion, and
never can that grain, developed, overgrown and smothered, have yet
lurked more in the mass as an independent particle. The whole case, in
fine, is in Lambert Strether's irrepressible outbreak to little Bilham
on the Sunday afternoon in Gloriani's garden, the candour with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
yields, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) young friend's enlightenment, to the charming
admonition of that crisis. The idea of the tale resides indeed in the
very fact that an hour of such unprecedented ease should have been felt
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) AS a crisis, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) is at pains to express it for us as neatly
as we could desire. The remarks to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thus gives utterance
contain the essence of <div class="bookquote">``The Ambassadors,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fingers close, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
has done, round the stem of the full-blown flower; which, after that
fashion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continues officiously to present to us. <div class="bookquote">``Live all you can;
it's a mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter what you do in
particular so long as you have your life. If you haven't had that what
HAVE you had? I'm too old--too old at any rate for what I see. What
one loses one loses; make no mistake about that. Still, we have the
illusion of freedom; therefore don't, like me to-day, be without the
memory of that illusion. I was either, at the right time, too stupid or
too intelligent to have it, and now I'm a case of reaction against the
mistake. Do what you like so long as you don't make it. For it WAS a
mistake. Live, live!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gist</b></font>)</div>Such is the gist of Strether's appeal to the
impressed youth, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) likes and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) desires to befriend; the
word <div class="bookquote">``mistake''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>occurs several times, it will be seen, in the course of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) remarks--which gives the measure of the signal warning he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feels
attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) has accordingly missed too much, though
perhaps after all constitutionally qualified for a better part, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
wakes up to it in conditions that press the spring of a terrible
question. WOULD there yet perhaps be time for reparation?--reparation,
that is, for the injury done his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) character; for the affront, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) is
quite ready to say, so stupidly put upon it and in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) has even
himself had so clumsy a hand? The answer to which is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now at
all events SEES; so that the business of my tale and the march of my
action, not to say the precious moral of everything, is just my
demonstration of this process of vision.

<p/>Nothing can exceed the closeness with which the whole fits again into
its germ. That had been given me bodily, as usual, by the spoken word,
for I was to take the image over exactly as I happened to have met it.
A friend had repeated to me, with great appreciation, a thing or two
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) by a man of distinction, much his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) senior, and to which a
sense akin to that of Strether's melancholy eloquence might be
imputed--said as chance would have, and so easily might, in Paris, and
in a charming old garden attached to a house of art, and on a Sunday
afternoon of summer, many persons of great interest being present. The
observation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the
<div class="bookquote">``note''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that I was to recognise on the spot as to my purpose--had
contained in fact the greater part; the rest was in the place and the
time and the scene they sketched: these constituents clustered and
combined to give me further support, to give me what I may call the
note absolute. There it stands, accordingly, full in the tideway;
driven in, with hard taps, like some strong stake for the noose of a
cable, the swirl of the current roundabout it. What amplified the hint
to more than the bulk of hints in general was the gift with it of the
old Paris garden, for in that token were sealed up values infinitely
precious. There was of course the seal to break and each item of the
packet to count over and handle and estimate; but somehow, in the light
of the hint, all the elements of a situation of the sort most to my
taste were there. I could even remember no occasion on which, so
confronted, I had found it of a livelier interest to take stock, in
this fashion, of suggested wealth. For I think, verily, that there are
degrees of merit in subjects--in spite of the fact that to treat even
one of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time, for
the feverish and prejudiced hour, at least figure its merit and its
dignity as POSSIBLY absolute. What it comes to, doubtless, is that
even among the supremely good--since with such alone is it one's theory
of one's honour to be concerned--there is an ideal BEAUTY of goodness
the invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its
maximum. Then truly, I hold, one's theme may be said to shine, and
that of <div class="bookquote">``The Ambassadors,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confess, wore this glow for me from
beginning to end. Fortunately thus I am able to estimate this as,
frankly, quite the best, <div class="bookquote">``all round,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>of all my productions; any
failure of that justification would have made such an extreme of
complacency publicly fatuous.

<p/>I recall then in this connexion no moment of subjective intermittence,
never one of those alarms as for a suspected hollow beneath one's feet,
a felt ingratitude in the scheme adopted, under which confidence fails
and opportunity seems but to mock. If the motive of <div class="bookquote">``The Wings of the
Dove,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as I have noted, was to worry me at moments by a sealing-up of
its face--though without prejudice to its again, of a sudden, fairly
grimacing with expression--so in this other business I had absolute
conviction and constant clearness to deal with; it had been a frank
proposition, the whole bunch of data, installed on my premises like a
monotony of fine weather. -LRB-The order of composition, in these things,
I may mention, was reversed by the order of publication; the earlier
written of the two books having appeared as the later.-RRB- Even under the
weight of my hero's years I could feel my postulate firm; even under
the strain of the difference between those of Madame de Vionnet and
those of Chad Newsome, a difference liable to be denounced as shocking,
I could still feel it serene. Nothing resisted, nothing betrayed, I
seem to make out, in this full and sound sense of the matter; it shed
from any side I could turn it to the same golden glow. I rejoiced in
the promise of a hero so mature, who would give me thereby the more to
bite into--since it's only into thickened motive and accumulated
character, I think, that the painter of life bites more than a little.
My poor friend should have accumulated character, certainly; or rather
would be quite naturally and handsomely possessed of it, in the sense
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would have, and would always have felt he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had, imagination
galore, and that this yet wouldn't have wrecked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). It was
immeasurable, the opportunity to <div class="bookquote">``do''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>a man of imagination, for if
THERE mightn't be a chance to <div class="bookquote">``bite,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>where in the world might it be?
This personage of course, so enriched, wouldn't give me, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) type,
imagination in PREDOMINANCE or as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prime faculty, nor should I, in
view of other matters, have found that convenient. So particular a
luxury--some occasion, that is, for study of the high gift in SUPREME
command of a case or of a career--would still doubtless come on the day
I should be ready to pay for it; and till then might, as from far back,
remain hung up well in view and just out of reach. The comparative case
meanwhile would serve--it was only on the minor scale that I had
treated myself even to comparative cases.

<p/>I was to hasten to add however that, happy stopgaps as the minor scale
had thus yielded, the instance in hand should enjoy the advantage of
the full range of the major; since most immediately to the point was
the question of that SUPPLEMENT of situation logically involved in our
gentleman's impulse to deliver himself in the Paris garden on the
Sunday afternoon--or if not involved by strict logic then all ideally
and enchantingly implied in it. -LRB-I say <div class="bookquote">``ideally,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>because I need
scarce mention that for development, for expression of its maximum, my
glimmering story was, at the earliest stage, to have nipped the thread
of connexion with the possibilities of the actual reported speaker. HE (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
remains but the happiest of accidents; his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) actualities, all too
definite, precluded any range of possibilities; it had only been his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
charming office to project upon that wide field of the artist's
vision--which hangs there ever in place like the white sheet suspended
for the figures of a child's magic-lantern--a more fantastic and more
moveable shadow.-RRB- No privilege of the teller of tales and the handler
of puppets is more delightful, or has more of the suspense and the
thrill of a game of difficulty breathlessly played, than just this
business of looking for the unseen and the occult, in a scheme
half-grasped, by the light or, so to speak, by the clinging scent, of
the gage already in hand. No dreadful old pursuit of the hidden slave
with bloodhounds and the rag of association can ever, for <div class="bookquote">``excitement,''
 (<font color='red'><b>bloodhounds</b></font>)</div>I judge, have bettered it at its best. For the dramatist always, by
the very law of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) genius, believes not only in a possible right issue
from the rightly-conceived tight place; he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) does much more than this--he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
believes, irresistibly, in the necessary, the precious <div class="bookquote">``tightness''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of
the place -LRB-whatever the issue-RRB- on the strength of any respectable hint.
It being thus the respectable hint that I had with such avidity picked
up, what would be the story to which it would most inevitably form the
centre? It is part of the charm attendant on such questions that the
<div class="bookquote">``story,''  (<font color='red'><b>the charm attendant</b></font>)</div>with the omens true, as I say, puts on from this stage the
authenticity of concrete existence. It then is, essentially--it begins
to be, though it may more or less obscurely lurk, so that the point is
not in the least what to make of it, but only, very delightfully and
very damnably, where to put one's hand on it.

<p/>In which truth resides surely much of the interest of that admirable
mixture for salutary application which we know as art. Art deals with
what we see, it must first contribute full-handed that ingredient; it
plucks its material, otherwise expressed, in the garden of life--which
material elsewhere grown is stale and uneatable. But it has no sooner
done this than it has to take account of a PROCESS--from which only
when it's the basest of the servants of man, incurring ignominious
dismissal with no <div class="bookquote">``character,''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>does it, and whether under some muddled
pretext of morality or on any other, pusillanimously edge away. The
process, that of the expression, the literal squeezing-out, of value is
another affair--with which the happy luck of mere finding has little to
do. The joys of finding, at this stage, are pretty well over; that
quest of the subject as a whole by <div class="bookquote">``matching,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>as the ladies say at the
shops, the big piece with the snippet, having ended, we assume, with a
capture. The subject is found, and if the problem is then transferred
to the ground of what to do with it the field opens out for any amount
of doing. This is precisely the infusion that, as I submit, completes
the strong mixture. It is on the other hand the part of the business
that can least be likened to the chase with horn and hound. It's all a
sedentary part--involves as much ciphering, of sorts, as would merit
the highest salary paid to a chief accountant. Not, however, that the
chief accountant hasn't HIS (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) gleams of bliss; for the felicity, or at
least the equilibrium of the artist's state dwells less, surely, in the
further delightful complications he (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) can smuggle in than in those he (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>)
succeeds in keeping out. He (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) sows his (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) seed at the risk of too thick a
crop; wherefore yet again, like the gentlemen who audit ledgers, he (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>)
must keep his (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) head at any price. In consequence of all which, for the
interest of the matter, I might seem here to have my choice of
narrating my <div class="bookquote">``hunt''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>for Lambert Strether, of describing the capture of
the shadow projected by my friend's anecdote, or of reporting on the
occurrences subsequent to that triumph. But I had probably best
attempt a little to glance in each direction; since it comes to me
again and again, over this licentious record, that one's bag of
adventures, conceived or conceivable, has been only half-emptied by the
mere telling of one's story. It depends so on what one means by that
equivocal quantity. There is the story of one's hero, and then, thanks
to the intimate connexion of things, the story of one's story itself. I
blush to confess it, but if one's a dramatist one's a dramatist, and
the latter imbroglio is liable on occasion to strike me as really the
more objective of the two.

<p/>The philosophy imputed to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) in that beautiful outbreak, the hour
there, amid such happy provision, striking for him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), would have been
then, on behalf of my man of imagination, to be logically and, as the
artless craft of comedy has it, <div class="bookquote">``led up''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>to; the probable course to
such a goal, the goal of so conscious a predicament, would have in
short to be finely calculated. Where has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come from and why has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
come, what is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doing -LRB-as we Anglo-Saxons, and we only, say, in our
foredoomed clutch of exotic aids to expression-RRB- in that galere? To
answer these questions plausibly, to answer them as under
cross-examination in the witness-box by counsel for the prosecution, in
other words satisfactorily to account for Strether and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``peculiar tone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>was to possess myself of the entire fabric. At the
same time the clue to its whereabouts would lie in a certain principle
of probability: he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't have indulged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) peculiar tone without
a reason; it would take a felt predicament or a false position to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) so ironic an accent. One hadn't been noting <div class="bookquote">``tones''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>all one's life
without recognising when one heard it the voice of the false position.
The dear man in the Paris garden was then admirably and unmistakeably
IN one--which was no small point gained; what next accordingly
concerned us was the determination of THIS identity. One could only go
by probabilities, but there was the advantage that the most general of
the probabilities were virtual certainties. Possessed of our friend's
nationality, to start with, there was a general probability in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
narrower localism; which, for that matter, one had really but to keep
under the lens for an hour to see it give up its secrets. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would
have issued, our rueful worthy, from the very heart of New England--at
the heels of which matter of course a perfect train of secrets tumbled
for me into the light. They had to be sifted and sorted, and I shall
not reproduce the detail of that process; but unmistakeably they were
all there, and it was but a question, auspiciously, of picking among
them. What the <div class="bookquote">``position''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>would infallibly be, and why, on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands,
it had turned <div class="bookquote">``false'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--these inductive steps could only be as rapid as
they were distinct. I accounted for everything--and <div class="bookquote">``everything''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>had
by this time become the most promising quantity--by the view that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had come to Paris in some state of mind which was literally undergoing,
as a result of new and unexpected assaults and infusions, a change
almost from hour to hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had come with a view that might have been
figured by a clear green liquid, say, in a neat glass phial; and the
liquid, once poured into the open cup of APPLICATION, once exposed to
the action of another air, had begun to turn from green to red, or
whatever, and might, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew, be on its way to purple, to
black, to yellow. At the still wilder extremes represented perhaps,
for all he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could say to the contrary, by a variability so violent, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
would at first, naturally, but have gazed in surprise and alarm;
whereby the SITUATION clearly would spring from the play of wildness
and the development of extremes. I saw in a moment that, should this
development proceed both with force and logic, my <div class="bookquote">``story''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>would leave
nothing to be desired. There is always, of course, for the
story-teller, the irresistible determinant and the incalculable
advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) interest in the story AS SUCH; it is ever, obviously,
overwhelmingly, the prime and precious thing -LRB-as other than this I have
never been able to see it-RRB-; as to which what makes for it, with
whatever headlong energy, may be said to pale before the energy with
which it simply makes for itself. It rejoices, none the less, at its
best, to seem to offer itself in a light, to seem to know, and with the
very last knowledge, what it's about--liable as it yet is at moments to
be caught by us with its tongue in its cheek and absolutely no warrant
but its splendid impudence. Let us grant then that the impudence is
always there--there, so to speak, for grace and effect and ALLURE;
there, above all, because the Story is just the spoiled child of art,
and because, as we are always disappointed when the pampered don't
<div class="bookquote">``play up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Story the child</b></font>)</div>we like it, to that extent, to look all its character. It
probably does so, in truth, even when we most flatter ourselves that we
negotiate with it by treaty.

<p/>All of which, again, is but to say that the STEPS, for my fable, placed
themselves with a prompt and, as it were, functional assurance--an air
quite as of readiness to have dispensed with logic had I been in fact
too stupid for my clue. Never, positively, none the less, as the links
multiplied, had I felt less stupid than for the determination of poor
Strether's errand and for the apprehension of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) issue. These things
continued to fall together, as by the neat action of their own weight
and form, even while their commentator scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>commentator</b></font>) head about them;
he (<font color='blue'><b>commentator</b></font>) easily sees now that they were always well in advance of him (<font color='blue'><b>commentator</b></font>). As
the case completed itself he (<font color='blue'><b>commentator</b></font>) had in fact, from a good way behind, to
catch up with them, breathless and a little flurried, as he (<font color='blue'><b>commentator</b></font>) best could.
THE false position, for our belated man of the world--belated because
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had endeavoured so long to escape being one, and now at last had
really to face his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doom--the false position for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I say, was
obviously to have presented himself at the gate of that boundless
menagerie primed with a moral scheme of the most approved pattern which
was yet framed to break down on any approach to vivid facts; that is to
any at all liberal appreciation of them. There would have been of
course the case of the Strether prepared, wherever presenting himself,
only to judge and to feel meanly; but HE (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) would have moved for me, I
confess, enveloped in no legend whatever. The actual man's note, from
the first of our seeing it struck, is the note of discrimination, just
as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drama is to become, under stress, the drama of discrimination.
It would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blest imagination, we have seen, that had
already helped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to discriminate; the element that was for so much of
the pleasure of my cutting thick, as I have intimated, into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
intellectual, into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moral substance. Yet here it was, at the same
time, just here, that a shade for a moment fell across the scene.

<p/>There was the dreadful little old tradition, one of the platitudes of
the human comedy, that people's moral scheme DOES break down in Paris;
that nothing is more frequently observed; that hundreds of thousands of
more or less hypocritical or more or less cynical persons annually
visit the place for the sake of the probable catastrophe, and that I
came late in the day to work myself up about it. There was in fine the
TRIVIAL association, one of the vulgarest in the world; but which give
me pause no longer, I think, simply because its vulgarity is so
advertised. The revolution performed by Strether under the influence
of the most interesting of great cities was to have nothing to do with
any betise of the imputably <div class="bookquote">``tempted''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>state; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to be thrown
forward, rather, thrown quite with violence, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lifelong trick of
intense reflexion: which friendly test indeed was to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) out,
through winding passages, through alternations of darkness and light,
very much IN Paris, but with the surrounding scene itself a minor
matter, a mere symbol for more things than had been dreamt of in the
philosophy of Woollett. Another surrounding scene would have done as
well for our show could it have represented a place in which Strether's
errand was likely to lie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) crisis to await him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). The LIKELY place
had the great merit of sparing me preparations; there would have been
too many involved--not at all impossibilities, only rather worrying and
delaying difficulties--in positing elsewhere Chad Newsome's interesting
relation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) so interesting complexity of relations. Strether's
appointed stage, in fine, could be but Chad's most luckily selected
one. The young man had gone in, as they say, for circumjacent charm;
and where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have found it, by the turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, most
<div class="bookquote">``authentic,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earnest friend's analysis would most find
HIM; as well as where, for that matter, the former's whole analytic
faculty would be led such a wonderful dance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Ambassadors''  (<font color='red'><b>North American Review</b></font>)</div>had been, all conveniently, <div class="bookquote">``arranged for'' (<font color='red'><b>North American Review</b></font>)</div>; its first
appearance was from month to month, in the _North American Review_
during 1903, and I had been open from far back to any pleasant
provocation for ingenuity that might reside in one's actively
adopting--so as to make it, in its way, a small compositional
law--recurrent breaks and resumptions. I had made up my mind here
regularly to exploit and enjoy these often rather rude jolts--having
found, as I believed an admirable way to it; yet every question of form
and pressure, I easily remember, paled in the light of the major
propriety, recognised as soon as really weighed; that of employing but
one centre and keeping it all within my hero's compass. The thing was
to be so much this worthy's intimate adventure that even the projection
of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) consciousness upon it from beginning to end without intermission
or deviation would probably still leave a part of its value for him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>),
and a fortiori for ourselves, unexpressed. I might, however, express
every grain of it that there would be room for--on condition of
contriving a splendid particular economy. Other persons in no small
number were to people the scene, and each with his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) axe to grind,
his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) situation to treat, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) coherency not to fail of, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
or her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) relation to my leading motive, in a word, to establish and carry
on. But Strether's sense of these things, and Strether's only, should
avail me for showing them; I should know them but through his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) more or
less groping knowledge of them, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) very gropings would figure
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) most interesting motions, and a full observance of the rich
rigour I speak of would give me more of the effect I should be most
<div class="bookquote">``after''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>than all other possible observances together. It would give me
a large unity, and that in turn would crown me with the grace to which
the enlightened story-teller will at any time, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interest,
sacrifice if need be all other graces whatever. I refer of course to
the grace of intensity, which there are ways of signally achieving and
ways of signally missing--as we see it, all round us, helplessly and
woefully missed. Not that it isn't, on the other hand, a virtue
eminently subject to appreciation--there being no strict, no absolute
measure of it; so that one may hear it acclaimed where it has quite
escaped one's perception, and see it unnoticed where one has gratefully
hailed it. After all of which I am not sure, either, that the immense
amusement of the whole cluster of difficulties so arrayed may not
operate, for the fond fabulist, when judicious not less than fond, as
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) best of determinants. That charming principle is always there, at
all events, to keep interest fresh: it is a principle, we remember,
essentially ravenous, without scruple and without mercy, appeased with
no cheap nor easy nourishment. It enjoys the costly sacrifice and
rejoices thereby in the very odour of difficulty--even as ogres, with
their <div class="bookquote">``Fee-faw-fum!''  (<font color='red'><b>ogres</b></font>)</div>rejoice in the smell of the blood of Englishmen.

<p/>Thus it was, at all events, that the ultimate, though after all so
speedy, definition of my gentleman's job--his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) coming out, all solemnly
appointed and deputed, to <div class="bookquote">``save''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>Chad, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) then finding the young
man so disobligingly and, at first, so bewilderingly not lost that a
new issue altogether, in the connexion, prodigiously faces them, which
has to be dealt with in a new light--promised as many calls on
ingenuity and on the higher branches of the compositional art as one
could possibly desire. Again and yet again, as, from book to book, I
proceed with my survey, I find no source of interest equal to this
verification after the fact, as I may call it, and the more in detail
the better, of the scheme of consistency <div class="bookquote">``gone in''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>for. As
always--since the charm never fails--the retracing of the process from
point to point brings back the old illusion. The old intentions bloom
again and flower--in spite of all the blossoms they were to have
dropped by the way. This is the charm, as I say, of adventure
TRANSPOSED--the thrilling ups and downs, the intricate ins and outs of
the compositional problem, made after such a fashion admirably
objective, becoming the question at issue and keeping the author's
heart in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) mouth. Such an element, for instance, as his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) intention
that Mrs. Newsome, away off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) finger on the pulse of
Massachusetts, should yet be no less intensely than circuitously
present through the whole thing, should be no less felt as to be
reckoned with than the most direct exhibition, the finest portrayal at
first hand could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), such a sign of artistic good faith, I say,
once it's unmistakeably there, takes on again an actuality not too much
impaired by the comparative dimness of the particular success.
Cherished intention too inevitably acts and operates, in the book,
about fifty times as little as I had fondly dreamt it might; but that
scarce spoils for me the pleasure of recognising the fifty ways in
which I had sought to provide for it. The mere charm of seeing such an
idea constituent, in its degree; the fineness of the measures taken--a
real extension, if successful, of the very terms and possibilities of
representation and figuration--such things alone were, after this
fashion, inspiring, such things alone were a gage of the probable
success of that dissimulated calculation with which the whole effort
was to square. But oh the cares begotten, none the less, of that same
<div class="bookquote">``judicious''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sacrifice to a particular form of interest! One's work
should have composition, because composition alone is positive beauty;
but all the while--apart from one's inevitable consciousness too of the
dire paucity of readers ever recognising or ever missing positive
beauty--how, as to the cheap and easy, at every turn, how, as to
immediacy and facility, and even as to the commoner vivacity, positive
beauty might have to be sweated for and paid for! Once achieved and
installed it may always be trusted to make the poor seeker feel he (<font color='blue'><b>seeker</b></font>)
would have blushed to the roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>seeker</b></font>) hair for failing of it; yet,
how, as its virtue can be essentially but the virtue of the whole, the
wayside traps set in the interest of muddlement and pleading but the
cause of the moment, of the particular bit in itself, have to be kicked
out of the path! All the sophistications in life, for example, might
have appeared to muster on behalf of the menace--the menace to a bright
variety--involved in Strether's having all the subjective <div class="bookquote">``say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>as it
were, to himself.

<p/>Had I, meanwhile, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at once hero and historian, endowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with
the romantic privilege of the <div class="bookquote">``first person'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--the darkest abyss of
romance this, inveterately, when enjoyed on the grand scale--variety,
and many other queer matters as well, might have been smuggled in by a
back door. Suffice it, to be brief, that the first person, in the long
piece, is a form foredoomed to looseness and that looseness, never much
my affair, had never been so little so as on this particular occasion.
All of which reflexions flocked to the standard from the moment--a very
early one--the question of how to keep my form amusing while sticking
so close to my central figure and constantly taking its pattern from
him (<font color='blue'><b>queer</b></font>) had to be faced. He (<font color='blue'><b>queer</b></font>) arrives -LRB-arrives at Chester-RRB- as for the
dreadful purpose of giving his (<font color='blue'><b>queer</b></font>) creator <div class="bookquote">``no end''  (<font color='red'><b>creator</b></font>)</div>to tell about
him (<font color='blue'><b>queer</b></font>)--before which rigorous mission the serenest of creators might well
have quailed. I was far from the serenest; I was more than agitated
enough to reflect that, grimly deprived of one alternative or one
substitute for <div class="bookquote">``telling,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I must address myself tooth and nail to
another. I couldn't, save by implication, make other persons tell EACH
OTHER about him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>)--blest resource, blest necessity, of the drama, which
reaches its effects of unity, all remarkably, by paths absolutely
opposite to the paths of the novel: with other persons, save as they
were primarily HIS (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) persons -LRB-not he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) primarily but one of theirs-RRB-, I had
simply nothing to do. I had relations for him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) none the less, by the
mercy of Providence, quite as much as if my exhibition was to be a
muddle; if I could only by implication and a show of consequence make
other persons tell each other about him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>), I could at least make him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) tell
THEM whatever in the world he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) must; and could so, by the same
token--which was a further luxury thrown in--see straight into the deep
differences between what that could do for me, or at all events for
HIM, and the large ease of <div class="bookquote">``autobiography.''  (<font color='red'><b>HIM</b></font>)</div>It may be asked why, if
one so keeps to one's hero, one shouldn't make a single mouthful of
<div class="bookquote">``method,''  (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div>shouldn't throw the reins on his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) neck and, letting them flap
there as free as in <div class="bookquote">``Gil Blas''  (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div>or in <div class="bookquote">``David Copperfield,''  (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div>equip him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
with the double privilege of subject and object--a course that has at
least the merit of brushing away questions at a sweep. The answer to
which is, I think, that one makes that surrender only if one is
prepared NOT to make certain precious discriminations.

<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``first person''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>then, so employed, is addressed by the author
directly to ourselves, his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) possible readers, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) has to reckon
with, at the best, by our English tradition, so loosely and vaguely
after all, so little respectfully, on so scant a presumption of
exposure to criticism. Strether, on the other hand, encaged and
provided for as <div class="bookquote">``The Ambassadors''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>encages and provides, has to keep in
view proprieties much stiffer and more salutary than any our straight
and credulous gape are likely to bring home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), has exhibitional
conditions to meet, in a word, that forbid the terrible FLUIDITY of
self-revelation. I may seem not to better the case for my
discrimination if I say that, for my first care, I had thus inevitably
to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) up a confidant or two, to wave away with energy the custom
of the seated mass of explanation after the fact, the inserted block of
merely referential narrative, which flourishes so, to the shame of the
modern impatience, on the serried page of Balzac, but which seems
simply to appal our actual, our general weaker, digestion. <div class="bookquote">``Harking
back to make up''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>took at any rate more doing, as the phrase is, not
only than the reader of to-day demands, but than he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will tolerate at
any price any call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) either to understand or remotely to
measure; and for the beauty of the thing when done the current
editorial mind in particular appears wholly without sense. It is not,
however, primarily for either of these reasons, whatever their weight,
that Strether's friend Waymarsh is so keenly clutched at, on the
threshold of the book, or that no less a pounce is made on Maria
Gostrey--without even the pretext, either, of HER being, in essence,
Strether's friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) is the reader's friend much rather--in
consequence of dispositions that make him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so eminently require one; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) acts in that capacity, and REALLY in that capacity alone, with
exemplary devotion from beginning to and of the book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) is an
enrolled, a direct, aid to lucidity; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) is in fine, to tear off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
mask, the most unmitigated and abandoned of ficelles. Half the
dramatist's art, as we well know--since if we don't it's not the fault
of the proofs that lie scattered about us--is in the use of ficelles;
by which I mean in a deep dissimulation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) dependence on them.
Waymarsh only to a slighter degree belongs, in the whole business, less
to my subject than to my treatment of it; the interesting proof, in
these connexions, being that one has but to take one's subject for the
stuff of drama to interweave with enthusiasm as many Gostreys as need
be.

<p/>The material of <div class="bookquote">``The Ambassadors,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>conforming in this respect exactly
to that of <div class="bookquote">``The Wings of the Dove,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>published just before it, is taken
absolutely for the stuff of drama; so that, availing myself of the
opportunity given me by this edition for some prefatory remarks on the
latter work, I had mainly to make on its behalf the point of its scenic
consistency. It disguises that virtue, in the oddest way in the world,
by just LOOKING, as we turn its pages, as little scenic as possible;
but it sharply divides itself, just as the composition before us does,
into the parts that prepare, that tend in fact to over-prepare, for
scenes, and the parts, or otherwise into the scenes, that justify and
crown the preparation. It may definitely be said, I think, that
everything in it that is not scene -LRB-not, I of course mean, complete and
functional scene, treating ALL the submitted matter, as by logical
start, logical turn, and logical finish-RRB- is discriminated preparation,
is the fusion and synthesis of picture. These alternations propose
themselves all recogniseably, I think, from an early stage, as the very
form and figure of <div class="bookquote">``The Ambassadors'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>; so that, to repeat, such an agent
as Miss Gostrey pre-engaged at a high salary, but waits in the draughty
wing with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shawl and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smelling-salts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) function speaks at
once for itself, and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has dined with Strether in London
and gone to a play with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) intervention as a ficelle is, I hold,
expertly justified. Thanks to it we have treated scenically, and
scenically alone, the whole lumpish question of Strether's <div class="bookquote">``past,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>which has seen us more happily on the way than anything else could have
done; we have strained to a high lucidity and vivacity -LRB-or at least we
hope we have-RRB- certain indispensable facts; we have seen our two or
three immediate friends all conveniently and profitably in <div class="bookquote">``action'' (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>; to
say nothing of our beginning to descry others, of a remoter intensity,
getting into motion, even if a bit vaguely as yet, for our further
enrichment. Let my first point be here that the scene in question,
that in which the whole situation at Woollett and the complex forces
that have propelled my hero to where this lively extractor of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) value
and distiller of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) essence awaits him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), is normal and entire, is
really an excellent STANDARD scene; copious, comprehensive, and
accordingly never short, but with its office as definite as that of the
hammer on the gong of the clock, the office of expressing ALL THAT IS
IN the hour.

<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``ficelle''  (<font color='red'><b>The ficelle character</b></font>)</div>character of the subordinate party is as artfully
dissimulated, throughout, as may be, and to that extent that, with the
seams or joints of Maria Gostrey's ostensible connectedness taken
particular care of, duly smoothed over, that is, and anxiously kept
from showing as <div class="bookquote">``pieced on;''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>this figure doubtless achieves, after a
fashion, something of the dignity of a prime idea: which circumstance
but shows us afresh how many quite incalculable but none the less clear
sources of enjoyment for the infatuated artist, how many copious
springs of our never-to-be-slighted <div class="bookquote">``fun''  (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div>for the reader and critic
susceptible of contagion, may sound their incidental plash as soon as
an artistic process begins to enjoy free development. Exquisite--in
illustration of this--the mere interest and amusement of such at once
<div class="bookquote">``creative''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>and critical questions as how and where and why to make Miss
Gostrey's false connexion carry itself, under a due high polish, as a
real one. Nowhere is it more of an artful expedient for mere
consistency of form, to mention a case, than in the last <div class="bookquote">``scene''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of the
book, where its function is to give or to add nothing whatever, but
only to express as vividly as possible certain things quite other than
itself and that are of the already fixed and appointed measure. Since,
however, all art is EXPRESSION, and is thereby vividness, one was to
find the door open here to any amount of delightful dissimulation.
These verily are the refinements and ecstasies of method--amid which,
or certainly under the influence of any exhilarated demonstration of
which, one must keep one's head and not lose one's way. To cultivate
an adequate intelligence for them and to make that sense operative is
positively to find a charm in any produced ambiguity of appearance that
is not by the same stroke, and all helplessly, an ambiguity of sense.
To project imaginatively, for my hero, a relation that has nothing to
do with the matter -LRB-the matter of my subject-RRB- but has everything to do
with the manner -LRB-the manner of my presentation of the same-RRB- and yet to
treat it, at close quarters and for fully economic expression's
possible sake, as if it were important and essential--to do that sort
of thing and yet muddle nothing may easily become, as one goes, a
signally attaching proposition; even though it all remains but part and
parcel, I hasten to recognise, of the merely general and related
question of expressional curiosity and expressional decency.

<p/>I am moved to add after so much insistence on the scenic side of my
labour that I have found the steps of re-perusal almost as much waylaid
here by quite another style of effort in the same signal interest--or
have in other words not failed to note how, even so associated and so
discriminated, the finest proprieties and charms of the non-scenic may,
under the right hand for them, still keep their intelligibility and
assert their office. Infinitely suggestive such an observation as this
last on the whole delightful head, where representation is concerned,
of possible variety, of effective expressional change and contrast. One
would like, at such an hour as this, for critical licence, to go into
the matter of the noted inevitable deviation -LRB-from too fond an original
vision-RRB- that the exquisite treachery even of the straightest execution
may ever be trusted to inflict even on the most mature plan--the case
being that, though one's last reconsidered production always seems to
bristle with that particular evidence, <div class="bookquote">``The Ambassadors''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>would place a
flood of such light at my service. I must attach to my final remark
here a different import; noting in the other connexion I just glanced
at that such passages as that of my hero's first encounter with Chad
Newsome, absolute attestations of the non-scenic form though they be,
yet lay the firmest hand too--so far at least as intention goes--on
representational effect. To report at all closely and completely of
what <div class="bookquote">``passes''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>on a given occasion is inevitably to become more or less
scenic; and yet in the instance I allude to, WITH the conveyance,
expressional curiosity and expressional decency are sought and arrived
at under quite another law. The true inwardness of this may be at
bottom but that one of the suffered treacheries has consisted
precisely, for Chad's whole figure and presence, of a direct
presentability diminished and compromised--despoiled, that is, of its
PROPORTIONAL advantage; so that, in a word, the whole economy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
author's relation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has at important points to be redetermined.
The book, however, critically viewed, is touchingly full of these
disguised and repaired losses, these insidious recoveries, these
intensely redemptive consistencies. The pages in which Mamie Pocock
gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) appointed and, I can't but think, duly felt lift to the whole
action by the so inscrutably-applied side-stroke or short-cut of our
just watching and as quite at an angle of vision as yet untried, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
single hour of suspense in the hotel salon, in our partaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
concentrated study of the sense of matters bearing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) own case, all
the bright warm Paris afternoon, from the balcony that overlooks the
Tuileries garden--these are as marked an example of the
representational virtue that insists here and there on being, for the
charm of opposition and renewal, other than the scenic. It wouldn't
take much to make me further argue that from an equal play of such
oppositions the book gathers an intensity that fairly adds to the
dramatic--though the latter is supposed to be the sum of all
intensities; or that has at any rate nothing to fear from juxtaposition
with it. I consciously fail to shrink in fact from that
extravagance--I risk it rather, for the sake of the moral involved;
which is not that the particular production before us exhausts the
interesting questions it raises, but that the Novel remains still,
under the right persuasion, the most independent, most elastic, most
prodigious of literary forms.


<p/>HENRY JAMES.





<p/>Book First



<p/>I

<p/>Strether's first question, when he (<font color='blue'><b>JAMES</b></font>) reached the hotel, was about his (<font color='blue'><b>JAMES</b></font>)
friend; yet on his (<font color='blue'><b>JAMES</b></font>) learning that Waymarsh was apparently not to arrive
till evening he (<font color='blue'><b>JAMES</b></font>) was not wholly disconcerted. A telegram from him (<font color='blue'><b>JAMES</b></font>)
bespeaking a room <div class="bookquote">``only if not noisy,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>reply paid, was produced for the
enquirer at the office, so that the understanding they should meet at
Chester rather than at Liverpool remained to that extent sound. The
same secret principle, however, that had prompted Strether not
absolutely to desire Waymarsh's presence at the dock, that had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
thus to postpone for a few hours his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) enjoyment of it, now operated to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could still wait without disappointment. They would
dine together at the worst, and, with all respect to dear old
Waymarsh--if not even, for that matter, to himself--there was little
fear that in the sequel they shouldn't see enough of each other. The
principle I have just mentioned as operating had been, with the most
newly disembarked of the two men, wholly instinctive--the fruit of a
sharp sense that, delightful as it would be to find himself looking,
after so much separation, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comrade's face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) business would
be a trifle bungled should he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) simply arrange for this countenance to
present itself to the nearing steamer as the first <div class="bookquote">``note,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of Europe.
Mixed with everything was the apprehension, already, on Strether's
part, that it would, at best, throughout, prove the note of Europe in
quite a sufficient degree.

<p/>That note had been meanwhile--since the previous afternoon, thanks to
this happier device--such a consciousness of personal freedom as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
hadn't known for years; such a deep taste of change and of having above
all for the moment nobody and nothing to consider, as promised already,
if headlong hope were not too foolish, to colour his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) adventure with
cool success. There were people on the ship with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had easily
consorted--so far as ease could up to now be imputed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--and who
for the most part plunged straight into the current that set from the
landing-stage to London; there were others who had invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to a
tryst at the inn and had even invoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) aid for a <div class="bookquote">``look round''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>at the
beauties of Liverpool; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had stolen away from every one alike, had
kept no appointment and renewed no acquaintance, had been indifferently
aware of the number of persons who esteemed themselves fortunate in
being, unlike himself, <div class="bookquote">``met,''  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>and had even independently, unsociably,
alone, without encounter or relapse and by mere quiet evasion, given
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) afternoon and evening to the immediate and the sensible. They
formed a qualified draught of Europe, an afternoon and an evening on
the banks of the Mersey, but such as it was he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) potion at least
undiluted. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) winced a little, truly, at the thought that Waymarsh
might be already at Chester; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) reflected that, should he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) have to
describe himself there as having <div class="bookquote">``got in''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>so early, it would be
difficult to make the interval look particularly eager; but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was like
a man who, elatedly finding in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) pocket more money than usual,
handles it a while and idly and pleasantly chinks it before addressing
himself to the business of spending. That he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was prepared to be vague
to Waymarsh about the hour of the ship's touching, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) both
wanted extremely to see him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) and enjoyed extremely the duration of
delay--these things, it is to be conceived, were early signs in him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
that his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) actual errand might prove none of the
simplest. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was burdened, poor Strether--it had better be confessed
at the outset--with the oddity of a double consciousness. There was
detachment in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) zeal and curiosity in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) indifference.

<p/>After the young woman in the glass cage had held up to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) across her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
counter the pale-pink leaflet bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) friend's name, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
neatly pronounced, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) turned away to find himself, in the hall, facing
a lady who met his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) eyes as with an intention suddenly determined, and
whose features--not freshly young, not markedly fine, but on happy
terms with each other--came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) as from a recent vision. For a
moment they stood confronted; then the moment placed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had
noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the day before, noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) previous inn,
where--again in the hall--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been briefly engaged with some people
of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own ship's company. Nothing had actually passed between them,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) would as little have been able to say what had been the sign of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) on the first occasion as to name the ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
present recognition. Recognition at any rate appeared to prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
own side as well--which would only have added to the mystery. All she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
now began by saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) nevertheless was that, having chanced to
catch his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) enquiry, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was moved to ask, by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) leave, if it were
possibly a question of Mr. Waymarsh of Milrose Connecticut--Mr.
Waymarsh the American lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``my very well-known friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s to meet me
here, coming up from Malvern, and I supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'d already have arrived.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) doesn't come till later, and I'm relieved not to have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Strether wound up.

<p/>It wasn't till after he (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had spoken that he (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) became aware of how much
there had been in him (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) of response; when the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own rejoinder,
as well as the play of something more in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face--something more, that
is, than its apparently usual restless light--seemed to notify him (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I've met him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at Milrose--where I used sometimes, a good while ago, to
stay; I had friends there who were friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and I've been at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
house. I won't answer for it that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would know me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether's new
acquaintance pursued; <div class="bookquote">``but I should be delighted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Perhaps,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Strether acquaintance</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I shall--for I'm staying over.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paused while our
friend took in these things, and it was as if a good deal of talk had
already passed. They even vaguely smiled at it, and Strether presently
observed that Mr. Waymarsh would, no doubt, be easily to be seen. This,
however, appeared to affect the lady as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might have advanced too
far. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared to have no reserves about anything. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) won't care!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) immediately thereupon remarked that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
believed Strether knew the Munsters; the Munsters being the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with at Liverpool.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't, it happened, know the Munsters well enough to give the
case much of a lift; so that they were left together as if over the
mere laid table of conversation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) qualification of the mentioned
connexion had rather removed than placed a dish, and there seemed
nothing else to serve. Their attitude remained, none the less, that of
not forsaking the board; and the effect of this in turn was to give
them the appearance of having accepted each other with an absence of
preliminaries practically complete. They moved along the hall
together, and Strether's companion threw off that the hotel had the
advantage of a garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was aware by this time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) strange
inconsequence: he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had shirked the intimacies of the steamer and had
muffled the shock of Waymarsh only to find himself forsaken, in this
sudden case, both of avoidance and of caution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) passed, under this
unsought protection and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had so much as gone up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) room,
into the garden of the hotel, and at the end of ten minutes had agreed
to meet there again, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should have made himself tidy, the
dispenser of such good assurances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted to look at the town, and
they would forthwith look together. It was almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had been
in possession and received him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as a guest. Her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) acquaintance with the
place presented her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) in a manner as a hostess, and Strether had a rueful
glance for the lady in the glass cage. It was as if this personage had
seen herself instantly superseded.

<p/>When in a quarter of an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came down, what his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hostess saw, what
she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) might have taken in with a vision kindly adjusted, was the lean,
the slightly loose figure of a man of the middle height and something
more perhaps than the middle age--a man of five-and-fifty, whose most
immediate signs were a marked bloodless brownness of face, a thick dark
moustache, of characteristically American cut, growing strong and
falling low, a head of hair still abundant but irregularly streaked
with grey, and a nose of bold free prominence, the even line, the high
finish, as it might have been called, of which, had a certain effect of
mitigation. A perpetual pair of glasses astride of this fine ridge,
and a line, unusually deep and drawn, the prolonged pen-stroke of time,
accompanying the curve of the moustache from nostril to chin, did
something to complete the facial furniture that an attentive observer
would have seen catalogued, on the spot, in the vision of the other
party to Strether's appointment. She (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in the garden, the
other party, drawing on a pair of singularly fresh soft and elastic
light gloves and presenting herself with a superficial readiness which,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) over the small smooth lawn and in the watery
English sunshine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) rougher preparation, have marked
as the model for such an occasion. She (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) had, this lady, a perfect plain
propriety, an expensive subdued suitability, that her (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) companion was not
free to analyse, but that struck him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), so that his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) consciousness of it
was instantly acute, as a quality quite new to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). Before reaching
her (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) stopped on the grass and went through the form of feeling for
something, possibly forgotten, in the light overcoat he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) carried on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
arm; yet the essence of the act was no more than the impulse to gain
time. Nothing could have been odder than Strether's sense of himself
as at that moment launched in something of which the sense would be
quite disconnected from the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) past and which was literally
beginning there and then. It had begun in fact already upstairs and
before the dressing glass that struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as blocking further, so
strangely, the dimness of the window of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) dull bedroom; begun with a
sharper survey of the elements of Appearance than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had for a long
time been moved to make. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had during those moments felt these
elements to be not so much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should have liked, and
then had fallen back on the thought that they were precisely a matter
as to which help was supposed to come from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was about to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
was about to go up to London, so that hat and necktie might wait. What
had come as straight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as a ball in a well-played game--and caught
moreover not less neatly--was just the air, in the person of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
friend, of having seen and chosen, the air of achieved possession of
those vague qualities and quantities that collectively figured to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
as the advantage snatched from lucky chances. Without pomp or
circumstance, certainly, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) original address to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), equally with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own response, had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have sketched to himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as: <div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s more thoroughly civilized--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If
<div class="bookquote">``More thoroughly than WHOM?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>would not have been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a sequel to
this remark, that was just by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) deep consciousness of the
bearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comparison.

<p/>The amusement, at all events, of a civilisation intenser was
what--familiar compatriot as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was, with the full tone of the
compatriot and the rattling link not with mystery but only with dear
dyspeptic Waymarsh--she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) appeared distinctly to promise. His (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) pause
while he (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) overcoat was positively the pause of confidence,
and it enabled his (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) eyes to make out as much of a case for her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), in
proportion, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own made out for himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) affected him (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) as
almost insolently young; but an easily carried five-and-thirty could
still do that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was, however, like himself marked and wan; only it
naturally couldn't have been known to him (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) how much a spectator looking
from one to the other might have discerned that they had in common. It
wouldn't for such a spectator have been altogether insupposable that,
each so finely brown and so sharply spare, each confessing so to dents
of surface and aids to sight, to a disproportionate nose and a head
delicately or grossly grizzled, they might have been brother and
sister. On this ground indeed there would have been a residuum of
difference; such a sister having surely known in respect to such a
brother the extremity of separation, and such a brother now feeling in
respect to such a sister the extremity of surprise. Surprise, it was
true, was not on the other hand what the eyes of Strether's friend most
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gloves smoother, the time
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) appreciated. They had taken hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) straightway measuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
up and down as if they knew how; as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) were human material they had
already in some sort handled. Their possessor was in truth, it may be
communicated, the mistress of a hundred cases or categories,
receptacles of the mind, subdivisions for convenience, in which, from a
full experience, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) pigeon-holed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) fellow mortals with a hand as
free as that of a compositor scattering type. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was as equipped in
this particular as Strether was the reverse, and it made an opposition
between them which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might well have shrunk from submitting to if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had fully suspected it. So far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) did suspect it he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was on the
contrary, after a short shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) consciousness, as pleasantly
passive as might be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really had a sort of sense of what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) knew.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had quite the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) knew things he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't, and though this
was a concession that in general he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found not easy to make to women, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
made it now as good-humouredly as if it lifted a burden. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes were
so quiet behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eternal nippers that they might almost have been
absent without changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) face, which took its expression mainly, and
not least its stamp of sensibility, from other sources, surface and
grain and form. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) guide in an instant, and then felt she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
had profited still better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) having been for the moments
just mentioned, so at the disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) intelligence. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) knew even
intimate things about him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't yet told her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) and perhaps never
would. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wasn't unaware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) rather remarkably many
for the time, but these were not the real ones. Some of the real ones,
however, precisely, were what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) knew.

<p/>They were to pass again through the hall of the inn to get into the
street, and it was here she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) presently checked him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with a question.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you looked up my name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could only stop with a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Have you looked up mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes--as soon as you left me. I went to the office and asked.
Hadn't YOU better do the same?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Find out who you are?--after the uplifted young woman
there has seen us thus scrape acquaintance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) laughed on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) side now at the shade of alarm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) amusement.
<div class="bookquote">``Isn't it a reason the more? If what you're afraid of is the injury
for me--my being seen to walk off with a gentleman who has to ask who I
am--I assure you I don't in the least mind. Here, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``is my card, and as I find there's something else again I
have to say at the office, you can just study it during the moment I
leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) the small pasteboard she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had
extracted from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) pocket-book, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had extracted another from his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
own, to exchange with it, before she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) came back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) read thus the
simple designation <div class="bookquote">``Maria Gostrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>to which was attached, in a corner
of the card, with a number, the name of a street, presumably in Paris,
without other appreciable identity than its foreignness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put the
card into his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) waistcoat pocket, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own meanwhile in evidence;
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) leaned against the door-post he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) met with the smile of a
straying thought what the expanse before the hotel offered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) view.
It was positively droll to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should already have Maria
Gostrey, whoever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was--of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't really the least idea--in
a place of safe keeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had somehow an assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should
carefully preserve the little token he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had just tucked in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gazed
with unseeing lingering eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) followed some of the implications of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) act, asking himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really felt admonished to qualify it as
disloyal. It was prompt, it was possibly even premature, and there was
little doubt of the expression of face the sight of it would have
produced in a certain person. But if it was <div class="bookquote">``wrong'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--why then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
better not have come out at all. At this, poor man, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
already--and even before meeting Waymarsh--arrived. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had believed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had a limit, but the limit had been transcended within thirty-six
hours. By how long a space on the plane of manners or even of morals,
moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt still more sharply after Maria Gostrey had come back
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and with a gay decisive <div class="bookquote">``So now--!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forth into the
world. This counted, it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
overcoat on an arm, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) umbrella under another and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal
pasteboard a little stiffly retained between forefinger and thumb, this
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as really, in comparison his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) introduction to things. It
hadn't been <div class="bookquote">``Europe''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>at Liverpool no--not even in the dreadful
delightful impressive streets the night before--to the extent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
present companion made it so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) hadn't yet done that so much as
when, after their walk had lasted a few minutes and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had time to
wonder if a couple of sidelong glances from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had best
have put on gloves she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) almost pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up with an amused challenge.
<div class="bookquote">``But why--fondly as it's so easy to imagine your clinging to it--don't
you put it away? Or if it's an inconvenience to you to carry it, one's
often glad to have one's card back. The fortune one spends in them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw both that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way of marching with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own prepared tribute
had affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) as a deviation in one of those directions he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't
yet measure, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) supposed this emblem to be still the one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accordingly handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) the card as if in
restitution, but as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had it she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) felt the difference and,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) eyes on it, stopped short for apology. <div class="bookquote">``I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) observed,
<div class="bookquote">``your name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``you won't have heard of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reasons
for not being sure but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) perhaps might.

<p/>Ah it was but too visible! She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) read it over again as one who had never
seen it. <div class="bookquote">''`Mr. Lewis Lambert Strether''' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) sounded it almost as
freely as for any stranger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) repeated however that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) liked
it--<div class="bookquote">``particularly the Lewis Lambert. It's the name of a novel of
Balzac's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I know that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the novel's an awfully bad one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether smiled. To which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added with an
irrelevance that was only superficial: <div class="bookquote">``I come from Woollett
Massachusetts.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) for some reason--the irrelevance or
whatever--laugh. Balzac had described many cities, but hadn't
described Woollett Massachusetts. <div class="bookquote">``You say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``as if
you wanted one immediately to know the worst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I think it's a thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that you must already have made
out. I feel it so that I certainly must look it, speak it, and, as
people say there, `act' it. It sticks out of me, and you knew surely
for yourself as soon as you looked at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The worst, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the fact of where I come from. There at any rate it IS; so that
you won't be able, if anything happens, to say I've not been straight
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and Miss Gostrey looked really interested in the point he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
made. <div class="bookquote">``But what do you think of as happening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wasn't shy--which was rather anomalous--Strether gazed about
without meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) eyes; a motion that was frequent with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in talk,
yet of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) words often seemed not at all the effect. <div class="bookquote">``Why that
you should find me too hopeless.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which they walked on again
together while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) answered, as they went, that the most <div class="bookquote">``hopeless''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) countryfolk were in general precisely those she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) liked best. All
sorts of other pleasant small things-small things that were yet large
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--flowered in the air of the occasion, but the bearing of the
occasion itself on matters still remote concerns us too closely to
permit us to multiply our illustrations. Two or three, however, in
truth, we should perhaps regret to lose. The tortuous wall--girdle,
long since snapped, of the little swollen city, half held in place by
careful civic hands--wanders in narrow file between parapets smoothed
by peaceful generations, pausing here and there for a dismantled gate
or a bridged gap, with rises and drops, steps up and steps down, queer
twists, queer contacts, peeps into homely streets and under the brows
of gables, views of cathedral tower and waterside fields, of huddled
English town and ordered English country. Too deep almost for words
was the delight of these things to Strether; yet as deeply mixed with
it were certain images of his (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) inward picture. He (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) had trod this walks
in the far-off time, at twenty-five; but that, instead of spoiling it,
only enriched it for present feeling and marked his (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) renewal as a thing
substantial enough to share. It was with Waymarsh he (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) should have
shared it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) was now accordingly taking from him (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) something that
was his (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) due. He (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) looked repeatedly at his (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) watch, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) had done
so for the fifth time Miss Gostrey took him (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're doing something that you think not right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It so touched the place that he (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) quite changed colour and his (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) laugh grew
almost awkward. <div class="bookquote">``Am I enjoying it as much as THAT?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not enjoying it, I think, so much as you ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) appeared thoughtfully to agree. <div class="bookquote">``Great is my privilege.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh it's not your privilege! It has nothing to do with me. It has to
do with yourself. Your failure's general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah there you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) laughed. ``It's the failure of Woollett. THAT<div class="bookquote">``S
general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The failure to enjoy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey explained, <div class="bookquote">``is what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely. Woollett isn't sure it ought to enjoy. If it were it
would. But it hasn't, poor thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether continued, <div class="bookquote">``any one to
show it how. It's not like me. I have somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>They had stopped, in the afternoon sunshine--constantly pausing, in
their stroll, for the sharper sense of what they saw--and Strether
rested on one of the high sides of the old stony groove of the little
rampart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) leaned back on this support with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) face to the tower of
the cathedral, now admirably commanded by their station, the high
red-brown mass, square and subordinately spired and crocketed,
retouched and restored, but charming to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) long-sealed eyes and with
the first swallows of the year weaving their flight all round it. Miss
Gostrey lingered near him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), full of an air, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) more and more
justified her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) right, of understanding the effect of things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) quite
concurred. <div class="bookquote">``You've indeed somebody.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``I wish you WOULD
let me show you how!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I'm afraid of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) cheerfully pleaded.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kept on him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a moment, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) glasses and through his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own, a
certain pleasant pointedness. <div class="bookquote">``Ah no, you're not! You're not in the
least, thank goodness! If you had been we shouldn't so soon have found
ourselves here together. I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) comfortably concluded, <div class="bookquote">``you
trust me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do!--but that's exactly what I'm afraid of. I shouldn't
mind if I didn't. It's falling thus in twenty minutes so utterly into
your hands. I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether continued, <div class="bookquote">``it's a sort of thing
you're thoroughly familiar with; but nothing more extraordinary has
ever happened to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kindness. <div class="bookquote">``That means simply that you've
recognised me--which IS rather beautiful and rare. You see what I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As on this, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) protested, with a good-humoured headshake, a
resignation of any such claim, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had a moment of explanation. ``If
you'll only come on further as you HAVE come you'll at any rate make
out. My own fate has been too many for me, and I've succumbed to it.
I'm a general guide--to ``Europe,'' don't you know? I wait for people--I
put them through. I pick them up--I set them down. I'm a sort of
superior ``courier-maid.<div class="bookquote">'' I'm a companion at large. I take people, as
I've told you, about. I never sought it--it has come to me. It has
been my fate, and one's fate one accepts. It's a dreadful thing to
have to say, in so wicked a world, but I verily believe that, such as
you see me, there's nothing I don't know. I know all the shops and the
prices--but I know worse things still. I bear on my back the huge load
of our national consciousness, or, in other words--for it comes to
that--of our nation itself. Of what is our nation composed but of the
men and women individually on my shoulders? I don't do it, you know,
for any particular advantage. I don't do it, for instance--some people
do, you know--for money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether could only listen and wonder and weigh his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) chance. <div class="bookquote">``And yet,
affected as you are then to so many of your clients, you can scarcely
be said to do it for love.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) waited a moment. <div class="bookquote">``How do we reward
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own hesitation, but <div class="bookquote">``You don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) finally returned,
setting him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) again in motion. They went on, but in a few minutes,
though while still thinking over what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) once more took
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) watch; mechanically, unconsciously and as if made nervous by
the mere exhilaration of what struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) strange and cynical
wit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at the hour without seeing it, and then, on something
again said by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion, had another pause. <div class="bookquote">``You're really in
terror of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smiled a smile that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost felt to be sickly. <div class="bookquote">``Now you can see
why I'm afraid of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I've such illuminations? Why they're all for your help! It's
what I told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``just now. You feel as if this were
wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fell back once more, settling himself against the parapet as if to
hear more about it. <div class="bookquote">``Then get me out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face fairly brightened for the joy of the appeal, but, as if it
were a question of immediate action, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) visibly considered. <div class="bookquote">``Out of
waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?--of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said poor Strether, looking grave. <div class="bookquote">``I've got to
wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)--and I want very much to see him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). But out of the terror.
You did put your finger on it a few minutes ago. It's general, but it
avails itself of particular occasions. That's what it's doing for me
now. I'm always considering something else; something else, I mean,
than the thing of the moment. The obsession of the other thing is the
terror. I'm considering at present for instance something else than
YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) listened with charming earnestness. <div class="bookquote">``Oh you oughtn't to do that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's what I admit. Make it then impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) continued to think. <div class="bookquote">``Is it really an `order' from you?--that I
shall take the job? WILL you give yourself up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Strether heaved his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sigh. <div class="bookquote">``If I only could! But that's the deuce
of it--that I never can. No--I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wasn't, however, discouraged. <div class="bookquote">``But you want to at least?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh unspeakably!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then, if you'll try!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took over the job, as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had called
it, on the spot. <div class="bookquote">``Trust me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) exclaimed, and the action of this, as
they retraced their steps, was presently to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand into
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arm in the manner of a benign dependent paternal old person who
wishes to be <div class="bookquote">``nice''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>to a younger one. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) drew it out again indeed
as they approached the inn this may have been because, after more talk
had passed between them, the relation of age, or at least of
experience--which, for that matter, had already played to and fro with
some freedom--affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as incurring a readjustment. It was at all
events perhaps lucky that they arrived in sufficiently separate fashion
within range of the hotel-door. The young lady they had left in the
glass cage watched as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had come to await them on the threshold.
At her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) side stood a person equally interested, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) attitude, in
their return, and the effect of the sight of whom was instantly to
determine for Strether another of those responsive arrests that we have
had so repeatedly to note. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) left it to Miss Gostrey to name, with
the fine full bravado as it almost struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Waymarsh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>what was to have been, what--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) more than ever felt as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) short stare
of suspended welcome took things in--would have been, but for herself,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) doom. It was already upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) even at that distance--Mr. Waymarsh
was for HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) part joyless.



<p/>II

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had none the less to confess to this friend that evening that he (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
knew almost nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and it was a deficiency that Waymarsh,
even with his (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) memory refreshed by contact, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) own prompt and lucid
allusions and enquiries, by their having publicly partaken of dinner in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) company, and by another stroll, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) was not a stranger,
out into the town to look at the cathedral by moonlight--it was a blank
that the resident of Milrose, though admitting acquaintance with the
Munsters, professed himself unable to fill. He (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) had no recollection of
Miss Gostrey, and two or three questions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) put to him (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) about
those members of his (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) circle had, to Strether's observation, the same
effect he (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) himself had already more directly felt--the effect of
appearing to place all knowledge, for the time, on this original
woman's side. It interested him (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) indeed to mark the limits of any such
relation for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) friend as there could possibly be a question
of, and it particularly struck him (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) that they were to be marked
altogether in Waymarsh's quarter. This added to his (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) own sense of
having gone far with her-gave him (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) an early illustration of a much
shorter course. There was a certitude he (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) immediately grasped--a
conviction that Waymarsh would quite fail, as it were, and on whatever
degree of acquaintances to profit by her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>).

<p/>There had been after the first interchange among the three a talk of
some five minutes in the hall, and then the two men had adjourned to
the garden, Miss Gostrey for the time disappearing. Strether in due
course accompanied his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend to the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had bespoken and had,
before going out, scrupulously visited; where at the end of another
half-hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had no less discreetly left him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). On leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
repaired straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own room, but with the prompt effect of
feeling the compass of that chamber resented by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) condition. There
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) enjoyed at once the first consequence of their reunion. A place was
too small for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) after it that had seemed large enough before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
awaited it with something he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have been sorry, have been almost
ashamed not to recognise as emotion, yet with a tacit assumption at the
same time that emotion would in the event find itself relieved. The
actual oddity was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was only more excited; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) excitement-to
which indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have found it difficult instantly to give a
name--brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) once more downstairs and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for some minutes
vaguely to wander. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went once more to the garden; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked into the
public room, found Miss Gostrey writing letters and backed out; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
roamed, fidgeted and wasted time; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) more intimate
session with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend before the evening closed.

<p/>It was late--not till Strether had spent an hour upstairs with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--that this subject consented to betake himself to doubtful rest.
Dinner and the subsequent stroll by moonlight--a dream, on Strether's
part, of romantic effects rather prosaically merged in a mere missing
of thicker coats--had measurably intervened, and this midnight
conference was the result of Waymarsh's having -LRB-when they were free, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put it, of their fashionable friend-RRB- found the smoking-room not
quite what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted, and yet bed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted less. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) most
frequent form of words was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew himself, and they were applied
on this occasion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) certainty of not sleeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew himself
well enough to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should have a night of prowling unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
should succeed, as a preliminary, in getting prodigiously tired. If
the effort directed to this end involved till a late hour the presence
of Strether--consisted, that is, in the detention of the latter for
full discourse--there was yet an impression of minor discipline
involved for our friend in the picture Waymarsh made as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sat in
trousers and shirt on the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) couch. With his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) long legs
extended and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) large back much bent, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) nursed alternately, for an
almost incredible time, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) elbows and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) beard. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
visitor as extremely, as almost wilfully uncomfortable; yet what had
this been for Strether, from that first glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) disconcerted in
the porch of the hotel, but the predominant notes. The discomfort was
in a manner contagious, as well as also in a manner inconsequent and
unfounded; the visitor felt that unless he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) should get used to it--or
unless Waymarsh himself should--it would constitute a menace for his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
own prepared, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) own already confirmed, consciousness of the
agreeable. On their first going up together to the room Strether had
selected for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) Waymarsh had looked it over in silence and with a sigh
that represented for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion, if not the habit of disapprobation,
at least the despair of felicity; and this look had recurred to
Strether as the key of much he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had since observed. <div class="bookquote">``Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
begun to gather from these things, had up to now rather failed of its
message to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't got into tune with it and had at the end of
three months almost renounced any such expectation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really appeared at present to insist on that by just perching there
with the gas in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes. This of itself somehow conveyed the futility
of single rectifications in a multiform failure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had a large
handsome head and a large sallow seamed face--a striking significant
physiognomic total, the upper range of which, the great political brow,
the thick loose hair, the dark fuliginous eyes, recalled even to a
generation whose standard had dreadfully deviated the impressive image,
familiar by engravings and busts, of some great national worthy of the
earlier part of the mid-century. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was of the personal type--and it
was an element in the power and promise that in their early time
Strether had found in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--of the American statesman, the statesman
trained in <div class="bookquote">``Congressional halls,''  (<font color='red'><b>the statesman</b></font>)</div>of an elder day. The legend had been
in later years that as the lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) face, which was weak, and
slightly crooked, spoiled the likeness, this was the real reason for
the growth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) beard, which might have seemed to spoil it for those
not in the secret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mane; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fixed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) admirable
eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) auditor or his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) observer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wore no glasses and had a way,
partly formidable, yet also partly encouraging, as from a
representative to a constituent, of looking very hard at those who
approached him (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) met you as if you had knocked and he (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) had bidden you
enter. Strether, who hadn't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for so long an interval,
apprehended him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now with a freshness of taste, and had perhaps never
done him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) such ideal justice. The head was bigger, the eyes finer, than
they need have been for the career; but that only meant, after all,
that the career was itself expressive. What it expressed at midnight
in the gas-glaring bedroom at Chester was that the subject of it had,
at the end of years, barely escaped, by flight in time, a general
nervous collapse. But this very proof of the full life, as the full
life was understood at Milrose, would have made to Strether's
imagination an element in which Waymarsh could have floated easily had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) only consented to float. Alas nothing so little resembled floating
as the rigour with which, on the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) posture
of prolonged impermanence. It suggested to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comrade something that
always, when kept up, worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--a person established in a
railway-coach with a forward inclination. It represented the angle at
which poor Waymarsh was to sit through the ordeal of Europe.

<p/>Thanks to the stress of occupation, the strain of professions, the
absorption and embarrassment of each, they had not, at home, during
years before this sudden brief and almost bewildering reign of
comparative ease, found so much as a day for a meeting; a fact that was
in some degree an explanation of the sharpness with which most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
friend's features stood out to Strether. Those he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had lost sight of
since the early time came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); others that it was never
possible to forget struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now as sitting, clustered and expectant,
like a somewhat defiant family-group, on the doorstep of their
residence. The room was narrow for its length, and the occupant of the
bed thrust so far a pair of slippered feet that the visitor had almost
to step over them in his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) recurrent rebounds from his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) chair to fidget
back and forth. There were marks the friends made on things to talk
about, and on things not to, and one of the latter in particular fell
like the tap of chalk on the blackboard. Married at thirty, Waymarsh
had not lived with his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) wife for fifteen years, and it came up vividly
between them in the glare of the gas that Strether wasn't to ask about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew they were still separate and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) lived at hotels,
travelled in Europe, painted her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) face and wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) husband abusive
letters, of not one of which, to a certainty, that sufferer spared
himself the perusal; but he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) respected without difficulty the cold
twilight that had settled on this side of his (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) companion's life. It was
a province in which mystery reigned and as to which Waymarsh had never
spoken the informing word. Strether, who wanted to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the highest
justice wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) COULD do it, singularly admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for the dignity
of this reserve, and even counted it as one of the grounds--grounds all
handled and numbered--for ranking him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), in the range of their
acquaintance, as a success. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) WAS a success, Waymarsh, in spite of
overwork, or prostration, of sensible shrinkage, of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife's letters
and of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) not liking Europe. Strether would have reckoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own
career less futile had he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) been able to put into it anything so handsome
as so much fine silence. One might one's self easily have left Mrs.
Waymarsh; and one would assuredly have paid one's tribute to the ideal
in covering with that attitude the derision of having been left by her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) husband had held his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tongue and had made a large income; and these
were in especial the achievements as to which Strether envied him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). Our
friend had had indeed on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) side too a subject for silence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
fully appreciated; but it was a matter of a different sort, and the
figure of the income he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had arrived at had never been high enough to
look any one in the face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know as I quite see what you require it for. You don't appear
sick to speak of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was of Europe Waymarsh thus finally spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, who fell as much as possible into step, <div class="bookquote">``I guess
I don't FEEL sick now that I've started. But I had pretty well run
down before I did start.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) melancholy look. <div class="bookquote">``Ain't you about up to your usual
average?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not quite pointedly sceptical, but it seemed somehow a plea for
the purest veracity, and it thereby affected our friend as the very
voice of Milrose. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had long since made a mental distinction--though
never in truth daring to betray it--between the voice of Milrose and
the voice even of Woollett. It was the former he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt, that was most
in the real tradition. There had been occasions in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) past when the
sound of it had reduced him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to temporary confusion, and the present,
for some reason, suddenly became such another. It was nevertheless no
light matter that the very effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) confusion should be to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) again prevaricate. <div class="bookquote">``That description hardly does justice to a man
to whom it has done such a lot of good to see YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) washing-stand the silent detached stare with
which Milrose in person, as it were, might have marked the
unexpectedness of a compliment from Woollett, and Strether for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
part, felt once more like Woollett in person. <div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend
presently continued, <div class="bookquote">``that your appearance isn't as bad as I've seen
it: it compares favourably with what it was when I last noticed it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>On this appearance Waymarsh's eyes yet failed to rest; it was almost as
if they obeyed an instinct of propriety, and the effect was still
stronger when, always considering the basin and jug, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``You've
filled out some since then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed: <div class="bookquote">``one does fill out some with
all one takes in, and I've taken in, I dare say, more than I've natural
room for. I was dog-tired when I sailed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>It had the oddest sound of
cheerfulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was dog-tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion returned, <div class="bookquote">``when I arrived, and it's
this wild hunt for rest that takes all the life out of me. The fact
is, Strether--and it's a comfort to have you here at last to say it to;
though I don't know, after all, that I've really waited; I've told it
to people I've met in the cars--the fact is, such a country as this
ain't my KIND of country anyway. There ain't a country I've seen over
here that DOES seem my kind. Oh I don't say but what there are plenty
of pretty places and remarkable old things; but the trouble is that I
don't seem to feel anywhere in tune. That's one of the reasons why I
suppose I've gained so little. I haven't had the first sign of that
lift I was led to expect.''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) broke out more earnestly.
<div class="bookquote">``Look here--I want to go back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes were all attached to Strether's now, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was one of the men
who fully face you when they talk of themselves. This enabled his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
friend to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hard and immediately to appear to the highest
advantage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes by doing so. <div class="bookquote">``That's a genial thing to say to a
fellow who has come out on purpose to meet you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing could have been finer, on this, than Waymarsh's sombre glow.
<div class="bookquote">``HAVE you come out on purpose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--very largely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought from the way you wrote there was something back of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Back of my desire to be with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Back of your prostration.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, with a smile made more dim by a certain consciousness, shook
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``There are all the causes of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And no particular cause that seemed most to drive you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Our friend could at last conscientiously answer. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. One. There IS
a matter that has had much to do with my coming out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh waited a little. <div class="bookquote">``Too private to mention?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not too private--for YOU. Only rather complicated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>said Waymarsh, who had waited again, <div class="bookquote">``I MAY lose my mind over
here, but I don't know as I've done so yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you shall have the whole thing. But not tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh seemed to sit stiffer and to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) elbows tighter. <div class="bookquote">``Why
not--if I can't sleep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, my dear man, I CAN!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then where's your prostration?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just in that--that I can put in eight hours.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And Strether brought it
out that if Waymarsh didn't <div class="bookquote">``gain''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't go to bed:
the result of which was, in its order, that, to do the latter justice,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) permitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend to insist on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really getting settled.
Strether, with a kind coercive hand for it, assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to this
consummation, and again found his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own part in their relation
auspiciously enlarged by the smaller touches of lowering the lamp and
seeing to a sufficiency of blanket. It somehow ministered for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to
indulgence to feel Waymarsh, who looked unnaturally big and black in
bed, as much tucked in as a patient in a hospital and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
covering up to his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) chin, as much simplified by it He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) hovered in vague
pity, to be brief, while his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) companion challenged him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) out of the
bedclothes. <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) really after you? Is that what's behind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether felt an uneasiness at the direction taken by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's
insight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) played a little at uncertainty. <div class="bookquote">``Behind my coming out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Behind your prostration or whatever. It's generally felt, you know,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) follows you up pretty close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's candour was never very far off. <div class="bookquote">``Oh it has occurred to you
that I'm literally running away from Mrs. Newsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I haven't KNOWN but what you are. You're a very attractive man,
Strether. You've seen for yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>said Waymarsh <div class="bookquote">``what that lady
downstairs makes of it. Unless indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) rambled on with an effect
between the ironic and the anxious, <div class="bookquote">``it's you who are after HER. IS
Mrs. Newsome OVER here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke as with a droll dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>).

<p/>It made his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend--though rather dimly--smile. <div class="bookquote">``Dear no she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s safe,
thank goodness--as I think I more and more feel--at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) thought
of coming, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) gave it up. I've come in a manner instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>);
and come to that extent--for you're right in your inference--on her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
business. So you see there IS plenty of connexion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh continued to see at least all there was. <div class="bookquote">``Involving
accordingly the particular one I've referred to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether took another turn about the room, giving a twitch to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
companion's blanket and finally gaining the door. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feeling was that
of a nurse who had earned personal rest by having made everything
straight. <div class="bookquote">``Involving more things than I can think of breaking ground
on now. But don't be afraid--you shall have them from me: you'll
probably find yourself having quite as much of them as you can do with.
I shall--if we keep together--very much depend on your impression of
some of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh's acknowledgement of this tribute was characteristically
indirect. <div class="bookquote">``You mean to say you don't believe we WILL keep together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only glance at the danger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether paternally said, <div class="bookquote">``because when
I hear you wail to go back I seem to see you open up such possibilities
of folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh took it--silent a little--like a large snubbed child <div class="bookquote">``What are
you going to do with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the very question Strether himself had put to Miss Gostrey, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had sounded like that. But HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at least could be more
definite. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to take you right down to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I've been down to London!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh more softly moaned. <div class="bookquote">``I've no
use, Strether, for anything down there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, good-humouredly, <div class="bookquote">``I guess you've some use for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I've got to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you've got to go further yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh sighed, <div class="bookquote">``do your damnedest! Only you WILL tell me
before you lead me on all the way--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Our friend had again so lost himself, both for amusement and for
contrition, in the wonder of whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had made, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own challenge
that afternoon, such another figure, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for an instant missed the
thread. <div class="bookquote">``Tell you--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why what you've got on hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Why it's such a matter as that even if I
positively wanted I shouldn't be able to keep it from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh gloomily gazed. <div class="bookquote">``What does that mean then but that your trip
is just FOR her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For Mrs. Newsome? Oh it certainly is, as I say. Very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you also say it's for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, in impatience, violently played with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) latch. <div class="bookquote">``It's simple
enough. It's for both of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh at last turned over with a groan. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't marry you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither, when it comes to that--!''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>But the visitor had already laughed
and escaped.



<p/>III

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had told Miss Gostrey he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) should probably take, for departure with
Waymarsh, some afternoon train, and it thereupon in the morning
appeared that this lady had made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own plan for an earlier one. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had breakfasted when Strether came into the coffee-room; but, Waymarsh
not having yet emerged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was in time to recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) to the terms of
their understanding and to pronounce her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) discretion overdone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) was
surely not to break away at the very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had created a want. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) little table in a window, where, with
the morning papers beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) know, of
Major Pendennis breakfasting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) club--a compliment of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
professed a deep appreciation; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) as pleadingly as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had already--and notably under pressure of the visions of the
night--learned to be unable to do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) must teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at
all events, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) went, to order breakfast as breakfast was
ordered in Europe, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) must especially sustain him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in the problem
of ordering for Waymarsh. The latter had laid upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend, by
desperate sounds through the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) room, dreadful divined
responsibilities in respect to beefsteak and oranges--responsibilities
which Miss Gostrey took over with an alertness of action that matched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) quick intelligence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had before this weaned the expatriated
from traditions compared with which the matutinal beefsteak was but the
creature of an hour, and it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), with some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) memories,
to falter in the path though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) freely enough declared, on reflexion,
that there was always in such cases a choice of opposed policies.
<div class="bookquote">``There are times when to give them their head, you know--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>They had gone to wait together in the garden for the dressing of the
meal, and Strether found her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) more suggestive than ever <div class="bookquote">``Well, what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is to bring about for them such a complexity of relations-unless
indeed we call it a simplicity!--that the situation HAS to wind itself
up. They want to go back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you want them to go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether gaily concluded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always want them to go, and I send them as fast as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I know--you take them to Liverpool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any port will serve in a storm. I'm--with all my other functions--an
agent for repatriation. I want to re-people our stricken country. What
will become of it else? I want to discourage others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>The ordered English garden, in the freshness of the day, was
delightful to Strether, who liked the sound, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feet, of the
tight fine gravel, packed with the chronic damp, and who had the idlest
eye for the deep smoothness of turf and the clean curves of paths.
<div class="bookquote">``Other people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Other countries. Other people--yes. I want to encourage our own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Not to come? Why then do you `meet' them--since
it doesn't appear to be to stop them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh that they shouldn't come is as yet too much to ask. What I attend
to is that they come quickly and return still more so. I meet them to
help it to be over as soon as possible, and though I don't stop them
I've my way of putting them through. That's my little system; and, if
you want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>said Maria Gostrey, <div class="bookquote">``it's my real secret, my
innermost mission and use. I only seem, you see, to beguile and
approve; but I've thought it all out and I'm working all the while
underground. I can't perhaps quite give you my formula, but I think
that practically I succeed. I send you back spent. So you stay back.
Passed through my hands--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't turn up again?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The further she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went the further he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) always
saw himself able to follow. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want your formula--I feel quite
enough, as I hinted yesterday, your abysses. Spent!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) echoed. <div class="bookquote">``If
that's how you're arranging so subtly to send me I thank you for the
warning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guests</b></font>)</div><p/>For a minute, amid the pleasantness--poetry in tariffed items, but all
the more, for guests already convicted, a challenge to consumption--they
smiled at each other in confirmed fellowship. <div class="bookquote">``Do you call it subtly?
It's a plain poor tale. Besides, you're a special case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh special cases--that's weak!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was weak enough, further still, to
defer her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) journey and agree to accompany the gentlemen on their own,
might a separate carriage mark her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) independence; though it was in spite
of this to befall after luncheon that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went off alone and that, with
a tryst taken for a day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) company in London, they lingered another
night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had, during the morning--spent in a way that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was to
remember later on as the very climax of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) foretaste, as warm with
presentiments, with what he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would have called collapses--had all sorts
of things out with Strether; and among them the fact that though there
was never a moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) life when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wasn't <div class="bookquote">``due''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>somewhere, there
was yet scarce a perfidy to others of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wasn't capable for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
sake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) explained moreover that wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) happened to be she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
found a dropped thread to pick up, a ragged edge to repair, some
familiar appetite in ambush, jumping out as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) approached, yet
appeasable with a temporary biscuit. It became, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) taking the risk
of the deviation imposed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) insidious arrangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
morning meal, a point of honour for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) not to fail with Waymarsh of
the larger success too; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) subsequent boast to Strether was that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had made their friend fare--and quite without his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knowing what was
the matter--as Major Pendennis would have fared at the Megatherium. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) breakfast like a gentleman, and it was nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
forcibly asserted, to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) would yet make him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
participate in the slow reiterated ramble with which, for Strether, the
new day amply filled itself; and it was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) art that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) somehow had
the air, on the ramparts and in the Rows, of carrying a point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
own.

<p/>The three strolled and stared and gossiped, or at least the two did;
the case really yielding for their comrade, if analysed, but the
element of stricken silence. This element indeed affected Strether as
charged with audible rumblings, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was conscious of the care of
taking it explicitly as a sign of pleasant peace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't appeal
too much, for that provoked stiffness; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't be too freely
tacit, for that suggested giving up. Waymarsh himself adhered to an
ambiguous dumbness that might have represented either the growth of a
perception or the despair of one; and at times and in places--where the
low-browed galleries were darkest, the opposite gables queerest, the
solicitations of every kind densest--the others caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fixing hard
some object of minor interest, fixing even at moments nothing
discernible, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) were indulging it with a truce. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) met
Strether's eye on such occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked guilty and furtive, fell the
next minute into some attitude of retractation. Our friend couldn't
show him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the right things for fear of provoking some total
renouncement, and was tempted even to show him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the wrong in order to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) differ with triumph. There were moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) himself felt
shy of professing the full sweetness of the taste of leisure, and there
were others when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) found himself feeling as if his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) passages of
interchange with the lady at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) side might fall upon the third member
of their party very much as Mr. Burchell, at Dr. Primrose's fireside,
was influenced by the high flights of the visitors from London. The
smallest things so arrested and amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) repeatedly almost
apologised--brought up afresh in explanation his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) plea of a previous
grind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) was aware at the same time that his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) grind had been as
nothing to Waymarsh's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) repeatedly confessed that, to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>)
frivolity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) was doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) best for his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) previous virtue. Do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>)
might, in any case, his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) previous virtue was still there, and it seemed
fairly to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) out of the windows of shops that were not as the
shops of Woollett, fairly to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) want things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) shouldn't
know what to do with. It was by the oddest, the least admissible of
laws demoralising him (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) now; and the way it boldly took was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>)
want more wants. These first walks in Europe were in fact a kind of
finely lurid intimation of what one might find at the end of that
process. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) come back after long years, in something already so
like the evening of life, only to be exposed to it? It was at all
events over the shop-windows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) made, with Waymarsh, most free;
though it would have been easier had not the latter most sensibly
yielded to the appeal of the merely useful trades. He (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>) pierced with his (<font color='blue'><b>Primrose</b></font>)
sombre detachment the plate-glass of ironmongers and saddlers, while
Strether flaunted an affinity with the dealers in stamped letter-paper
and in smart neckties. Strether was in fact recurrently shameless in
the presence of the tailors, though it was just over the heads of the
tailors that his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) countryman most loftily looked. This gave Miss
Gostrey a grasped opportunity to back up Waymarsh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) expense. The
weary lawyer--it was unmistakeable--had a conception of dress; but
that, in view of some of the features of the effect produced, was just
what made the danger of insistence on it. Strether wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) by
this time thought Miss Gostrey less fashionable or Lambert Strether
more so; and it appeared probable that most of the remarks exchanged
between this latter pair about passers, figures, faces, personal types,
exemplified in their degree the disposition to talk as <div class="bookquote">``society''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>talked.

<p/>Was what was happening to himself then, was what already HAD happened,
really that a woman of fashion was floating him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) into society and that
an old friend deserted on the brink was watching the force of the
current? When the woman of fashion permitted Strether--as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at the most--the purchase of a pair of gloves, the terms
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made about it, the prohibition of neckties and other items till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
should be able to guide him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) through the Burlington Arcade, were such as
to fall upon a sensitive ear as a challenge to just imputations. Miss
Gostrey was such a woman of fashion as could make without a symptom of
vulgar blinking an appointment for the Burlington Arcade. Mere
discriminations about a pair of gloves could thus at any rate
represent--always for such sensitive ears as were in
question--possibilities of something that Strether could make a mark
against only as the peril of apparent wantonness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had quite the
consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) new friend, for their companion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might
have had of a Jesuit in petticoats, a representative of the recruiting
interests of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church, for
Waymarsh-that was to say the enemy, the monster of bulging eyes and
far-reaching quivering groping tentacles--was exactly society, exactly
the multiplication of shibboleths, exactly the discrimination of types
and tones, exactly the wicked old Rows of Chester, rank with feudalism;
exactly in short Europe.

<p/>There was light for observation, however, in an incident that occurred
just before they turned back to luncheon. Waymarsh had been for a
quarter of an hour exceptionally mute and distant, and something, or
other--Strether was never to make out exactly what--proved, as it were,
too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comrades had stood for three minutes taking
in, while they leaned on an old balustrade that guarded the edge of the
Row, a particularly crooked and huddled street-view. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thinks us
sophisticated, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thinks us worldly, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thinks us wicked, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thinks us
all sorts of queer things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether reflected; for wondrous were the
vague quantities our friend had within a couple of short days acquired
the habit of conveniently and conclusively lumping together. There
seemed moreover a direct connexion between some such inference and a
sudden grim dash taken by Waymarsh to the opposite side. This movement
was startlingly sudden, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companions at first supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to
have espied, to be pursuing, the glimpse of an acquaintance. They next
made out, however, that an open door had instantly received him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and
they then recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as engulfed in the establishment of a
jeweller, behind whose glittering front he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>) was lost to view. The fact
had somehow the note of a demonstration, and it left each of the others
to show a face almost of fear. But Miss Gostrey broke into a laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) can't stand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then how will that jeweller help him (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether seemed to make it out, from their position, between the
interstices of arrayed watches, of close-hung dangling gewgaws. <div class="bookquote">``You'll
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah that's just what--if he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>) buys anything--I'm afraid of: that I shall

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether studied the finer appearances. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>) may buy everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't you think we ought to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wondered but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Ah what a price to pay! And I was
preparing some for him (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>) so cheap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on, frankly amused now; <div class="bookquote">``don't call it that:
the kind of freedom you deal in is dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Then as to justify himself:
<div class="bookquote">``Am I not in MY way trying it? It's this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Being here, you mean, with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and talking to you as I do. I've known you a few hours, and I've
known HIM all my life; so that if the ease I thus take with you about
him (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>) isn't magnificent'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--and the thought of it held him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a moment--<div class="bookquote">``why
it's rather base.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's magnificent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>said Miss Gostrey to make an end of it. <div class="bookquote">``And you
should hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``the ease I take--and I above all intend to
take--with Mr. Waymarsh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether thought. <div class="bookquote">``About ME? Ah that's no equivalent. The equivalent
would be Waymarsh's himself serving me up--his (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) remorseless analysis of
me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)'ll never do that'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was sadly clear. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)'ll never
remorselessly analyse me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) quite held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) with the authority of
this. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)'ll never say a word to you about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) took it in; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) did it justice; yet after an instant her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) reason,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) restless irony, disposed of it. <div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) won't. For what do
you take people, that they're able to say words about anything, able
remorselessly to analyse? There are not many like you and me. It will
be only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)'s too stupid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>It stirred in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) friend a sceptical echo which was at the same time
the protest of the faith of years. <div class="bookquote">``Waymarsh stupid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Compared with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had still his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes on the jeweller's front, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) waited a
moment to answer. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)'s a success of a kind that I haven't approached.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) has made money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) makes it--to my belief. And I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``though with a back
quite as bent, have never made anything. I'm a perfectly equipped
failure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feared an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)'d ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) meant he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was poor; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was
glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) didn't, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really didn't know to what the truth on this
unpleasant point mightn't have prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) only, however,
confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) assertion. <div class="bookquote">``Thank goodness you're a failure--it's why I
so distinguish you! Anything else to-day is too hideous. Look about
you--look at the successes. Would you BE one, on your honour? Look,
moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For a little accordingly their eyes met. <div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether returned.
<div class="bookquote">``You too are out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The superiority you discern in me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) concurred, <div class="bookquote">``announces my
futility. If you knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) sighed, <div class="bookquote">``the dreams of my youth! But our
realities are what has brought us together. We're beaten brothers in
arms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kindly enough, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't
alter the fact that you're expensive. You've cost me already--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had hung fire. <div class="bookquote">``Cost you what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my past--in one great lump. But no matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) laughed: <div class="bookquote">``I'll
pay with my last penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) attention had unfortunately now been engaged by their comrade's
return, for Waymarsh met their view as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shop. <div class="bookquote">``I
hope he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) hasn't paid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``with HIS (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) last; though I'm convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)
has been splendid, and has been so for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah no--not that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite as little.''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh was by this time near enough to show signs
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend could read, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed to look almost carefully at
nothing in particular.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then for himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For nobody. For nothing. For freedom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what has freedom to do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's answer was indirect. <div class="bookquote">``To be as good as you and me. But
different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had had time to take in their companion's face; and with it, as
such things were easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) took in all. <div class="bookquote">``Different--yes. But
better!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>If Waymarsh was sombre he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was also indeed almost sublime. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) told them
nothing, left his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) absence unexplained, and though they were convinced
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had made some extraordinary purchase they were never to learn its
nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) only glowered grandly at the tops of the old gables. <div class="bookquote">``It's
the sacred rage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether had had further time to say; and this sacred
rage was to become between them, for convenient comprehension, the
description of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) periodical necessities. It was Strether who
eventually contended that it did make him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) better than they. But by
that time Miss Gostrey was convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) didn't want to be better
than Strether.





<p/>Book Second




<p/>I


<p/>Those occasions on which Strether was, in association with the exile
from Milrose, to see the sacred rage glimmer through would doubtless
have their due periodicity; but our friend had meanwhile to find names
for many other matters. On no evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life perhaps, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
reflected, had he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had to supply so many as on the third of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) short
stay in London; an evening spent by Miss Gostrey's side at one of the
theatres, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had found himself transported, without his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own
hand raised, on the mere expression of a conscientious wonder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) theatre, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) play, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had triumphantly known,
three days running, everything else, and the moment filled to the brim,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) companion, that apprehension of the interesting which, whether
or no the interesting happened to filter through his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) guide, strained
now to its limits his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) brief opportunity. Waymarsh hadn't come with
them; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had seen plays enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) signified, before Strether had
joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--an affirmation that had its full force when his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend
ascertained by questions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had seen two and a circus. Questions
as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had seen had on him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) indeed an effect only less favourable
than questions as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) liked the former to be
discriminated; but how could it be done, Strether asked of their
constant counsellor, without discriminating the latter?

<p/>Miss Gostrey had dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hotel, face to face over a small
table on which the lighted candles had rose-coloured shades; and the
rose-coloured shades and the small table and the soft fragrance of the
lady--had anything to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mere sense ever been so soft?--were so many
touches in he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) scarce knew what positive high picture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been to
the theatre, even to the opera, in Boston, with Mrs. Newsome, more than
once acting as her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) only escort; but there had been no little confronted
dinner, no pink lights, no whiff of vague sweetness, as a preliminary:
one of the results of which was that at present, mildly rueful, though
with a sharpish accent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) actually asked himself WHY there hadn't.
There was much the same difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) impression of the noticed
state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion, whose dress was <div class="bookquote">``cut down,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) believed the
term to be, in respect to shoulders and bosom, in a manner quite other
than Mrs. Newsome's, and who wore round her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) throat a broad red velvet
band with an antique jewel--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was rather complacently sure it was
antique--attached to it in front. Mrs. Newsome's dress was never in
any degree <div class="bookquote">``cut down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Newsome</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) never wore round her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) throat a broad red
velvet band: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had, moreover, would it ever have served so to
carry on and complicate, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now almost felt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) vision?

<p/>It would have been absurd of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to trace into ramifications the effect
of the ribbon from which Miss Gostrey's trinket depended, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) not
for the hour, at the best, been so given over to uncontrolled
perceptions. What was it but an uncontrolled perception that his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
friend's velvet band somehow added, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) appearance, to the value of
every other item--to that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) smile and of the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
head, to that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) complexion, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) lips, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) teeth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
hair? What, certainly, had a man conscious of a man's work in the
world to do with red velvet bands? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't for anything have so
exposed himself as to tell Miss Gostrey how much he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked hers, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
HAD none the less not only caught himself in the act--frivolous, no
doubt, idiotic, and above all unexpected--of liking it: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in
addition taken it as a starting-point for fresh backward, fresh
forward, fresh lateral flights. The manner in which Mrs. Newsome's
throat WAS encircled suddenly represented for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in an alien order,
almost as many things as the manner in which Miss Gostrey's was. Mrs.
Newsome wore, at operatic hours, a black silk dress--very handsome, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knew it was <div class="bookquote">``handsome'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and an ornament that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory was able
further to identify as a ruche. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) association indeed with the
ruche, but it was rather imperfectly romantic. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once said to the
wearer--and it was as <div class="bookquote">``free''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>a remark as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)--that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) looked, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) ruff and other matters, like Queen Elizabeth; and
it had after this in truth been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancy that, as a consequence of
that tenderness and an acceptance of the idea, the form of this special
tribute to the <div class="bookquote">``frill''  (<font color='red'><b>Queen Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>had grown slightly more marked. The connexion,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat there and let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imagination roam, was to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as
vaguely pathetic; but there it all was, and pathetic was doubtless in
the conditions the best thing it could possibly be. It had assuredly
existed at any rate; for it seemed now to come over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that no
gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) age at Woollett could ever, to a lady of Mrs.
Newsome's, which was not much less than his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), have embarked on such a
simile.

<p/>All sorts of things in fact now seemed to come over him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), comparatively
few of which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chronicler can hope for space to mention. It came
over him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for instance that Miss Gostrey looked perhaps like Mary
Stuart: Lambert Strether had a candour of fancy which could rest for
an instant gratified in such an antithesis. It came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that
never before--no, literally never--had a lady dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at a
public place before going to the play. The publicity of the place was
just, in the matter, for Strether, the rare strange thing; it affected
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost as the achievement of privacy might have affected a man of a
different experience. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had married, in the far-away years, so young
as to have missed the time natural in Boston for taking girls to the
Museum; and it was absolutely true of hint that--even after the close
of the period of conscious detachment occupying the centre of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life,
the grey middle desert of the two deaths, that of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and that,
ten years later, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boy--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never taken any one anywhere. It
came over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in especial--though the monition had, as happened,
already sounded, fitfully gleamed, in other forms--that the business he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had come out on hadn't yet been so brought home to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as by the sight
of the people about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the impression, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, at
first, more straight than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got it for himself--gave it simply by
saying with off-hand illumination: <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, they're types!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--but after
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made to the full his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own use of it; both while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
kept silence for the four acts and while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked in the intervals. It
was an evening, it was a world of types, and this was a connexion above
all in which the figures and faces in the stalls were interchangeable
with those on the stage.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt as if the play itself penetrated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the naked elbow of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour, a great stripped handsome red-haired lady who conversed
with a gentleman on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) other side in stray dissyllables which had for
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ear, in the oddest way in the world, so much sound that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wondered
they hadn't more sense; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) recognised by the same law, beyond the
footlights, what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was pleased to take for the very flush of English
life. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had distracted drops in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) couldn't have said if it
were actors or auditors who were most true, and the upshot of which,
each time, was the consciousness of new contacts. However he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) viewed
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) job it was <div class="bookquote">``types''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should have to tackle. Those before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and
around him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were not as the types of Woollett, where, for that matter,
it had begun to seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that there must only have been the male and
the female. These made two exactly, even with the individual varieties.
Here, on the other hand, apart from the personal and the sexual
range--which might be greater or less--a series of strong stamps had
been applied, as it were, from without; stamps that his (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) observation
played with as, before a glass case on a table, it might have passed
from medal to medal and from copper to gold. It befell that in the
drama precisely there was a bad woman in a yellow frock who made a
pleasant weak good-looking young man in perpetual evening dress do the
most dreadful things. Strether felt himself on the whole not afraid of
the yellow frock, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was vaguely anxious over a certain kindness
into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found himself drifting for its victim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't come
out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) reminded himself, to be too kind, or indeed to be kind at all,
to Chadwick Newsome. Would Chad also be in perpetual evening dress?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) somehow rather hoped it--it seemed so to add to THIS young man's
general amenability; though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered too if, to fight him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own weapons, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself -LRB-a thought almost startling-RRB- would have
likewise to be. This young man furthermore would have been much more
easy to handle--at least for HIM--than appeared probable in respect to
Chad.

<p/>It came up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) with Miss Gostrey that there were things of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) would really perhaps after all have heard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) admitted when a
little pressed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was never quite sure of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) heard as
distinguished from things such as, on occasions like the present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
only extravagantly guessed. <div class="bookquote">``I seem with this freedom, you see, to
have guessed Mr. Chad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s a young man on whose head high hopes are
placed at Woollett; a young man a wicked woman has got hold of and whom
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family over there have sent you out to rescue. You've accepted the
mission of separating him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the wicked woman. Are you quite sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s very bad for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) manner showed it as quite pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
we are. Wouldn't YOU be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I don't know. One never does--does one?--beforehand. One can only
judge on the facts. Yours are quite new to me; I'm really not in the
least, as you see, in possession of them: so it will be awfully
interesting to have them from you. If you're satisfied, that's all
that's required. I mean if you're sure you ARE sure: sure it won't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) should lead such a life? Rather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but I don't know, you see, about his (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) life; you've not told me about
his (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may be charming--his (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charming?'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether stared before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s base, venal-out of the
streets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. And HE (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>)--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chad, wretched boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what type and temper is he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went on as Strether had lapsed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--the obstinate.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was as if for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been going to
say more and had then controlled himself.

<p/>That was scarce what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wished. <div class="bookquote">``Do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was prompt. <div class="bookquote">``No. How CAN I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean because of your being so saddled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether after a moment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has
darkened her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) admirable life.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke with austerity. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has
worried her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) half to death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh that's of course odious.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had a pause as if for renewed
emphasis of this truth, but it ended on another note. <div class="bookquote">``Is her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life
very admirable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Extraordinarily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>There was so much in the tone that Miss Gostrey had to devote another
pause to the appreciation of it. <div class="bookquote">``And has he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) only HER? I don't mean
the bad woman in Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) quickly added--<div class="bookquote">``for I assure you I
shouldn't even at the best be disposed to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) more than one. But
has he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) only his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has also a sister, older than himself and married; and they're both
remarkably fine women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very handsome, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This promptitude--almost, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might have thought, this precipitation,
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a brief drop; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came up again. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Newsome, I think, is
handsome, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s not of course, with a son of twenty-eight and a
daughter of thirty, in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) very first youth. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) married, however,
extremely young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey asked, <div class="bookquote">``for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) age?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether seemed to feel with a certain disquiet the pressure of it. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't say she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s wonderful. Or rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on the next moment, <div class="bookquote">``I
do say it. It's exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) IS--wonderful. But I wasn't thinking
of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) appearance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) explained--<div class="bookquote">``striking as that doubtless is. I
was thinking--well, of many other things.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed to look at these
as if to mention some of them; then took, pulling himself up, another
turn. <div class="bookquote">``About Mrs. Pocock people may differ.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the daughter's name--`Pocock'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the daughter's name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether sturdily confessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And people may differ, you mean, about HER beauty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But YOU admire her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend a glance as to show how he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could bear this <div class="bookquote">``I'm
perhaps a little afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>said Miss Gostrey, <div class="bookquote">``I see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) from here! You may say then I see
very fast and very far, but I've already shown you I do. The young man
and the two ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``are at any rate all the family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite all. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father has been dead ten years, and there's no
brother, nor any other sister. They'd do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``anything in
the world for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'd do anything in the world for THEM?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shifted again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had made it perhaps just a shade too affirmative
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nerves. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I don't know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd do at any rate this, and the `anything' they'd do is represented
by their MAKING you do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah they couldn't have come--either of them. They're very busy people
and Mrs. Newsome in particular has a large full life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s moreover
highly nervous--and not at all strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s an American invalid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) carefully distinguished. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) likes less than to be
called one, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) would consent to be one of those things, I think,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``if it were the only way to be the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Consent to be an American in order to be an invalid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``the other way round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s at any rate delicate
sensitive high-strung. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) puts so much of herself into everything--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah Maria knew these things! <div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) has nothing left for anything
else? Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hasn't. To whom do you say it? High-strung?
Don't I spend my life, for them, jamming down the pedal? I see
moreover how it has told on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether took this more lightly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I jam down the pedal too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) lucidly returned, <div class="bookquote">``we must from this moment bear on it
together with all our might.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) forged ahead. <div class="bookquote">``Have they money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was as if, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) energetic image still held him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) enquiry
fell short. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Newsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wished further to explain, <div class="bookquote">``hasn't
moreover your courage on the question of contact. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had come it
would have been to see the person herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The woman? Ah but that's courage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--it's exaltation, which is a very different thing. Courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>),
however, accommodatingly threw out, <div class="bookquote">``is what YOU have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You say that only to patch me up--to cover the
nudity of my want of exaltation. I've neither the one nor the other.
I've mere battered indifference. I see that what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss
Gostrey pursued, <div class="bookquote">``is that if your friend HAD come she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would take great
views, and the great views, to put it simply, would be too much for
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether looked amused at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) notion of the simple, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) adopted her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
formula. <div class="bookquote">``Everything's too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then such a service as this of yours--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is more for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) than anything else? Yes--far more. But so long as it
isn't too much for ME--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) condition doesn't matter? Surely not; we leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) condition out;
we take it, that is, for granted. I see it, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) condition, as behind
and beneath you; yet at the same time I see it as bearing you up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh it does bear me up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then as yours bears ME nothing more's needed.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
put again her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``Has Mrs. Newsome money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) heeded. <div class="bookquote">``Oh plenty. That's the root of the evil. There's
money, to very large amounts, in the concern. Chad has had the free
use of a great deal. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'ll pull himself together and come home,
all the same, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'ll find his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) account in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had listened with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) interest. <div class="bookquote">``And I hope to goodness you'll
find yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'ll take up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) definite material reward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether without
acknowledgement of this. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s at the parting of the ways. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) can
come into the business now--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) can't come later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there a business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, yes--a big brave bouncing business. A roaring trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great shop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--a workshop; a great production, a great industry. The concern's
a manufacture--and a manufacture that, if it's only properly looked
after, may well be on the way to become a monopoly. It's a little thing
they make--make better, it appears, than other people can, or than
other people, at any rate, do. Mr. Newsome, being a man of ideas, at
least in that particular line,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether explained, <div class="bookquote">``put them on it
with great effect, and gave the place altogether, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) time, an
immense lift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a place in itself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, quite a number of buildings; almost a little industrial colony.
But above all it's a thing. The article produced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what IS the article produced?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as in slight reluctance to say; then the
curtain, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw about to rise, came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) aid. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you
next time.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But when the next time came he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) only said he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)'d tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
later on--after they should have left the theatre; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had
immediately reverted to their topic, and even for himself the picture
of the stage was now overlaid with another image. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) postponements,
however, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wonder--wonder if the article referred to were
anything bad. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) explained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) meant improper or ridiculous
or wrong. But Strether, so far as that went, could satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Unmentionable? Oh no, we constantly talk of it; we are quite familiar
and brazen about it. Only, as a small, trivial, rather ridiculous
object of the commonest domestic use, it's just wanting in-what shall I
say? Well, dignity, or the least approach to distinction. Right here
therefore, with everything about us so grand--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In short he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shrank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a false note?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sadly. It's vulgar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely not vulgarer than this.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondering as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
herself had done: <div class="bookquote">``Than everything about us.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) seemed a trifle
irritated. <div class="bookquote">``What do you take this for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why for--comparatively--divine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This dreadful London theatre? It's impossible, if you really want to
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>laughed Strether, ``I DON<div class="bookquote">``T really want to know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It made between them a pause, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), however, still fascinated by
the mystery of the production at Woollett, presently broke. <div class="bookquote">''`Rather
ridiculous'? Clothes-pins? Saleratus? Shoe-polish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) round. ``No--you don't even ``burn.<div class="bookquote">'' I don't think, you
know, you'll guess it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How then can I judge how vulgar it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll judge when I do tell you'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) to patience.
But it may even now frankly be mentioned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in the sequel never
WAS to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) actually never did so, and it moreover oddly
occurred that by the law, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), of the incalculable, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) desire
for the information dropped and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) attitude to the question converted
itself into a positive cultivation of ignorance. In ignorance she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
could humour her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) fancy, and that proved a useful freedom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) could
treat the little nameless object as indeed unnameable--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) could make
their abstention enormously definite. There might indeed have been for
Strether the portent of this in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) next said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it perhaps then because it's so bad--because your industry as you
call it, IS so vulgar--that Mr. Chad won't come back? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) feel the
taint? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) staying away not to be mixed up in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed, <div class="bookquote">``it wouldn't appear--would it?--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) feels
`taints'! He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s glad enough of the money from it, and the money's his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
whole basis. There's appreciation in that--I mean as to the allowance
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother has hitherto made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has of course the resource of
cutting this allowance off; but even then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has unfortunately, and on
no small scale, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) independent supply--money left him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
grandfather, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't the fact you mention then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey asked, <div class="bookquote">``make it just
more easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to be particular? Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) conceivable as fastidious
about the source--the apparent and public source--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) income?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether was able quite good-humouredly to entertain the proposition.
<div class="bookquote">``The source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) grandfather's wealth--and thereby of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own share
in it--was not particularly noble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what source was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether cast about. <div class="bookquote">``Well--practices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In business? Infamies? He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was an old swindler?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said with more emphasis than spirit, <div class="bookquote">``I shan't describe HIM
nor narrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) exploits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, what abysses! And the late Mr. Newsome then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) like the grandfather?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was on the other side of the house. And he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey kept it up. <div class="bookquote">``Better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) friend for a moment hung fire. <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) comment on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hesitation was scarce the less marked for being
mute. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. NOW don't you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``why the boy
doesn't come home? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s drowning his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shame? What shame?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shame? Comment donc? THE shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But where and when,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked, ``is <div class="bookquote">``THE shame'--where is any
shame--to-day? The men I speak of--they did as every one does; and
-LRB-besides being ancient history-RRB- it was all a matter of appreciation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) showed how she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) understood. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Newsome has appreciated?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah I can't speak for HER!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the midst of such doings--and, as I understand you, profiting by
them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) at least has remained exquisite?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I can't talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said.

<p/>``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was just what you COULD talk of. You DON<div class="bookquote">``T trust me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey after a moment declared.

<p/>It had its effect. <div class="bookquote">``Well, her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) money is spent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) life conceived and
carried on with a large beneficence--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a kind of expiation of wrongs? Gracious,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) added before he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
could speak, <div class="bookquote">``how intensely you make me see her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether dropped, <div class="bookquote">``it's all that's necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) really seemed to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I feel that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) IS, in spite of
everything, handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>This at least enlivened him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by everything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I mean YOU.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) swift changes of
ground. <div class="bookquote">``You say the concern needs looking after; but doesn't Mrs.
Newsome look after it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So far as possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s wonderfully able, but it's not her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) affair,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) life's a good deal overcharged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) has many, many things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you also?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--I've many too, if you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. But what I mean is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey amended, <div class="bookquote">``do you also look
after the business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I don't touch the business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only everything else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes--some things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As for instance--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether obligingly thought. <div class="bookquote">``Well, the Review.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Review?--you have a Review?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. Woollett has a Review--which Mrs. Newsome, for the most
part, magnificently pays for and which I, not at all magnificently,
edit. My name's on the cover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether pursued, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm really
rather disappointed and hurt that you seem never to have heard of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) neglected for a moment this grievance. <div class="bookquote">``And what kind of a Review
is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) serenity was now completely restored. <div class="bookquote">``Well, it's green.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean in political colour as they say here--in thought?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I mean the cover's green--of the most lovely shade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And with Mrs. Newsome's name on it too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) waited a little. <div class="bookquote">``Oh as for that you must judge if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) peeps out.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s behind the whole thing; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s of a delicacy and a
discretion--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey took it all. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) WOULD be. I don't underrate
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) must be rather a swell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s rather a swell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Woollett swell--bon! I like the idea of a Woollett swell. And you
must be rather one too, to be so mixed up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``that's not the way it works.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had already taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``The way it works--you needn't tell
me!--is of course that you efface yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With my name on the cover?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lucidly objected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but you don't put it on for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon--that's exactly what I do put it on for. It's
exactly the thing that I'm reduced to doing for myself. It seems to
rescue a little, you see, from the wreck of hopes and ambitions, the
refuse-heap of disappointments and failures, my one presentable little
scrap of an identity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On this she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as to say many things, but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) at last
simply said was: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) likes to see it there. You're the bigger swell
of the two,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) immediately continued, <div class="bookquote">``because you think you're not
one. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) IS one. However,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey added, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
thinks you're one too. You're at all events the biggest she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) can get
hold of.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) embroidered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) abounded. <div class="bookquote">``I don't say it to interfere
between you, but on the day she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) gets hold of a bigger one--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether
had thrown back his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head as in silent mirth over something that struck
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) audacity or felicity, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) flight meanwhile was already
higher. <div class="bookquote">``Therefore close with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Close with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) seemed to hang poised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before you lose your chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes met over it. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by closing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do I mean by your chance? I'll tell you when you tell me all
the things YOU don't. Is it her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) GREATEST fad?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) briskly pursued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Review?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed to wonder how he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could best describe it. This
resulted however but in a sketch. <div class="bookquote">``It's her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) tribute to the ideal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. You go in for tremendous things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We go in for the unpopular side--that is so far as we dare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how far DO you dare?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) very far. I much less. I don't begin to have her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) faith.
She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) provides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``three fourths of that. And she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
provides, as I've confided to you, ALL the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It evoked somehow a vision of gold that held for a little Miss
Gostrey's eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) heard the bright dollars
shovelled in. <div class="bookquote">``I hope then you make a good thing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I NEVER made a good thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at once returned.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) just waited. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you call it a good thing to be loved?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh we're not loved. We're not even hated. We're only just sweetly
ignored.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had another pause. <div class="bookquote">``You don't trust me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) once more repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I when I lift the last veil?--tell you the very secret of the
prison-house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes, but to the result that after an instant her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) own
turned away with impatience. <div class="bookquote">``You don't sell? Oh I'm glad of THAT!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After which however, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could protest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was off again.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'s just a MORAL swell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) accepted gaily enough the definition. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I really think that
describes her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>But it had for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend the oddest connexion. <div class="bookquote">``How does she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) do her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
hair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) laughed out. <div class="bookquote">``Beautifully!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah that doesn't tell me. However, it doesn't matter--I know. It's
tremendously neat--a real reproach; quite remarkably thick and without,
as yet, a single strand of white. There!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) blushed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) realism, but gaped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) truth. <div class="bookquote">``You're the very
deuce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else SHOULD I be? It was as the very deuce I pounced on you. But
don't let it trouble you, for everything but the very deuce--at our
age--is a bore and a delusion, and even he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) himself, after all, but half
a joy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which, on a single sweep of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) resumed. <div class="bookquote">``You
assist her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to expiate--which is rather hard when you've yourself not
sinned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) who hasn't sinned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether replied. <div class="bookquote">``I've sinned the most.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey cynically laughed, <div class="bookquote">``what a picture of HER! Have you
robbed the widow and the orphan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've sinned enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough for whom? Enough for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to be where I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>They were disturbed at this moment by the passage between
their knees and the back of the seats before them of a gentleman who
had been absent during a part of the performance and who now returned
for the close; but the interruption left Miss Gostrey time, before the
subsequent hush, to express as a sharp finality her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) sense of the moral
of all their talk. <div class="bookquote">``I knew you had something up your sleeve!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This
finality, however, left them in its turn, at the end of the play, as
disposed to hang back as if they had still much to say; so that they
easily agreed to let every one go before them--they found an interest
in waiting. They made out from the lobby that the night had turned to
rain; yet Miss Gostrey let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) friend know that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wasn't to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
home. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was simply to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), by herself, into a four-wheeler; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
liked so in London, of wet nights after wild pleasures, thinking things
over, on the return, in lonely four-wheelers. This was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) great time,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) intimated, for pulling herself together. The delays caused by the
weather, the struggle for vehicles at the door, gave them occasion to
subside on a divan at the back of the vestibule and just beyond the
reach of the fresh damp gusts from the street. Here Strether's comrade
resumed that free handling of the subject to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own imagination
of it already owed so much. <div class="bookquote">``Does your young friend in Paris like you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It had almost, after the interval, startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh I hope not! Why
SHOULD he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey asked. <div class="bookquote">``That you're coming down on
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) need have nothing to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see more in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) presently returned, <div class="bookquote">``than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I see you in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then you see more in `me'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Than you see in yourself? Very likely. That's always one's right.
What I was thinking of,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``is the possible particular
effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) milieu.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) milieu--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether really felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could imagine it better now
than three hours before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean it can only have been so lowering?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why that's my very starting-point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you start so far back. What do his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) letters say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) practically ignores us--or spares us. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) doesn't write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. But there are all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``two quite distinct
things that--given the wonderful place he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s in--may have happened to
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). One is that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may have got brutalised. The other is that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may
have got refined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether stared--this WAS a novelty. <div class="bookquote">``Refined?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``there ARE refinements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The way of it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), after looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), break into a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``YOU
have them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As one of the signs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) continued in the same tone, <div class="bookquote">``they constitute
perhaps the worst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thought it over and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gravity returned. <div class="bookquote">``Is it a refinement not
to answer his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother's letters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) appeared to have a scruple, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) brought it out. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I should
say the greatest of all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``I'M quite content to let it, as one of the
signs, pass for the worst that I know he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) believes he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) can do what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
likes with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>This appeared to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How do you know it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I'm sure of it. I feel it in my bones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Feel he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) CAN do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) believes he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) can. It may come to the same thing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wouldn't, however, have this. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing for you will ever come to
the same thing as anything else.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) understood what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) meant,
it seemed, sufficiently to go straight on. <div class="bookquote">``You say that if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does
break he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll come in for things at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Quite positively. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll come in for a particular chance--a chance
that any properly constituted young man would jump at. The business
has so developed that an opening scarcely apparent three years ago, but
which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's will took account of as in certain conditions
possible and which, under that will, attaches to Chad's availing
himself of it a large contingent advantage--this opening, the
conditions having come about, now simply awaits him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother has
kept it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), holding out against strong pressure, till the last
possible moment. It requires, naturally, as it carries with it a
handsome ``part,<div class="bookquote">'' a large share in profits, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) being on the spot and
making a big effort for a big result. That's what I mean by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) chance.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) misses it he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comes in, as you say, for nothing. And to see that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) doesn't miss it is, in a word, what I've come out for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) let it all sink in. <div class="bookquote">``What you've come out for then is simply to
render him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) an immense service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, poor Strether was willing to take it so. <div class="bookquote">``Ah if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) stands, as they say, if you succeed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), to gain--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh a lot of advantages.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether had them clearly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fingers'
ends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By which you mean of course a lot of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, not only. I'm acting with a sense for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) of other things too.
Consideration and comfort and security--the general safety of being
anchored by a strong chain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wants, as I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), to be protected.
Protected I mean from life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah voila!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) thought fitted with a click. <div class="bookquote">``From life. What you
REALLY want to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) home for is to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's about the size of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's rudimentary. But to any one in
particular?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smiled at this, looking a little more conscious. <div class="bookquote">``You get
everything out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment again their eyes met. <div class="bookquote">``You put everything in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) acknowledged the tribute by telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``To Mamie Pocock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wondered; then gravely, even exquisitely, as if to make the oddity
also fit: <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own niece?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you must yourself find a name for the relation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
brother-in-law's sister. Mrs. Jim's sister-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to have on Miss Gostrey a certain hardening effect. <div class="bookquote">``And who
in the world's Mrs. Jim?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chad's sister--who was Sarah Newsome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s married--didn't I mention
it?--to Jim Pocock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) tacitly replied; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had mentioned things--! Then,
however, with all the sound it could have, <div class="bookquote">``Who in the world's Jim
Pocock?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why Sally's husband. That's the only way we distinguish people at
Woollett,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) good-humoredly explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is it a great distinction--being Sally's husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) considered. <div class="bookquote">``I think there can be scarcely a greater--unless it may
become one, in the future, to be Chad's wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then how do they distinguish YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``They DON<div class="bookquote">``T--except, as I've told you, by the green cover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more their eyes met on it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) an instant. <div class="bookquote">``The
green cover won't--nor will ANY cover--avail you with ME. You're of a
depth of duplicity!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) could in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) own large grasp of the
real condone it. <div class="bookquote">``Is Mamie a great parti?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh the greatest we have--our prettiest brightest girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey seemed to fix the poor child. <div class="bookquote">``I know what they CAN be.
And with money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Not perhaps with a great deal of that--but with so much of everything
else that we don't miss it. We DON``T miss money much, you know,''
Strether added, <div class="bookquote">``in general, in America, in pretty girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) conceded; <div class="bookquote">``but I know also what you do sometimes miss. And do
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``yourself admire her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) indicated, that there might be several ways of
taking; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) decided after an instant for the humorous. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't I
sufficiently showed you how I admire ANY pretty girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) problem was by this time such that it scarce left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) freedom, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kept close to the facts. <div class="bookquote">``I supposed that at
Woollett you wanted them--what shall I call it?--blameless. I mean
your young men for your pretty girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So did I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether confessed. <div class="bookquote">``But you strike there a curious
fact--the fact that Woollett too accommodates itself to the spirit of
the age and the increasing mildness of manners. Everything changes,
and I hold that our situation precisely marks a date. We SHOULD prefer
them blameless, but we have to make the best of them as we find them.
Since the spirit of the age and the increasing mildness send them so
much more to Paris--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've to take them back as they come. When they DO come. Bon!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Once
more she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) embraced it all, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had a moment of thought. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Chad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether cheerfully <div class="bookquote">``Mamie will save him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was looking away, still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) vision, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) spoke with
impatience and almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``YOU'LL save
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). That's who'll save him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but with Mamie's aid. Unless indeed you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that I
shall effect so much more with yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) at last again look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You'll do more--as you're so
much better--than all of us put together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'm only better since I've known YOU!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether bravely
returned.

<p/>The depletion of the place, the shrinkage of the crowd and now
comparatively quiet withdrawal of its last elements had already brought
them nearer the door and put them in relation with a messenger of whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) bespoke Miss Gostrey's cab. But this left them a few minutes more,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was clearly in no mood not to use. <div class="bookquote">``You've spoken to me of
what--by your success--Mr. Chad stands to gain. But you've not spoken
to me of what you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I've nothing more to gain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether very simply.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) took it as even quite too simple. <div class="bookquote">``You mean you've got it all
`down'? You've been paid in advance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah don't talk about payment!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) groaned.

<p/>Something in the tone of it pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) up, but as their messenger still
delayed she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had another chance and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) put it in another way. <div class="bookquote">``What--by
failure--do you stand to lose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) still, however, wouldn't have it. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) exclaimed, and on
the messenger's at this instant reappearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was able to sink the
subject in their responsive advance. When, a few steps up the street,
under a lamp, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) four-wheeler and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) if the man had called for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no second conveyance, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied
before the door was closed. <div class="bookquote">``You won't take me with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the rain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like the rain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a moment, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand was on the door, by not
answering; after which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) answered by repeating her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``What do
you stand to lose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Why the question now affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as other he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) couldn't have said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
could only this time meet it otherwise. <div class="bookquote">``Everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I thought. Then you shall succeed. And to that end I'm yours--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, dear lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) kindly breathed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Till death!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>said Maria Gostrey. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>II


<p/>Strether called, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) second morning in Paris, on the bankers of the Rue
Scribe to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Scribe</b></font>) letter of credit was addressed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scribe</b></font>) made this
visit attended by Waymarsh, in whose company he (<font color='blue'><b>Scribe</b></font>) had crossed from London
two days before. They had hastened to the Rue Scribe on the morrow of
their arrival, but Strether had not then found the letters the hope of
which prompted this errand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had had as yet none at all; hadn't
expected them in London, but had counted on several in Paris, and,
disconcerted now, had presently strolled back to the Boulevard with a
sense of injury that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt himself taking for as good a start as any
other. It would serve, this spur to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spirit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) reflected, as,
pausing at the top of the street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked up and down the great
foreign avenue, it would serve to begin business with. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) idea was to
begin business immediately, and it did much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) day
that the beginning of business awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) did little else till
night but ask himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should do if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't fortunately had so
much to do; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put himself the question in many different
situations and connexions. What carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hither and yon was an
admirable theory that nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could do wouldn't be in some manner
related to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fundamentally had on hand, or WOULD be--should he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
happen to have a scruple--wasted for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) did happen to have a
scruple--a scruple about taking no definite step till he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should get
letters; but this reasoning carried it off. A single day to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
feet--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had felt them as yet only at Chester and in London--was he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
could consider, none too much; and having, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had often privately
expressed it, Paris to reckon with, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) threw these hours of freshness
consciously into the reckoning. They made it continually greater, but
that was what it had best be if it was to be anything at all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
gave himself up till far into the evening, at the theatre and on the
return, after the theatre, along the bright congested Boulevard, to
feeling it grow. Waymarsh had accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) this time to the play,
and the two men had walked together, as a first stage, from the Gymnase
to the Cafe Riche, into the crowded <div class="bookquote">``terrace''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>of which
establishment--the night, or rather the morning, for midnight had
struck, being bland and populous--they had wedged themselves for
refreshment. Waymarsh, as a result of some discussion with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend,
had made a marked virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) having now let himself go; and there
had been elements of impression in their half-hour over their watered
beer-glasses that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) occasion for conveying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) held this
compromise with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stiffer self to have become extreme. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) conveyed
it--for it was still, after all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stiffer self who gloomed out of
the glare of the terrace--in solemn silence; and there was indeed a
great deal of critical silence, every way, between the companions, even
till they gained the Place de l``Opera, as to the character of their
nocturnal progress.

<p/>This morning there WERE letters--letters which had reached London,
apparently all together, the day of Strether's journey, and had taken
their time to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); so that, after a controlled impulse to go
into them in the reception-room of the bank, which, reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) of
the post-office at Woollett, affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as the abutment of some
transatlantic bridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) slipped them into the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) loose grey
overcoat with a sense of the felicity of carrying them off. Waymarsh,
who had had letters yesterday, had had them again to-day, and Waymarsh
suggested in this particular no controlled impulses. The last one he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
was at all events likely to be observed to struggle with was clearly
that of bringing to a premature close any visit to the Rue Scribe.
Strether had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) there yesterday; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted to see the papers, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had spent, by what his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend could make out, a succession of hours
with the papers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke of the establishment, with emphasis, as a
post of superior observation; just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke generally of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) actual
damnable doom as a device for hiding from him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) what was going on. Europe
was best described, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mind, as an elaborate engine for
dissociating the confined American from that indispensable knowledge,
and was accordingly only rendered bearable by these occasional stations
of relief, traps for the arrest of wandering western airs. Strether,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) side, set himself to walk again--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) relief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
pocket; and indeed, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had desired his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) budget, the growth of
restlessness might have been marked in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
assured himself of the superscription of most of the missives it
contained. This restlessness became therefore his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) temporary law; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should recognise as soon as see it the best place of all for
settling down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) chief correspondent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had for the next hour
an accidental air of looking for it in the windows of shops; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came
down the Rue de la Paix in the sun and, passing across the Tuileries
and the river, indulged more than once--as if on finding himself
determined--in a sudden pause before the book-stalls of the opposite
quay. In the garden of the Tuileries he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had lingered, on two or three
spots, to look; it was as if the wonderful Paris spring had stayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) roamed. The prompt Paris morning struck its cheerful notes--in a
soft breeze and a sprinkled smell, in the light flit, over the
garden-floor, of bareheaded girls with the buckled strap of oblong
boxes, in the type of ancient thrifty persons basking betimes where
terrace-walls were warm, in the blue-frocked brass-labelled officialism
of humble rakers and scrapers, in the deep references of a
straight-pacing priest or the sharp ones of a white-gaitered red-legged
soldier. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) watched little brisk figures, figures whose movement was
as the tick of the great Paris clock, take their smooth diagonal from
point to point; the air had a taste as of something mixed with art,
something that presented nature as a white-capped master-chef. The
palace was gone, Strether remembered the palace; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gazed into
the irremediable void of its site the historic sense in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might have
been freely at play--the play under which in Paris indeed it so often
winces like a touched nerve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) filled out spaces with dim symbols of
scenes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) caught the gleam of white statues at the base of which, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) letters out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could tilt back a straw-bottomed chair. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
drift was, for reasons, to the other side, and it floated him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) unspent
up the Rue de Seine and as far as the Luxembourg. In the Luxembourg
Gardens he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pulled up; here at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nook, and here, on a
penny chair from which terraces, alleys, vistas, fountains, little
trees in green tubs, little women in white caps and shrill little girls
at play all sunnily <div class="bookquote">``composed''  (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div>together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) passed an hour in which the
cup of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) impressions seemed truly to overflow. But a week had elapsed
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) quitted the ship, and there were more things in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mind than
so few days could account for. More than once, during the time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
regarded himself as admonished; but the admonition this morning was
formidably sharp. It took as it hadn't done yet the form of a
question--the question of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was doing with such an extraordinary
sense of escape. This sense was sharpest after he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had read his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
letters, but that was also precisely why the question pressed. Four of
the letters were from Mrs. Newsome and none of them short; she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had lost
no time, had followed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) heels while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) moved, so expressing
herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now could measure the probable frequency with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
should hear. They would arrive, it would seem, her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) communications, at
the rate of several a week; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should be able to count, it might even
prove, on more than one by each mail. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had begun yesterday with a
small grievance he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had therefore an opportunity to begin to-day with
its opposite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) read the letters successively and slowly, putting
others back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pocket but keeping these for a long time
afterwards gathered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) held them there, lost in thought,
as if to prolong the presence of what they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); or as if at the
least to assure them their part in the constitution of some lucidity.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend wrote admirably, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) tone was even more in her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) style
than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) voice--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might almost, for the hour, have had to come this
distance to get its full carrying quality; yet the plentitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
consciousness of difference consorted perfectly with the deepened
intensity of the connexion. It was the difference, the difference of
being just where he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was and AS he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was, that formed the escape--this
difference was so much greater than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had dreamed it would be; and
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) finally sat there turning over was the strange logic of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
finding himself so free. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt it in a manner his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) duty to think out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) state, to approve the process, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came in fact to trace
the steps and add up the items they sufficiently accounted for the sum.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never expected--that was the truth of it--again to find himself
young, and all the years and other things it had taken to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) so
were exactly his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) present arithmetic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had to make sure of them to
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) scruple to rest.

<p/>It all sprang at bottom from the beauty of Mrs. Newsome's desire that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should be worried with nothing that was not of the essence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
task; by insisting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should thoroughly intermit and break she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had
so provided for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) freedom that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) would, as it were, have only
herself to thank. Strether could not at this point indeed have
completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thought by the image of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) might have to thank
herself FOR: the image, at best, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own likeness-poor Lambert
Strether washed up on the sunny strand by the waves of a single day,
poor Lambert Strether thankful for breathing-time and stiffening
himself while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gasped. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was, and with nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) aspect
or his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) posture to scandalise: it was only true that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had seen Mrs.
Newsome coming he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would instinctively have jumped up to walk away a
little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have come round and back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) bravely, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would
have had first to pull himself together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) abounded in news of the
situation at home, proved to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) how perfectly she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was arranging for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) absence, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) who would take up this and who take up that
exactly where he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had left it, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in fact chapter and verse for
the moral that nothing would suffer. It filled for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), this tone of
hers, all the air; yet it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at the same time as the hum of
vain things. This latter effect was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) tried to justify--and with
the success that, grave though the appearance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at last lighted on a
form that was happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) arrived at it by the inevitable recognition of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) having been a fortnight before one of the weariest of men. If ever
a man had come off tired Lambert Strether was that man; and hadn't it
been distinctly on the ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fatigue that his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wonderful friend
at home had so felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) and so contrived? It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) somehow
at these instants that, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) only maintain with sufficient firmness
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) grasp of that truth, it might become in a manner his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) compass and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) helm. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted most was some idea that would simplify, and
nothing would do this so much as the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was done for and
finished. If it had been in such a light that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had just detected in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) cup the dregs of youth, that was a mere flaw of the surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
scheme. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was so distinctly fagged-out that it must serve precisely
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) convenience, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could but consistently be good for little
enough he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might do everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted.

<p/>Everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted was comprised moreover in a single boon--the
common unattainable art of taking things as they came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) appeared to
himself to have given his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) best years to an active appreciation of the
way they didn't come; but perhaps--as they would seemingly here be
things quite other--this long ache might at last drop to rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
could easily see that from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should accept the notion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) foredoomed collapse the last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would lack would be reasons
and memories. Oh if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) SHOULD do the sum no slate would hold the
figures! The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had failed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) considered, in everything,
in each relation and in half a dozen trades, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) liked luxuriously to
put it, might have made, might still make, for an empty present; but it
stood solidly for a crowded past. It had not been, so much achievement
missed, a light yoke nor a short load. It was at present as if
the backward picture had hung there, the long crooked course, grey in
the shadow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) solitude. It had been a dreadful cheerful sociable
solitude, a solitude of life or choice, of community; but though there
had been people enough all round it there had been but three or four
persons IN it. Waymarsh was one of these, and the fact struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) just
now as marking the record. Mrs. Newsome was another, and Miss Gostrey
had of a sudden shown signs of becoming a third. Beyond, behind them
was the pale figure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) real youth, which held against its breast
the two presences paler than itself--the young wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had early lost
and the young son he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had stupidly sacrificed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had again and again
made out for himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might have kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) little boy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) little
dull boy who had died at school of rapid diphtheria, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had not in
those years so insanely given himself to merely missing the mother. It
was the soreness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) remorse that the child had in all likelihood
not really been dull--had been dull, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been banished and
neglected, mainly because the father had been unwittingly selfish. This
was doubtless but the secret habit of sorrow, which had slowly given
way to time; yet there remained an ache sharp enough to make the
spirit, at the sight now and again of some fair young man just growing
up, wince with the thought of an opportunity lost. Had ever a man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had finally fallen into the way of asking himself, lost so much and
even done so much for so little? There had been particular reasons why
all yesterday, beyond other days, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have had in one ear this
cold enquiry. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name on the green cover, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put it for
Mrs. Newsome, expressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doubtless just enough to make the
world--the world as distinguished, both for more and for less, from
Woollett--ask who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had incurred the ridicule of having to
have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) explanation explained. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Lambert Strether because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
on the cover, whereas it should have been, for anything like glory,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on the cover because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Lambert Strether. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
have done anything for Mrs. Newsome, have been still more
ridiculous--as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might, for that matter, have occasion to be yet;
which came to saying that this acceptance of fate was all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to
show at fifty-five.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judged the quantity as small because it WAS small, and all the more
egregiously since it couldn't, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the case, so much as thinkably
have been larger. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't had the gift of making the most of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
tried, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tried and tried again--no one but himself knew how
often--it appeared to have been that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might demonstrate what else, in
default of that, COULD be made. Old ghosts of experiments came back to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), old drudgeries and delusions, and disgusts, old recoveries with
their relapses, old fevers with their chills, broken moments of good
faith, others of still better doubt; adventures, for the most part, of
the sort qualified as lessons. The special spring that had constantly
played for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the day before was the recognition--frequent enough to
surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--of the promises to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other
visit never kept. The reminiscence to-day most quickened for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
that of the vow taken in the course of the pilgrimage that,
newly-married, with the War just over, and helplessly young in spite of
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had recklessly made with the creature who was so much younger
still. It had been a bold dash, for which they had taken money set
apart for necessities, but kept sacred at the moment in a hundred ways,
and in none more so than by this private pledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own to treat the
occasion as a relation formed with the higher culture and see that, as
they said at Woollett, it should bear a good harvest. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had believed,
sailing home again, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gained something great, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
theory--with an elaborate innocent plan of reading, digesting, coming
back even, every few years--had then been to preserve, cherish and
extend it. As such plans as these had come to nothing, however, in
respect to acquisitions still more precious, it was doubtless little
enough of a marvel that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have lost account of that handful of
seed. Buried for long years in dark corners at any rate these few
germs had sprouted again under forty-eight hours of Paris. The process
of yesterday had really been the process of feeling the general stirred
life of connexions long since individually dropped. Strether had
become acquainted even on this ground with short gusts of
speculation--sudden flights of fancy in Louvre galleries, hungry gazes
through clear plates behind which lemon-coloured volumes were as fresh
as fruit on the tree.

<p/>There were instants at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could ask whether, since there had been
fundamentally so little question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) keeping anything, the fate
after all decreed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't been only to BE kept. Kept for
something, in that event, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't pretend, didn't possibly dare
as yet to divine; something that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hover and wonder and laugh
and sigh, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) advance and retreat, feeling half ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
impulse to plunge and more than half afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) impulse to wait. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
remembered for instance how he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had gone back in the sixties with
lemon-coloured volumes in general on the brain as well as with a
dozen--selected for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wife too--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) trunk; and nothing had at the
moment shown more confidence than this invocation of the finer taste.
They were still somewhere at home, the dozen--stale and soiled and
never sent to the binder; but what had become of the sharp initiation
they represented? They represented now the mere sallow paint on the
door of the temple of taste that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had dreamed of raising up--a
structure he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had practically never carried further. Strether's present
highest flights were perhaps those in which this particular lapse
figured to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as a symbol, a symbol of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) long grind and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) want of
odd moments, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) want moreover of money, of opportunity, of positive
dignity. That the memory of the vow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) youth should, in order to
throb again, have had to wait for this last, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt it, of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
accidents--that was surely proof enough of how his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) conscience had been
encumbered. If any further proof were needed it would have been to be
found in the fact that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) perfectly now saw, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had ceased even to
measure his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) meagreness, a meagreness that sprawled, in this retrospect,
vague and comprehensive, stretching back like some unmapped Hinterland
from a rough coast-settlement. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) conscience had been amusing itself
for the forty-eight hours by forbidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the purchase of a book; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
held off from that, held off from everything; from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't
yet call on Chad he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wouldn't for the world have taken any other step.
On this evidence, however, of the way they actually affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
glared at the lemon-coloured covers in confession of the
subconsciousness that, all the same, in the great desert of the years,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) must have had of them. The green covers at home comprised, by the
law of their purpose, no tribute to letters; it was of a mere rich
kernel of economics, politics, ethics that, glazed and, as Mrs. Newsome
maintained rather against HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) view, pre-eminently pleasant to touch,
they formed the specious shell. Without therefore any needed
instinctive knowledge of what was coming out, in Paris, on the bright
highway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) struck himself at present as having more than once flushed
with a suspicion: he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) couldn't otherwise at present be feeling so many
fears confirmed. There were <div class="bookquote">``movements''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was too late for: weren't
they, with the fun of them, already spent? There were sequences he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
missed and great gaps in the procession: he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might have been watching
it all recede in a golden cloud of dust. If the playhouse wasn't
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) seat had at least fallen to somebody else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had had an
uneasy feeling the night before that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was at the theatre at
all--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) indeed justified the theatre, in the specific sense, and
with a grotesqueness to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) imagination did all honour, as
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) owed poor Waymarsh--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should have been there with, and as
might have been said, FOR Chad.

<p/>This suggested the question of whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could properly have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
to such a play, and what effect--it was a point that suddenly rose--his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
peculiar responsibility might be held in general to have on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) choice
of entertainment. It had literally been present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) at the
Gymnase--where one was held moreover comparatively safe--that having
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) young friend at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) side would have been an odd feature of the work
of redemption; and this quite in spite of the fact that the picture
presented might well, confronted with Chad's own private stage, have
seemed the pattern of propriety. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) clearly hadn't come out in the
name of propriety but to visit unattended equivocal performances; yet
still less had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) done so to undermine his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) authority by sharing them
with the graceless youth. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to renounce all amusement for the
sweet sake of that authority? and WOULD such renouncement give him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) for
Chad a moral glamour? The little problem bristled the more by reason
of poor Strether's fairly open sense of the irony of things. Were
there then sides on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) predicament threatened to look rather
droll to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)? Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) have to pretend to believe--either to himself
or the wretched boy--that there was anything that could make the latter
worse? Wasn't some such pretence on the other hand involved in the
assumption of possible processes that would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) better? His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
greatest uneasiness seemed to peep at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) out of the imminent
impression that almost any acceptance of Paris might give one's
authority away. It hung before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) this morning, the vast bright
Babylon, like some huge iridescent object, a jewel brilliant and hard,
in which parts were not to be discriminated nor differences comfortably
marked. It twinkled and trembled and melted together, and what seemed
all surface one moment seemed all depth the next. It was a place of
which, unmistakeably, Chad was fond; wherefore if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), Strether, should
like it too much, what on earth, with such a bond, would become of
either of them? It all depended of course--which was a gleam of
light--on how the <div class="bookquote">``too much''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>was measured; though indeed our friend
fairly felt, while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) prolonged the meditation I describe, that for
himself even already a certain measure had been reached. It will have
been sufficiently seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not a man to neglect any good chance
for reflexion. Was it at all possible for instance to like Paris
enough without liking it too much? He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) luckily however hadn't promised
Mrs. Newsome not to like it at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was ready to recognise at this
stage that such an engagement WOULD have tied his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands. The
Luxembourg Gardens were incontestably just so adorable at this hour by
reason--in addition to their intrinsic charm--of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) not having taken
it. The only engagement he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had taken, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked the thing in the
face, was to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reasonably could.

<p/>It upset him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a little none the less and after a while to find himself
at last remembering on what current of association he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been floated
so far. Old imaginations of the Latin Quarter had played their part
for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had duly recalled its having been with this scene of
rather ominous legend that, like so many young men in fiction as well
as in fact, Chad had begun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was now quite out of it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``home,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as Strether figured the place, in the Boulevard Malesherbes;
which was perhaps why, repairing, not to fail of justice either, to the
elder neighbourhood, our friend had felt he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could allow for the element
of the usual, the immemorial, without courting perturbation. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
not at least in danger of seeing the youth and the particular Person
flaunt by together; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was in the very air of which--just to
feel what the early natural note must have been--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wished most to take
counsel. It became at once vivid to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had originally had,
for a few days, an almost envious vision of the boy's romantic
privilege. Melancholy Murger, with Francine and Musette and Rodolphe,
at home, in the company of the tattered, one--if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) single
self two or three--of the unbound, the paper-covered dozen on the
shelf; and when Chad had written, five years ago, after a sojourn then
already prolonged to six months, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had decided to go in for
economy and the real thing, Strether's fancy had quite fondly
accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in this migration, which was to convey him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), as they
somewhat confusedly learned at Woollett, across the bridges and up the
Montagne Sainte-Genevieve. This was the region--Chad had been quite
distinct about it--in which the best French, and many other things,
were to be learned at least cost, and in which all sorts of clever
fellows, compatriots there for a purpose, formed an awfully pleasant
set. The clever fellows, the friendly countrymen were mainly young
painters, sculptors, architects, medical students; but they were, Chad
sagely opined, a much more profitable lot to be with--even on the
footing of not being quite one of them--than the <div class="bookquote">``terrible toughs''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Strether remembered the edifying discrimination-RRB- of the American bars
and banks roundabout the Opera. Chad had thrown out, in the
communications following this one--for at that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) did once in a
while communicate--that several members of a band of earnest workers
under one of the great artists had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) right in, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) dine
every night, almost for nothing, at their place, and even pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
not to neglect the hypothesis of there being as much <div class="bookquote">``in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as in any
of them. There had been literally a moment at which it appeared there
might be something in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); there had been at any rate a moment at which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had written that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't know but what a month or two more might
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) enrolled in some atelier. The season had been one at which
Mrs. Newsome was moved to gratitude for small mercies; it had broken on
them all as a blessing that their absentee HAD perhaps a
conscience--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was sated in fine with idleness, was ambitious of
variety. The exhibition was doubtless as yet not brilliant, but
Strether himself, even by that time much enlisted and immersed, had
determined, on the part of the two ladies, a temperate approval and in
fact, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now recollected, a certain austere enthusiasm.

<p/>But the very next thing that happened had been a dark drop of the
curtain. The son and brother had not browsed long on the Montagne
Sainte-Genevieve--his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) effective little use of the name of which, like
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) allusion to the best French, appeared to have been but one of the
notes of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rough cunning. The light refreshment of these vain
appearances had not accordingly carried any of them very far. On the
other hand it had gained Chad time; it had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a chance,
unchecked, to strike his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) roots, had paved the way for initiations more
direct and more deep. It was Strether's belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been
comparatively innocent before this first migration, and even that the
first effects of the migration would not have been, without some
particular bad accident, to have been deplored. There had been three
months--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had sufficiently figured it out--in which Chad had wanted to
try. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) HAD tried, though not very hard--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) little hour of
good faith. The weakness of this principle in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was that almost any
accident attestedly bad enough was stronger. Such had at any rate
markedly been the case for the precipitation of a special series of
impressions. They had proved, successively, these impressions--all of
Musette and Francine, but Musette and Francine vulgarised by the larger
evolution of the type--irresistibly sharp: he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``taken up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by what
was at the time to be shrinkingly gathered, as it was scantly
mentioned, with one ferociously <div class="bookquote">``interested''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>little person after
another. Strether had read somewhere of a Latin motto, a description
of the hours, observed on a clock by a traveller in Spain; and he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) had
been led to apply it in thought to Chad's number one, number two,
number three. Omnes vulnerant, ultima necat--they had all morally
wounded, the last had morally killed. The last had been longest in
possession--in possession, that is, of whatever was left of the poor
boy's finer mortality. And it hadn't been she (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), it had been one of her (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
early predecessors, who had determined the second migration, the
expensive return and relapse, the exchange again, as was fairly to be
presumed, of the vaunted best French for some special variety of the
worst.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pulled himself then at last together for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own progress back; not
with the feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walk in vain. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prolonged it a
little, in the immediate neighbourhood, after he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chair;
and the upshot of the whole morning for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) campaign had
begun. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had wanted to put himself in relation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would be
hanged if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were NOT in relation. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was that at no moment so much as
while, under the old arches of the Odeon, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lingered before the
charming open-air array of literature classic and casual. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) found the
effect of tone and tint, in the long charged tables and shelves,
delicate and appetising; the impression--substituting one kind of
low-priced consommation for another--might have been that of one of the
pleasant cafes that overlapped, under an awning, to the pavement; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) edged along, grazing the tables, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands firmly behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wasn't there to dip, to consume--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was there to reconstruct. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
wasn't there for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own profit--not, that is, the direct; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was there
on some chance of feeling the brush of the wing of the stray spirit of
youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt it in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had it beside him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); the old arcade
indeed, as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) inner sense listened, gave out the faint sound, as from
far off, of the wild waving of wings. They were folded now over the
breasts of buried generations; but a flutter or two lived again in the
turned page of shock-headed slouch-hatted loiterers whose young
intensity of type, in the direction of pale acuteness, deepened his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
vision, and even his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) appreciation, of racial differences, and whose
manipulation of the uncut volume was too often, however, but a
listening at closed doors. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reconstructed a possible groping Chad of
three or four years before, a Chad who had, after all, simply--for that
was the only way to see it--been too vulgar for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) privilege. Surely
it WAS a privilege to have been young and happy just there. Well, the
best thing Strether knew of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had had such a dream.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own actual business half an hour later was with a third floor
on the Boulevard Malesherbes--so much as that was definite; and the
fact of the enjoyment by the third-floor windows of a continuous
balcony, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was helped by this knowledge, had perhaps
something to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lingering for five minutes on the opposite
side of the street. There were points as to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had quite made up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mind, and one of these bore precisely on the wisdom of the
abruptness to which events had finally committed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), a policy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
was pleased to find not at all shaken as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) watch and
wondered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) HAD announced himself--six months before; had written out
at least that Chad wasn't to be surprised should he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) some day
turn up. Chad had thereupon, in a few words of rather carefully
colourless answer, offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a general welcome; and Strether,
ruefully reflecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might have understood the warning as a hint
to hospitality, a bid for an invitation, had fallen back upon silence
as the corrective most to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own taste. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had asked Mrs. Newsome
moreover not to announce him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had so distinct an opinion on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) attacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) job, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) attack it at all, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own way. Not
the least of this lady's high merits for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could
absolutely rest on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) word. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the only woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had known, even
at Woollett, as to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) conviction was positive that to lie was
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) art. Sarah Pocock, for instance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) own daughter, though
with social ideals, as they said, in some respects different--Sarah who
WAS, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) way, aesthetic, had never refused to human commerce that
mitigation of rigour; there were occasions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had distinctly seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) apply it. Since, accordingly, at all events, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had had it from
Mrs. Newsome that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had, at whatever cost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) more strenuous view,
conformed, in the matter of preparing Chad, wholly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) restrictions,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) now looked up at the fine continuous balcony with a safe sense that
if the case had been bungled the mistake was at least his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) property. Was
there perhaps just a suspicion of that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) present pause on the edge
of the Boulevard and well in the pleasant light?

<p/>Many things came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) here, and one of them was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should
doubtless presently know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been shallow or sharp. Another
was that the balcony in question didn't somehow show as a convenience
easy to surrender. Poor Strether had at this very moment to recognise
the truth that wherever one paused in Paris the imagination reacted
before one could stop it. This perpetual reaction put a price, if one
would, on pauses; but it piled up consequences till there was scarce
room to pick one's steps among them. What call had he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), at such a
juncture, for example, to like Chad's very house? High broad clear--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
was expert enough to make out in a moment that it was admirably
built--it fairly embarrassed our friend by the quality that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
would have said, it <div class="bookquote">``sprang''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had struck off the fancy that
it might, as a preliminary, be of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to be seen, by a happy
accident, from the third-story windows, which took all the March sun,
but of what service was it to find himself making out after a moment
that the quality <div class="bookquote">``sprung,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>the quality produced by measure and balance,
the fine relation of part to part and space to space, was
probably--aided by the presence of ornament as positive as it was
discreet, and by the complexion of the stone, a cold fair grey, warmed
and polished a little by life--neither more nor less than a case of
distinction, such a case as he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) could only feel unexpectedly as a sort
of delivered challenge? Meanwhile, however, the chance he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) had allowed
for--the chance of being seen in time from the balcony--had become a
fact. Two or three of the windows stood open to the violet air; and,
before Strether had cut the knot by crossing, a young man had come out
and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), had lighted a cigarette and tossed the match
over, and then, resting on the rail, had given himself up to watching
the life below while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smoked. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrival contributed, in its order,
to keeping Strether in position; the result of which in turn was that
Strether soon felt himself noticed. The young man began to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
as in acknowledgement of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being himself in observation.

<p/>This was interesting so far as it went, but the interest was affected
by the young man's not being Chad. Strether wondered at first if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
were perhaps Chad altered, and then saw that this was asking too much
of alteration. The young man was light bright and alert--with an air
too pleasant to have been arrived at by patching. Strether had
conceived Chad as patched, but not beyond recognition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was in
presence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt, of amendments enough as they stood; it was a
sufficient amendment that the gentleman up there should be Chad's
friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was young too then, the gentleman up there--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was very
young; young enough apparently to be amused at an elderly watcher, to
be curious even to see what the elderly watcher would do on finding
himself watched. There was youth in that, there was youth in the
surrender to the balcony, there was youth for Strether at this moment
in everything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own business; and Chad's thus pronounced
association with youth had given the next instant an extraordinary
quick lift to the issue. The balcony, the distinguished front,
testified suddenly, for Strether's fancy, to something that was up and
up; they placed the whole case materially, and as by an admirable
image, on a level that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found himself at the end of another moment
rejoicing to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might reach. The young man looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at the young man; and the issue, by a rapid process, was that
this knowledge of a perched privacy appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the last of
luxuries. To him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too the perched privacy was open, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw it now
but in one light--that of the only domicile, the only fireside, in the
great ironic city, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the shadow of a claim. Miss Gostrey
had a fireside; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of it, and it was something that
doubtless awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but Miss Gostrey hadn't yet arrived--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
mightn't arrive for days; and the sole attenuation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excluded
state was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vision of the small, the admittedly secondary hotel in
the bye-street from the Rue de la Paix, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) solicitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
purse had placed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), which affected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somehow as all indoor chill,
glass-roofed court and slippery staircase, and which, by the same
token, expressed the presence of Waymarsh even at times when Waymarsh
might have been certain to be round at the bank. It came to pass
before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved that Waymarsh, and Waymarsh alone, Waymarsh not only
undiluted but positively strengthened, struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as the present
alternative to the young man in the balcony. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did move it was
fairly to escape that alternative. Taking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way over the street at
last and passing through the porte-cochere of the house was like
consciously leaving Waymarsh out. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all about
it.





<p/>Book Third




<p/>I


<p/>Strether told Waymarsh all about it that very evening, on their dining
together at the hotel; which needn't have happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was all the
while aware, hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) chosen to sacrifice to this occasion a rarer
opportunity. The mention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion of the sacrifice was
moreover exactly what introduced his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) recital--or, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have
called it with more confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interlocutor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) confession. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
confession was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been captured and that one of the features
of the affair had just failed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) engaging himself on the spot to
dinner. As by such a freedom Waymarsh would have lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
obeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) scruple; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had likewise obeyed another scruple--which
bore on the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself bringing a guest.

<p/>Waymarsh looked gravely ardent, over the finished soup, at this array
of scruples; Strether hadn't yet got quite used to being so unprepared
for the consequences of the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) produced. It was
comparatively easy to explain, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't felt sure his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
guest would please. The person was a young man whose acquaintance he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had made but that afternoon in the course of rather a hindered enquiry
for another person--an enquiry his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new friend had just prevented in
fact from being vain. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``I've all sorts of things
to tell you!'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put it in a way that was a virtual hint to
Waymarsh to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to enjoy the telling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fish, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
drank of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) long moustache, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took in the two English ladies who had just creaked past them
and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would even have articulately greeted if they hadn't rather
chilled the impulse; so that all he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could do was--by way of doing
something--to say <div class="bookquote">``Merci, Francois!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>out quite loud when his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fish was
brought. Everything was there that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted, everything that could
make the moment an occasion, that would do beautifully--everything but
what Waymarsh might give. The little waxed salle-a-manger was sallow
and sociable; Francois, dancing over it, all smiles, was a man and a
brother; the high-shouldered patronne, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) high-held, much-rubbed
hands, seemed always assenting exuberantly to something unsaid; the
Paris evening in short was, for Strether, in the very taste of the
soup, in the goodness, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was innocently pleased to think it, of the
wine, in the pleasant coarse texture of the napkin and the crunch of
the thick-crusted bread. These all were things congruous with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
confession, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) confession was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) HAD--it would come out
properly just there if Waymarsh would only take it properly--agreed to
breakfast out, at twelve literally, the next day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't quite know
where; the delicacy of the case came straight up in the remembrance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) new friend's <div class="bookquote">``We'll see; I'll take you somewhere!'' (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>--for it had
required little more than that, after all, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) right in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was
affected after a minute, face to face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) actual comrade, by the
impulse to overcolour. There had already been things in respect to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew himself tempted by this perversity. If Waymarsh thought
them bad he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should at least have his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) discomfort; so
Strether showed them as worse. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was now, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) way,
sincerely perplexed.

<p/>Chad had been absent from the Boulevard Malesherbes--was absent from
Paris altogether; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had learned that from the concierge, but had
nevertheless gone up, and gone up--there were no two ways about
it--from an uncontrollable, a really, if one would, depraved curiosity.
The concierge had mentioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) that a friend of the tenant of the
troisieme was for the time in possession; and this had been Strether's
pretext for a further enquiry, an experiment carried on, under Chad's
roof, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) knowledge. <div class="bookquote">``I found his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) friend in fact there keeping
the place warm, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) called it, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>); Chad himself being, as
appears, in the south. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) went a month ago to Cannes and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
return begins to be looked for it can't be for some days. I might, you
see, perfectly have waited a week; might have beaten a retreat as soon
as I got this essential knowledge. But I beat no retreat; I did the
opposite; I stayed, I dawdled, I trifled; above all I looked round. I
saw, in fine; and--I don't know what to call it--I sniffed. It's a
detail, but it's as if there were something--something very good--TO
sniff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh's face had shown his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) friend an attention apparently so remote
that the latter was slightly surprised to find it at this point abreast
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean a smell? What of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A charming scent. But I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh gave an inferential grunt. <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) live there with a woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh waited an instant for more, then resumed. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) taken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
off with him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back?'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether fell into the enquiry. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
wound it up as before. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The way he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wound it up, accompanied as this was with another drop back,
another degustation of the Leoville, another wipe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) moustache and
another good word for Francois, seemed to produce in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion a
slight irritation. <div class="bookquote">``Then what the devil DO you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether almost gaily, <div class="bookquote">``I guess I don't know anything!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gaiety might have been a tribute to the fact that the state he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
been reduced to did for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) again what had been done by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) talk of the
matter with Miss Gostrey at the London theatre. It was somehow
enlarging; and the air of that amplitude was now doubtless more or
less--and all for Waymarsh to feel--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) further response. <div class="bookquote">``That's
what I found out from the young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought you said you found out nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but that--that I don't know anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what good does that do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``what I've come to you to help me to
discover. I mean anything about anything over here. I FELT that, up
there. It regularly rose before me in its might. The young man
moreover--Chad's friend--as good as told me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As good as told you you know nothing about anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh
appeared to look at some one who might have as good as told HIM. <div class="bookquote">``How
old is he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess not thirty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you had to take that from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I took a good deal more--since, as I tell you, I took an invitation
to dejeuner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you GOING to that unholy meal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll come with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wants you too, you know. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) about
you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) card,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether pursued, <div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) name's rather
funny. It's John Little Bilham, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) two surnames are, on
account of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) being small, inevitably used together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh asked with due detachment from these details, <div class="bookquote">``what's
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) doing up there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) account of himself is that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s `only a little artist-man.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>That
seemed to me perfectly to describe him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)'s yet in the phase of
study; this, you know, is the great art-school--to pass a certain
number of years in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came over. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)'s a great friend of
Chad's, and occupying Chad's rooms just now because they're so
pleasant. HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)<div class="bookquote">``S very pleasant and curious too,''  (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div>Strether added--<div class="bookquote">``though
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s not from Boston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh looked already rather sick of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether thought. ``I don't know that, either. But he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s ``notoriously,<div class="bookquote">''
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put it himself, not from Boston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh moralised from dry depths, <div class="bookquote">``every one can't
notoriously be from Boston. Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``is he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) curious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps just for THAT--for one thing! But really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether added,
<div class="bookquote">``for everything. When you meet him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) you'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I don't want to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh impatiently growled. <div class="bookquote">``Why
don't he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) go home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Well, because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) likes it over here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>This appeared in particular more than Waymarsh could bear. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ought
then to be ashamed of himself, and, as you admit that you think so too,
why drag him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's reply again took time. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I do think so
myself--though I don't quite yet admit it. I'm not a bit sure--it's
again one of the things I want to find out. I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and CAN you
like people--? But no matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pulled himself up. <div class="bookquote">``There's no
doubt I want you to come down on me and squash me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh helped himself to the next course, which, however proving not
the dish he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had just noted as supplied to the English ladies, had the
effect of causing his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) imagination temporarily to wander. But it
presently broke out at a softer spot. <div class="bookquote">``Have they got a handsome place
up there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh a charming place; full of beautiful and valuable things. I never
saw such a place'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--and Strether's thought went back to it. <div class="bookquote">``For a
little artist-man--!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could in fact scarce express it.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion, who appeared now to have a view, insisted. <div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, life can hold nothing better. Besides, they're things of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s in charge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does doorkeeper for your precious pair? Can life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh
enquired, <div class="bookquote">``hold nothing better than THAT?''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Then as Strether, silent,
seemed even yet to wonder, <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) know what SHE is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I didn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). I couldn't. It was impossible. You
wouldn't either. Besides I didn't want to. No more would you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether in short explained it at a stroke. <div class="bookquote">``You can't make out over
here what people do know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what did you come over for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose exactly to see for myself--without their aid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what do you want mine for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed, <div class="bookquote">``you're not one of THEM! I do know what you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>As, however, this last assertion caused Waymarsh again to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
hard--such being the latter's doubt of its implications--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
justification lame. Which was still more the case when Waymarsh
presently said: <div class="bookquote">``Look here, Strether. Quit this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Our friend smiled with a doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean my tone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--damn your tone. I mean your nosing round. Quit the whole job.
Let them stew in their juice. You're being used for a thing you ain't
fit for. People don't take a fine-tooth comb to groom a horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I a fine-tooth comb?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed. <div class="bookquote">``It's something I never
called myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's what you are, all the same. You ain't so young as you were, but
you've kept your teeth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) acknowledged his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend's humour. <div class="bookquote">``Take care I don't get them into
YOU! You'd like them, my friends at home, Waymarsh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) declared;
<div class="bookquote">``you'd really particularly like them. And I know'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--it was slightly
irrelevant, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gave it sudden and singular force--<div class="bookquote">``I know they'd
like you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh don't work them off on ME!''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh groaned.

<p/>Yet Strether still lingered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pockets. <div class="bookquote">``It's
really quite as indispensable as I say that Chad should be got back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indispensable to whom? To you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether presently said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because if you get him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) you also get Mrs. Newsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether faced it. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you don't get him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) you don't get her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It might be merciless, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued not to flinch. <div class="bookquote">``I think it
might have some effect on our personal understanding. Chad's of real
importance--or can easily become so if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) will--to the business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the business is of real importance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother's husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I naturally want what my future wife wants. And the thing will
be much better if we have our own man in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have your own man in it, in other words,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh said,
<div class="bookquote">``you'll marry--you personally--more money. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s already rich, as I
understand you, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll be richer still if the business can be made
to boom on certain lines that you've laid down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't laid them down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether promptly returned. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Newsome--who knew extraordinarily well what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was about--laid them
down ten years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh well, Waymarsh seemed to indicate with a shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mane, THAT
didn't matter! <div class="bookquote">``You're fierce for the boom anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend weighed a moment in silence the justice of the charge. <div class="bookquote">``I
can scarcely be called fierce, I think, when I so freely take my chance
of the possibility, the danger, of being influenced in a sense counter
to Mrs. Newsome's own feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh gave this proposition a long hard look. <div class="bookquote">``I see. You're
afraid yourself of being squared. But you're a humbug,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``all
the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether quickly protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you ask me for protection--which makes you very interesting; and
then you won't take it. You say you want to be squashed--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but not so easily! Don't you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether demanded <div class="bookquote">``where my
interest, as already shown you, lies? It lies in my not being squared.
If I'm squared where's my marriage? If I miss my errand I miss that;
and if I miss that I miss everything--I'm nowhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh--but all relentlessly--took this in. <div class="bookquote">``What do I care where
you are if you're spoiled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes met on it an instant. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you awfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether at last
said. <div class="bookquote">``But don't you think HER judgement of that--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought to content me? No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It kept them again face to face, and the end of this was that Strether
again laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You do her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) injustice. You really MUST know her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).
Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) breakfasted with Mr. Bilham on the morrow, and, as inconsequently
befell, with Waymarsh massively of the party. The latter announced, at
the eleventh hour and much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend's surprise, that, damn it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
would as soon join him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as do anything else; on which they proceeded
together, strolling in a state of detachment practically luxurious for
them to the Boulevard Malesherbes, a couple engaged that day with the
sharp spell of Paris as confessedly, it might have been seen, as any
couple among the daily thousands so compromised. They walked,
wandered, wondered and, a little, lost themselves; Strether hadn't had
for years so rich a consciousness of time--a bag of gold into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
constantly dipped for a handful. It was present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that when the
little business with Mr. Bilham should be over he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) would still have
shining hours to use absolutely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) liked. There was no great pulse
of haste yet in this process of saving Chad; nor was that effect a bit
more marked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sat, half an hour later, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) legs under Chad's
mahogany, with Mr. Bilham on one side, with a friend of Mr. Bilham's on
the other, with Waymarsh stupendously opposite, and with the great hum
of Paris coming up in softness, vagueness-for Strether himself indeed
already positive sweetness--through the sunny windows toward which, the
day before, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) curiosity had raised its wings from below. The feeling
strongest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at that moment had borne fruit almost faster than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
could taste it, and Strether literally felt at the present hour that
there was a precipitation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had known nothing and nobody
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stood in the street; but hadn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) view now taken a bound in the
direction of every one and of every thing?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) up to, what's he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) up to?'' (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>--something like that was at the
back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head all the while in respect to little Bilham; but
meanwhile, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) should make out, every one and every thing were as
good as represented for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) by the combination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) host and the lady
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) left. The lady on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) left, the lady thus promptly and
ingeniously invited to <div class="bookquote">``meet''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Mr. Strether and Mr. Waymarsh--it was the
way she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) herself expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) case--was a very marked person, a person
who had much to do with our friend's asking himself if the occasion
weren't in its essence the most baited, the most gilded of traps.
Baited it could properly be called when the repast was of so wise a
savour, and gilded surrounding objects seemed inevitably to need to be
when Miss Barrace--which was the lady's name--looked at them with
convex Parisian eyes and through a glass with a remarkably long
tortoise-shell handle. Why Miss Barrace, mature meagre erect and
eminently gay, highly adorned, perfectly familiar, freely
contradictions and reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of some last-century portrait of a
clever head without powder--why Miss Barrace should have been in
particular the note of a <div class="bookquote">``trap''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Strether couldn't on the spot have
explained; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) blinked in the light of a conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should know
later on, and know well--as it came over him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), for that matter, with
force, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should need to. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was to think
exactly of either of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) new friends; since the young man, Chad's
intimate and deputy, had, in thus constituting the scene, practised so
much more subtly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been prepared for, and since in especial
Miss Barrace, surrounded clearly by every consideration, hadn't
scrupled to figure as a familiar object. It was interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to
feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was in the presence of new measures, other standards, a
different scale of relations, and that evidently here were a happy pair
who didn't think of things at all as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) and Waymarsh thought. Nothing
was less to have been calculated in the business than that it should
now be for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) and Waymarsh were comparatively quite at one.

<p/>The latter was magnificent--this at least was an assurance privately
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) by Miss Barrace. <div class="bookquote">``Oh your friend's a type, the grand old
American--what shall one call it? The Hebrew prophet, Ezekiel,
Jeremiah, who used when I was a little girl in the Rue Montaigne to
come to see my father and who was usually the American Minister to the
Tuileries or some other court. I haven't seen one these ever so many
years; the sight of it warms my poor old chilled heart; this specimen
is wonderful; in the right quarter, you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)'ll have a succes fou.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether hadn't failed to ask what the right quarter might be, much as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) required his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) presence of mind to meet such a change in their scheme.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh the artist-quarter and that kind of thing; HERE already, for
instance, as you see.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been on the point of echoing
<div class="bookquote">''`Here'?--is THIS the artist-quarter?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had already disposed of
the question with a wave of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) tortoise-shell and an easy <div class="bookquote">``Bring
him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) to ME!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew on the spot how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should be able to bring
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), for the very air was by this time, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sense, thick and hot
with poor Waymarsh's judgement of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was in the trap still more
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion and, unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion, not making the best of
it; which was precisely what doubtless gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) admirable sombre
glow. Little did Miss Barrace know that what was behind it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
grave estimate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) own laxity. The general assumption with which our
two friends had arrived had been that of finding Mr. Bilham ready to
conduct them to one or other of those resorts of the earnest, the
aesthetic fraternity which were shown among the sights of Paris. In
this character it would have justified them in a proper insistence on
discharging their score. Waymarsh's only proviso at the last had been
that nobody should pay for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) found himself, as the occasion
developed, paid for on a scale as to which Strether privately made out
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) already nursed retribution. Strether was conscious across the
table of what worked in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), conscious when they passed back to the
small salon to which, the previous evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself had made so rich
a reference; conscious most of all as they stepped out to the balcony
in which one would have had to be an ogre not to recognise the perfect
place for easy aftertastes. These things were enhanced for Miss
Barrace by a succession of excellent cigarettes--acknowledged,
acclaimed, as a part of the wonderful supply left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>ogre</b></font>) by
Chad--in an almost equal absorption of which Strether found himself
blindly, almost wildly pushing forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might perish by the sword
as well as by famine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) having abetted the lady by
an excess that was rare with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would count for little in the sum--as
Waymarsh might so easily add it up--of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) licence. Waymarsh had
smoked of old, smoked hugely; but Waymarsh did nothing now, and that
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) advantage over people who took things up lightly just when
others had laid them heavily down. Strether had never smoked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) flaunted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend that this had been only because of
a reason. The reason, it now began to appear even to himself, was that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never had a lady to smoke with.

<p/>It was this lady's being there at all, however, that was the strange
free thing; perhaps, since she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) WAS there, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smoking was the least of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) freedoms. If Strether had been sure at each juncture of what--with
Bilham in especial--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talked about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) might have traced others and
winced at them and felt Waymarsh wince; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was in fact so often at
sea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) sense of the range of reference was merely general and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) on several different occasions guessed and interpreted only to
doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) wondered what they meant, but there were things he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) scarce
thought they could be supposed to mean, and <div class="bookquote">``Oh no--not THAT!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was at
the end of most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) ventures. This was the very beginning with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
of a condition as to which, later on, it will be seen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) found cause
to pull himself up; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was to remember the moment duly as the first
step in a process. The central fact of the place was neither more nor
less, when analysed--and a pressure superficial sufficed--than the
fundamental impropriety of Chad's situation, round about which they
thus seemed cynically clustered. Accordingly, since they took it for
granted, they took for granted all that was in connexion with it taken
for granted at Woollett--matters as to which, verily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been
reduced with Mrs. Newsome to the last intensity of silence. That was
the consequence of their being too bad to be talked about, and was the
accompaniment, by the same token, of a deep conception of their
badness. It befell therefore that when poor Strether put it to himself
that their badness was ultimately, or perhaps even insolently, what
such a scene as the one before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was, so to speak, built upon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
could scarce shirk the dilemma of reading a roundabout echo of them
into almost anything that came up. This, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was well aware, was a
dreadful necessity; but such was the stern logic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could only gather,
of a relation to the irregular life.

<p/>It was the way the irregular life sat upon Bilham and Miss Barrace that
was the insidious, the delicate marvel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was eager to concede that
their relation to it was all indirect, for anything else in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) would
have shown the grossness of bad manners; but the indirectness was none
the less consonant--THAT was striking-with a grateful enjoyment of
everything that was Chad's. They spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) repeatedly, invoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
good name and good nature, and the worst confusion of mind for Strether
was that all their mention of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was of a kind to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) honour. They
commended his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) munificence and approved his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) taste, and in doing so sat
down, as it seemed to Strether, in the very soil out of which these
things flowered. Our friend's final predicament was that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) himself
was sitting down, for the time, WITH them, and there was a supreme
moment at which, compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) collapse, Waymarsh's erectness
affected him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as really high. One thing was certain--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must
make up his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must approach Chad, must wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), deal with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), master him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mustn't dispossess himself of the faculty of
seeing things as they were. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) must bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to HIM--not go himself,
as it were, so much of the way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) must at any rate be clearer as to
what--should he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) continue to do that for convenience--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was still
condoning. It was on the detail of this quantity--and what could the
fact be but mystifying?-that Bilham and Miss Barrace threw so little
light. So there they were.



<p/>II


<p/>When Miss Gostrey arrived, at the end of a week, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) a sign;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) went immediately to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), and it wasn't till then that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) could
again close his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) grasp on the idea of a corrective. This idea however
was luckily all before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) again from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) crossed the
threshold of the little entresol of the Quartier Marboeuf into which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had gathered, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said, picking them up in a thousand flights
and funny little passionate pounces, the makings of a final nest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
recognised in an instant that there really, there only, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) should find
the boon with the vision of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had first mounted Chad's stairs.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) might have been a little scared at the picture of how much more, in
this place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) should know himself <div class="bookquote">``in''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>hadn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) friend been on the
spot to measure the amount to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) appetite. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) compact and crowded
little chambers, almost dusky, as they at first struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>), with
accumulations, represented a supreme general adjustment to
opportunities and conditions. Wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) looked he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) saw an old ivory
or an old brocade, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) scarce knew where to sit for fear of a
misappliance. The life of the occupant struck him (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>) of a sudden as more
charged with possession even than Chad's or than Miss Barrace's; wide
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) glimpse had lately become of the empire of <div class="bookquote">``things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>what was
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) still enlarged it; the lust of the eyes and the pride of
life had indeed thus their temple. It was the innermost nook of the
shrine--as brown as a pirate's cave. In the brownness were glints of
gold; patches of purple were in the gloom; objects all that caught,
through the muslin, with their high rarity, the light of the low
windows. Nothing was clear about them but that they were precious, and
they brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) ignorance with their contempt as a flower, in a
liberty taken with him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>), might have been whisked under his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) nose. But
after a full look at his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) hostess he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) knew none the less what most
concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>). The circle in which they stood together was warm with
life, and every question between them would live there as nowhere else.
A question came up as soon as they had spoken, for his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) answer, with a
laugh, was quickly: <div class="bookquote">``Well, they've got hold of me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Much of their
talk on this first occasion was his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) development of that truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) was
extraordinarily glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), expressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) frankly what she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
most showed him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>), that one might live for years without a blessing
unsuspected, but that to know it at last for no more than three days
was to need it or miss it for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was the blessing that had now
become his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) need, and what could prove it better than that without her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) had lost himself?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) asked with an absence of alarm that, correcting
him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) had mistaken the <div class="bookquote">``period''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) pieces, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>)
afresh a sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) easy movement through the maze he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) had but begun
to tread. <div class="bookquote">``What in the name of all the Pococks have you managed to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why exactly the wrong thing. I've made a frantic friend of little
Bilham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah that sort of thing was of the essence of your case and to have been
allowed for from the first.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And it was only after this that, quite as
a minor matter, she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) asked who in the world little Bilham might be. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was a friend of Chad's and living for the time in
Chad's rooms in Chad's absence, quite as if acting in Chad's spirit and
serving Chad's cause, she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) showed, however, more interest. <div class="bookquote">``Should you
mind my seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)? Only once, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh the oftener the better: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'s amusing--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'s original.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) doesn't shock you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey threw out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never in the world! We escape that with a perfection--! I feel it to
be largely, no doubt, because I don't half-understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>); but our
modus vivendi isn't spoiled even by that. You must dine with me to
meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on. <div class="bookquote">``Then you'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you giving dinners?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--there I am. That's what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kindness wondered. <div class="bookquote">``That you're spending too much money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear no--they seem to cost so little. But that I do it to THEM. I
ought to hold off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) thought again--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``The money you must be spending to
think it cheap! But I must be out of it--to the naked eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked for a moment as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) were really failing him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Then you
won't meet them?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had developed an unexpected
personal prudence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Who are they--first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why little Bilham to begin with.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) kept back for the moment Miss
Barrace. <div class="bookquote">``And Chad--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) comes--you must absolutely see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When then does he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When Bilham has had time to write him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>), and hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) about me.
Bilham, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``will report favourably--favourably for
Chad. That will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) not afraid to come. I want you the more
therefore, you see, for my bluff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you'll do yourself for your bluff.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was perfectly easy. <div class="bookquote">``At
the rate you've gone I'm quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``made one protest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) turned it over. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you been seeing what there's to protest
about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), with this, however ruefully, have the whole truth. <div class="bookquote">``I
haven't yet found a single thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't there any one WITH him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of the sort I came out about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether took a moment. <div class="bookquote">``How do I
know? And what do I care?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh oh!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) laughter spread. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was struck in fact by the effect
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) joke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw now how he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) meant it as a joke. SHE saw,
however, still other things, though in an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had hidden them.
<div class="bookquote">``You've got at no facts at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) tried to muster them. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has a lovely home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah that, in Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) quickly returned, <div class="bookquote">``proves nothing. That is
rather it DISproves nothing. They may very well, you see, the people
your mission is concerned with, have done it FOR him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. And it was on the scene of their doings then that Waymarsh
and I sat guzzling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh if you forbore to guzzle here on scenes of doings,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) replied,
<div class="bookquote">``you might easily die of starvation.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You've worse before you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah I've EVERYTHING before me. But on our hypothesis, you know, they
must be wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They ARE!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Gostrey. <div class="bookquote">``You're not therefore, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``wholly without facts. They've BEEN, in effect, wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To have got at something comparatively definite appeared at last a
little to help--a wave by which moreover, the next moment, recollection
was washed. <div class="bookquote">``My young man does admit furthermore that they're our
friend's great interest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the expression he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) uses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether more exactly recalled. <div class="bookquote">``No--not quite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something more vivid? Less?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had bent, with neared glasses, over a group of articles on a small
stand; and at this he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came up. ``It was a mere allusion, but, on the
lookout as I was, it struck me. <div class="bookquote">``Awful, you know, as Chad is'--those
were Bilham's words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Awful, you know'--? Oh!'' (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>--and Miss Gostrey turned them over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
seemed, however, satisfied. <div class="bookquote">``Well, what more do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) glanced once more at a bibelot or two, and everything sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) back.
<div class="bookquote">``But it is all the same as if they wished to let me have it between the
eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Quoi donc?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why what I speak of. The amenity. They can stun you with that as
well as with anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``you'll come round! I must see them each,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went
on, <div class="bookquote">``for myself. I mean Mr. Bilham and Mr. Newsome--Mr. Bilham
naturally first. Once only--once for each; that will do. But face to
face--for half an hour. What's Mr. Chad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) immediately pursued,
<div class="bookquote">``doing at Cannes? Decent men don't go to Cannes with the--well, with
the kind of ladies you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked with an interest in decent men that
amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, elsewhere, but not to Cannes. Cannes is different. Cannes is
better. Cannes is best. I mean it's all people you know--when you do
know them. And if HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) does, why that's different too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) must have
gone alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can't be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether confessed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) weakness, <div class="bookquote">``the least idea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>There seemed much in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was able after a little to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) to a nearer impression. The meeting with little Bilham took
place, by easy arrangement, in the great gallery of the Louvre; and
when, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) fellow visitor before one of the splendid
Titians--the overwhelming portrait of the young man with the
strangely-shaped glove and the blue-grey eyes--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to see the
third member of their party advance from the end of the waxed and
gilded vista, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a sense of having at last taken hold. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
agreed with Miss Gostrey--it dated even from Chester--for a morning at
the Louvre, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had embraced independently the same idea as thrown
out by little Bilham, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had already accompanied to the museum of
the Luxembourg. The fusion of these schemes presented no difficulty,
and it was to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) again that in little Bilham's company
contrarieties in general dropped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s all right--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s one of US!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey, after the first
exchange, soon found a chance to murmur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) companion; and Strether,
as they proceeded and paused and while a quick unanimity between the
two appeared to have phrased itself in half a dozen remarks--Strether
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew almost immediately what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) meant, and took it as
still another sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) job in hand. This was the more
grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could think of the intelligence now serving him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
as an acquisition positively new. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't have known even the day
before what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) meant--that is if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) meant, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) assumed, that they
were intense Americans together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had just worked round--and with a
sharper turn of the screw than any yet--to the conception of an
American intense as little Bilham was intense. The young man was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
first specimen; the specimen had profoundly perplexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>); at present
however there was light. It was by little Bilham's amazing serenity
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had at first been affected, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had inevitably, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
circumspection, felt it as the trail of the serpent, the corruption, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) might conveniently have said, of Europe; whereas the promptness with
which it came up for Miss Gostrey but as a special little form of the
oldest thing they knew justified it at once to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) own vision as well.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) wanted to be able to like his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) specimen with a clear good conscience,
and this fully permitted it. What had muddled him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was precisely the
small artist-man's way--it was so complete--of being more American than
anybody. But it now for the time put Strether vastly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ease to
have this view of a new way.

<p/>The amiable youth then looked out, as it had first struck Strether, at
a world in respect to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't a prejudice. The one our friend
most instantly missed was the usual one in favour of an occupation
accepted. Little Bilham had an occupation, but it was only an
occupation declined; and it was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) general exemption from alarm,
anxiety or remorse on this score that the impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) serenity
was made. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had come out to Paris to paint--to fathom, that is, at
large, that mystery; but study had been fatal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) so far as anything
COULD be fatal, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) productive power faltered in proportion as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
knowledge grew. Strether had gathered from him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that at the moment of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in Chad's rooms he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't saved from his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shipwreck a
scrap of anything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) beautiful intelligence and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) confirmed
habit of Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) referred to these things with an equal fond
familiarity, and it was sufficiently clear that, as an outfit, they
still served him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). They were charming to Strether through the hour
spent at the Louvre, where indeed they figured for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as an
unseparated part of the charged iridescent air, the glamour of the
name, the splendour of the space, the colour of the masters. Yet they
were present too wherever the young man led, and the day after the
visit to the Louvre they hung, in a different walk, about the steps of
our party. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had invited his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companions to cross the river with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
offering to show them his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own poor place; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own poor place, which
was very poor, gave to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) idiosyncrasies, for Strether--the small
sublime indifference and independences that had struck the latter as
fresh--an odd and engaging dignity. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived at the end of an alley
that went out of an old short cobbled street, a street that went in
turn out of a new long smooth avenue--street and avenue and alley
having, however, in common a sort of social shabbiness; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
introduced them to the rather cold and blank little studio which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
lent to a comrade for the term of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elegant absence. The comrade was
another ingenuous compatriot, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) had wired that tea was to
await them <div class="bookquote">``regardless,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and this reckless repast, and the second
ingenuous compatriot, and the faraway makeshift life, with its jokes
and its gaps, its delicate daubs and its three or four chairs, its
overflow of taste and conviction and its lack of nearly all else--these
things wove round the occasion a spell to which our hero unreservedly
surrendered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) liked the ingenuous compatriots--for two or three others soon
gathered; he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) liked the delicate daubs and the free
discriminations--involving references indeed, involving enthusiasms and
execrations that made him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), as they said, sit up; he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) liked above all the
legend of good-humoured poverty, of mutual accommodation fairly raised
to the romantic, that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) soon read into the scene. The ingenuous
compatriots showed a candour, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) thought, surpassing even the candour
of Woollett; they were red-haired and long-legged, they were quaint and
queer and dear and droll; they made the place resound with the
vernacular, which he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had never known so marked as when figuring for the
chosen language, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) must suppose, of contemporary art. They twanged
with a vengeance the aesthetic lyre--they drew from it wonderful airs.
This aspect of their life had an admirable innocence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) looked on
occasion at Maria Gostrey to see to what extent that element reached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) however for the hour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) the
previous day, no further sign than to show how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) dealt with boys;
meeting them with the air of old Parisian practice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had for
every one, for everything, in turn. Wonderful about the delicate daubs,
masterful about the way to make tea, trustful about the legs of chairs
and familiarly reminiscent of those, in the other time, the named, the
numbered or the caricatured, who had flourished or failed, disappeared
or arrived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had accepted with the best grace her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) second course of
little Bilham, and had said to Strether, the previous afternoon on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
leaving them, that, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) impression was to be renewed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would
reserve judgement till after the new evidence.

<p/>The new evidence was to come, as it proved, in a day or two. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) soon
had from Maria a message to the effect that an excellent box at the
Francais had been lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) for the following night; it seeming on such
occasions not the least of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) merits that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was subject to such
approaches. The sense of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was always paying for something in
advance was equalled on Strether's part only by the sense of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
was always being paid; all of which made for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) consciousness, in the
larger air, of a lively bustling traffic, the exchange of such values
as were not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to handle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew, at the French play,
anything but a box--just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hated at the English anything but a
stall; and a box was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was already in this phase girding himself
to press upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had for that matter her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) community with
little Bilham: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) too always, on the great issues, showed as having
known in time. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) constantly beforehand with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
mainly the chance to ask himself how on the day of their settlement
their account would stand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) endeavoured even now to keep it a little
straight by arranging that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) invitation she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) should
dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) first; but the upshot of this scruple was that at eight
o'clock on the morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) with Waymarsh under the pillared
portico. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hadn't dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>), and it was characteristic of their
relation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) refusal without in the least
understanding it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ever caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) rearrangements to affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) tenderest touches. It was on that principle for instance that,
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) the opportunity to be amiable again to little Bilham, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
had suggested his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) offering the young man a seat in their box. Strether
had dispatched for this purpose a small blue missive to the Boulevard
Malesherbes, but up to the moment of their passing into the theatre he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had received no response to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) message. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) held, however, even after
they had been for some time conveniently seated, that their friend, who
knew his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) way about, would come in at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own right moment. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
temporary absence moreover seemed, as never yet, to make the right
moment for Miss Gostrey. Strether had been waiting till tonight to get
back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in some mirrored form her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) impressions and conclusions.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had elected, as they said, to see little Bilham once; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) twice and had nevertheless not said more than a word.

<p/>Waymarsh meanwhile sat opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) with their hostess between; and
Miss Gostrey spoke of herself as an instructor of youth introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
little charges to a work that was one of the glories of literature. The
glory was happily unobjectionable, and the little charges were candid;
for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had travelled that road and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) merely waited on their
innocence. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) referred in due time to their absent friend, whom
it was clear they should have to give up. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) either won't have got
your note,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or you won't have got his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has had some kind
of hindrance, and, of course, for that matter, you know, a man never
writes about coming to a box.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) spoke as if, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) look, it
might have been Waymarsh who had written to the youth, and the latter's
face showed a mixture of austerity and anguish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) went on however as
if to meet this. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s far and away, you know, the best of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The best of whom, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why of all the long procession--the boys, the girls, or the old men
and old women as they sometimes really are; the hope, as one may say,
of our country. They've all passed, year after year; but there has
been no one in particular I've ever wanted to stop. I feel--don't
YOU?--that I want to stop little Bilham; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'s so exactly right as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
is.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) continued to talk to Waymarsh. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'s too delightful. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'ll only not spoil it! But they always WILL; they always do; they
always have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think Waymarsh knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``quite
what it's open to Bilham to spoil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be a good American,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh lucidly enough replied; <div class="bookquote">``for it
didn't strike me the young man had developed much in THAT shape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey sighed, <div class="bookquote">``the name of the good American is as easily
given as taken away! What IS it, to begin with, to BE one, and what's
the extraordinary hurry? Surely nothing that's so pressing was ever so
little defined. It's such an order, really, that before we cook you
the dish we must at least have your receipt. Besides the poor chicks
have time! What I've seen so often spoiled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``is the happy
attitude itself, the state of faith and--what shall I call it?--the
sense of beauty. You're right about him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) now took in Strether;
<div class="bookquote">``little Bilham has them to a charm, we must keep little Bilham along.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was all again for Waymarsh. <div class="bookquote">``The others have all wanted so
dreadfully to do something, and they've gone and done it in too many
cases indeed. It leaves them never the same afterwards; the charm's
always somehow broken. Now HE (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>), I think, you know, really won't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
won't do the least dreadful little thing. We shall continue to enjoy
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) is. No--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'s quite beautiful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) sees everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
isn't a bit ashamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) has every scrap of the courage of it that one
could ask. Only think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) MIGHT do. One wants really--for fear of
some accident--to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) in view. At this very moment perhaps what
mayn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) be up to? I've had my disappointments--the poor things are
never really safe; or only at least when you have them under your eye.
One can never completely trust them. One's uneasy, and I think that's
why I most miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had wound up with a laugh of enjoyment over her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) embroidery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
idea--an enjoyment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) face communicated to Strether, who almost
wished none the less at this moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) would let poor Waymarsh
alone. HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew more or less what she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) meant; but the fact wasn't a
reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) not pretending to Waymarsh that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't. It was
craven of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) perhaps, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would, for the high amenity of the
occasion, have liked Waymarsh not to be so sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wit. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
recognition of it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) away and, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) or
with that article, would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) worse. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), all the same, to
do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked across the box at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend; their eyes met; something
queer and stiff, something that bore on the situation but that it was
better not to touch, passed in silence between them. Well, the effect
of it for Strether was an abrupt reaction, a final impatience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
own tendency to temporise. Where was that taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) anyway? It was
one of the quiet instants that sometimes settle more matters than the
outbreaks dear to the historic muse. The only qualification of the
quietness was the synthetic <div class="bookquote">``Oh hang it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>into which Strether's share
of the silence soundlessly flowered. It represented, this mute
ejaculation, a final impulse to burn his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ships. These ships, to the
historic muse, may seem of course mere cockles, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) presently
spoke to Miss Gostrey it was with the sense at least of applying the
torch. <div class="bookquote">``Is it then a conspiracy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Between the two young men? Well, I don't pretend to be a seer or a
prophetess,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) presently replied; <div class="bookquote">``but if I'm simply a woman of sense
he (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>)'s working for you to-night. I don't quite know how--but it's in my
bones.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at last as if, little material as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
yet gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)'d really understand. ``For an opinion THAT<div class="bookquote">``S my
opinion. He (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) makes you out too well not to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to work for me to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Then I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>)
isn't doing anything very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've got you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) portentously answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean he (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) IS--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've got you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) merely repeated. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) disclaimed the
prophetic vision she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was at this instant the nearest approach he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
ever met to the priestess of the oracle. The light was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``You must face it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) faced it on the spot. <div class="bookquote">``They HAD arranged--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every move in the game. And they've been arranging ever since. He (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>)
has had every day his (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) little telegram from Cannes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It made Strether open his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Do you KNOW that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do better. I see it. This was, before I met him (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>), what I wondered
whether I WAS to see. But as soon as I met him (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) I ceased to wonder, and
our second meeting made me sure. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) all in. He (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) was acting--he (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>)
is still--on his (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) daily instructions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that Chad has done the whole thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh no--not the whole. WE<div class="bookquote">``VE done some of it. You and I and `Europe.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Europe--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether mused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear old Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed to explain. But there was more, and, with
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) turns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) risked it. <div class="bookquote">``And dear old Waymarsh. You,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
declared, <div class="bookquote">``have been a good bit of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sat massive. <div class="bookquote">``A good bit of what, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why of the wonderful consciousness of our friend here. You've helped
too in your way to float him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where the devil IS he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) passed it on with a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Where the devil, Strether, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had just been thinking it out. <div class="bookquote">``Well, quite already
in Chad's hands, it would seem.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had had with this another
thought. <div class="bookquote">``Will that be--just all through Bilham--the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'s going to
work it? It would be, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>), you know, an idea. And Chad with an
idea--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked while the image held him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, is Chad--what shall I say?--monstrous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh as much as you like! But the idea you speak of,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``won't
have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) best. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'ll have a better. It won't be all through
little Bilham that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'ll work it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This already sounded almost like a hope destroyed. <div class="bookquote">``Through whom else
then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what we shall see!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But quite as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) turned, and
Strether turned; for the door of the box had opened, with the click of
the ouvreuse, from the lobby, and a gentleman, a stranger to them, had
come in with a quick step. The door closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and, though
their faces showed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mistake, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) air, which was striking, was
all good confidence. The curtain had just again arisen, and, in the
hush of the general attention, Strether's challenge was tacit, as was
also the greeting, with a quickly deprecating hand and smile, of the
unannounced visitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) discreetly signed that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would wait, would
stand, and these things and his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) face, one look from which she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
caught, had suddenly worked for Miss Gostrey. She (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fitted to them all
an answer for Strether's last question. The solid stranger was simply
the answer--as she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) now, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friend, indicated. She (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brought
it straight out for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--it presented the intruder. <div class="bookquote">``Why, through this
gentleman!''  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div>The gentleman indeed, at the same time, though sounding
for Strether a very short name, did practically as much to explain.
Strether gasped the name back--then only had he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seen Miss Gostrey had
said more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) knew. They were in presence of Chad himself.

<p/>Our friend was to go over it afterwards again and again--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was going
over it much of the time that they were together, and they were
together constantly for three or four days: the note had been so
strongly struck during that first half-hour that everything happening
since was comparatively a minor development. The fact was that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
perception of the young man's identity--so absolutely checked for a
minute--had been quite one of the sensations that count in life; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
certainly had never known one that had acted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might have said,
with more of a crowded rush. And the rush though both vague and
multitudinous, had lasted a long time, protected, as it were, yet at
the same time aggravated, by the circumstance of its coinciding with a
stretch of decorous silence. They couldn't talk without disturbing the
spectators in the part of the balcony just below them; and it, for that
matter, came to Strether--being a thing of the sort that did come to
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--that these were the accidents of a high civilisation; the imposed
tribute to propriety, the frequent exposure to conditions, usually
brilliant, in which relief has to await its time. Relief was never
quite near at hand for kings, queens, comedians and other such people,
and though you might be yourself not exactly one of those, you could
yet, in leading the life of high pressure, guess a little how they
sometimes felt. It was truly the life of high pressure that Strether
had seemed to feel himself lead while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sat there, close to Chad,
during the long tension of the act. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was in presence of a fact that
occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) whole mind, that occupied for the half-hour his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) senses
themselves all together; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) couldn't without inconvenience show
anything--which moreover might count really as luck. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might
have shown, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) shown at all, was exactly the kind of emotion--the
emotion of bewilderment--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had proposed to himself from the
first, whatever should occur, to show least. The phenomenon that had
suddenly sat down there with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was a phenomenon of change so complete
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) imagination, which had worked so beforehand, felt itself, in
the connexion, without margin or allowance. It had faced every
contingency but that Chad should not BE Chad, and this was what it now
had to face with a mere strained smile and an uncomfortable flush.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) asked himself if, by any chance, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should have in some way
to commit himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mind settled to the new vision,
might habituate it, so to speak, to the remarkable truth. But oh it was
too remarkable, the truth; for what could be more remarkable than this
sharp rupture of an identity? You could deal with a man as
himself--you couldn't deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as somebody else. It was a small
source of peace moreover to be reduced to wondering how little he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
know in such an event what a sum he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was setting you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't
absolutely not know, for you couldn't absolutely not let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was a
CASE then simply, a strong case, as people nowadays called such
things,'' a case of transformation unsurpassed, and the hope was but in
the general law that strong cases were liable to control from without.
Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Strether himself, was the only person after all aware of
it. Even Miss Gostrey, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) science, wouldn't be, would
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)?--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never seen any one less aware of anything than
Waymarsh as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) glowered at Chad. The social sightlessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) old
friend's survey marked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) afresh, and almost in an humiliating
way, the inevitable limits of direct aid from this source. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was not
certain, however, of not drawing a shade of compensation from the
privilege, as yet untasted, of knowing more about something in
particular than Miss Gostrey did. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) situation too was a case, for
that matter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was now so interested, quite so privately agog,
about it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had already an eye to the fun it would be to open up
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) derived during his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) half-hour no assistance from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), and just this fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) not meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) eyes played a little, it
must be confessed, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) predicament.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had introduced Chad, in the first minutes, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) breath, and
there was never the primness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) of the person unacquainted; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
had none the less betrayed at first no vision but of the stage, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) occasionally found a pretext for an appreciative moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
invited Waymarsh to share. The latter's faculty of participation had
never had, all round, such an assault to meet; the pressure on him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
being the sharper for this chosen attitude in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), as Strether judged
it, of isolating, for their natural intercourse, Chad and himself. This
intercourse was meanwhile restricted to a frank friendly look from the
young man, something markedly like a smile, but falling far short of a
grin, and to the vivacity of Strether's private speculation as to
whether HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) carried himself like a fool. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't quite see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
could so feel as one without somehow showing as one. The worst of that
question moreover was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew it as a symptom the sense of which
annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If I'm going to be odiously conscious of how I may
strike the fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) reflected, <div class="bookquote">``it was so little what I came out for
that I may as well stop before I begin.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This sage consideration too,
distinctly, seemed to leave untouched the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) WAS going to be
conscious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was conscious of everything but of what would have
served him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to know afterwards, in the watches of the night, that nothing
would have been more open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) than after a minute or two to propose
to Chad to seek with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) the refuge of the lobby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't only not
proposed it, but had lacked even the presence of mind to see it as
possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had stuck there like a schoolboy wishing not to miss a
minute of the show; though for that portion of the show then presented
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't had an instant's real attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) couldn't when the
curtain fell have given the slightest account of what had happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had therefore, further, not at that moment acknowledged the amenity
added by this acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) awkwardness to Chad's general patience.
Hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) none the less known at the very time--known it stupidly and
without reaction--that the boy was accepting something? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
modestly benevolent, the boy--that was at least what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been
capable of the superiority of making out his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chance to be; and one had
one's self literally not had the gumption to get in ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). If
we should go into all that occupied our friend in the watches of the
night we should have to mend our pen; but an instance or two may mark
for us the vividness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could remember. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) remembered the
two absurdities that, if his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) presence of mind HAD failed, were the
things that had had most to do with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life seen
a young man come into a box at ten o'clock at night, and would, if
challenged on the question in advance, have scarce been ready to
pronounce as to different ways of doing so. But it was in spite of
this definite to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that Chad had had a way that was wonderful: a
fact carrying with it an implication that, as one might imagine it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had learned, how.

<p/>Here already then were abounding results; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had on the spot and
without the least trouble of intention taught Strether that even in so
small a thing as that there were different ways. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had done in the
same line still more than this; had by a mere shake or two of the head
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) old friend observe that the change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was perhaps more
than anything else, for the eye, a matter of the marked streaks of
grey, extraordinary at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) age, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thick black hair; as well as
that this new feature was curiously becoming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), did something for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), as characterisation, also even--of all things in the world--as
refinement, that had been a good deal wanted. Strether felt, however,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have had to confess, that it wouldn't have been easy just now,
on this and other counts, in the presence of what had been supplied, to
be quite clear as to what had been missed. A reflexion a candid critic
might have made of old, for instance, was that it would have been
happier for the son to look more like the mother; but this was a
reflexion that at present would never occur. The ground had quite
fallen away from it, yet no resemblance whatever to the mother had
supervened. It would have been hard for a young man's face and air to
disconnect themselves more completely than Chad's at this juncture from
any discerned, from any imaginable aspect of a New England female
parent. That of course was no more than had been on the cards; but it
produced in Strether none the less one of those frequent phenomena of
mental reference with which all judgement in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was actually beset.

<p/>Again and again as the days passed he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had had a sense of the pertinence
of communicating quickly with Woollett--communicating with a quickness
with which telegraphy alone would rhyme; the fruit really of a fine
fancy in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) for keeping things straight, for the happy forestalment of
error. No one could explain better when needful, nor put more
conscience into an account or a report; which burden of conscience is
perhaps exactly the reason why his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) heart always sank when the clouds of
explanation gathered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) highest ingenuity was in keeping the sky of
life clear of them. Whether or no he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had a grand idea of the lucid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
held that nothing ever was in fact--for any one else--explained. One
went through the vain motions, but it was mostly a waste of life. A
personal relation was a relation only so long as people either
perfectly understood or, better still, didn't care if they didn't. From
the moment they cared if they didn't it was living by the sweat of
one's brow; and the sweat of one's brow was just what one might buy
one's self off from by keeping the ground free of the wild weed of
delusion. It easily grew too fast, and the Atlantic cable now alone
could race with it. That agency would each day have testified for him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)
to something that was not what Woollett had argued. He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) was not at this
moment absolutely sure that the effect of the morrow's--or rather of
the night's--appreciation of the crisis wouldn't be to determine some
brief missive. <div class="bookquote">``Have at last seen him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), but oh dear!'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--some temporary
relief of that sort seemed to hover before him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>). It hovered somehow as
preparing them all--yet preparing them for what? If he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) might do so
more luminously and cheaply he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) would tick out in four words: <div class="bookquote">``Awfully
old--grey hair.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To this particular item in Chad's appearance he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
constantly, during their mute half-hour, reverted; as if so very much
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could have said had been involved in it. The most he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
could have said would have been: <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s going to make me feel
young--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which indeed, however, carried with it quite enough. If
Strether was to feel young, that is, it would be because Chad was to
feel old; and an aged and hoary sinner had been no part of the scheme.

<p/>The question of Chadwick's true time of life was, doubtless, what came
up quickest after the adjournment of the two, when the play was over,
to a cafe in the Avenue de l``Opera. Miss Gostrey had in due course
been perfect for such a step; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had known exactly what they
wanted--to go straight somewhere and talk; and Strether had even felt
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had known what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wished to say and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was arranging
immediately to begin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) hadn't pretended this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) HAD pretended
on the other hand, to have divined Waymarsh's wish to extend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) an
independent protection homeward; but Strether nevertheless found how,
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had Chad opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) at a small table in the brilliant
halls that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion straightway selected, sharply and easily
discriminated from others, it was quite, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mind, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) speak; as if, sitting up, a mile away, in the little apartment he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) would listen hard enough to catch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) found too that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
liked that idea, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wished that, by the same token, Mrs. Newsome
might have caught as well. For what had above all been determined in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as a necessity of the first order was not to lose another hour, nor
a fraction of one; was to advance, to overwhelm, with a rush. This was
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would anticipate--by a night-attack, as might be--any forced
maturity that a crammed consciousness of Paris was likely to take upon
itself to assert on behalf of the boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew to the full, on what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
had just extracted from Miss Gostrey, Chad's marks of alertness; but
they were a reason the more for not dawdling. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was himself
moreover to be treated as young he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wouldn't at all events be so treated
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should have struck out at least once. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) arms might be
pinioned afterwards, but it would have been left on record that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was
fifty. The importance of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had indeed begun to feel before they
left the theatre; it had become a wild unrest, urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to seize his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
chance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could scarcely wait for it as they went; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was on the
verge of the indecency of bringing up the question in the street; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
fairly caught himself going on--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) afterwards invidiously named
it--as if there would be for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) no second chance should the present be
lost. Not till, on the purple divan before the perfunctory bock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had brought out the words themselves, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sure, for that matter,
that the present would be saved.





<p/>Book Fourth




<p/>I


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come, you know, to make you break with everything, neither more
nor less, and take you straight home; so you'll be so good as
immediately and favourably to consider it!'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--Strether, face to face
with Chad after the play, had sounded these words almost breathlessly,
and with an effect at first positively disconcerting to himself alone.
For Chad's receptive attitude was that of a person who had been
gracefully quiet while the messenger at last reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has run a
mile through the dust. During some seconds after he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had spoken
Strether felt as if HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had made some such exertion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was not even
certain that the perspiration wasn't on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) brow. It was the kind of
consciousness for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had to thank the look that, while the strain
lasted, the young man's eyes gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). They reflected--and the deuce
of the thing was that they reflected really with a sort of shyness of
kindness--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) momentarily disordered state; which fact brought on in
its turn for our friend the dawn of a fear that Chad might simply <div class="bookquote">``take
it out'' (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>--take everything out--in being sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). Such a fear, any
fear, was unpleasant. But everything was unpleasant; it was odd how
everything had suddenly turned so. This however was no reason for
letting the least thing go. Strether had the next minute proceeded as
roundly as if with an advantage to follow up. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm a
busybody, if you want to fight the case to the death; but after all
mainly in the sense of having known you and having given you such
attention as you kindly permitted when you were in jackets and
knickerbockers. Yes--it was knickerbockers, I'm busybody enough to
remember that; and that you had, for your age--I speak of the first
far-away time--tremendously stout legs. Well, we want you to break.
Your mother's heart's passionately set upon it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has above and
beyond that excellent arguments and reasons. I've not put them into
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head--I needn't remind you how little she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s a person who needs
that. But they exist--you must take it from me as a friend both of
hers and yours--for myself as well. I didn't invent them, I didn't
originally work them out; but I understand them, I think I can explain
them--by which I mean make you actively do them justice; and that's why
you see me here. You had better know the worst at once. It's a
question of an immediate rupture and an immediate return. I've been
conceited enough to dream I can sugar that pill. I take at any rate
the greatest interest in the question. I took it already before I left
home, and I don't mind telling you that, altered as you are, I take it
still more now that I've seen you. You're older and--I don't know what
to call it!--more of a handful; but you're by so much the more, I seem
to make out, to our purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I strike you as improved?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether was to recall that Chad had at
this point enquired.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was likewise to recall--and it had to count for some time as his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
greatest comfort--that it had been <div class="bookquote">``given''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), as they said at
Woollett, to reply with some presence of mind: <div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least
idea.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was really for a while to like thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been
positively hard. On the point of conceding that Chad had improved in
appearance, but that to the question of appearance the remark must be
confined, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) checked even that compromise and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) reservation
bare. Not only his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) moral, but also, as it were, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) aesthetic sense
had a little to pay for this, Chad being unmistakeably--and wasn't it a
matter of the confounded grey hair again?--handsomer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had ever
promised. That however fell in perfectly with what Strether had said.
They had no desire to keep down his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) proper expansion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't
be less to their purpose for not looking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had too often done of
old, only bold and wild. There was indeed a signal particular in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would distinctly be more so. Strether didn't, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) talked,
absolutely follow himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) only knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thread and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) held it from moment to moment a little tighter; his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mere
uninterruptedness during the few minutes helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to do that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
frequently for a month, turned over what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should say on this very
occasion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed at last to have said nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had thought
of--everything was so totally different.

<p/>But in spite of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had put the flag at the window. This was what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had done, and there was a minute during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) affected himself as
having shaken it hard, flapped it with a mighty flutter, straight in
front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's nose. It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really almost the sense of
having already acted his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) part. The momentary relief--as if from the
knowledge that nothing of THAT at least could be undone--sprang from a
particular cause, the cause that had flashed into operation, in Miss
Gostrey's box, with direct apprehension, with amazed recognition, and
that had been concerned since then in every throb of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) consciousness.
What it came to was that with an absolutely new quantity to deal with
one simply couldn't know. The new quantity was represented by the fact
that Chad had been made over. That was all; whatever it was it was
everything. Strether had never seen the thing so done before--it was
perhaps a speciality of Paris. If one had been present at the process
one might little by little have mastered the result; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was face to
face, as matters stood, with the finished business. It had freely been
noted for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might be received as a dog among skittles, but
that was on the basis of the old quantity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had originally thought of
lines and tones as things to be taken, but these possibilities had now
quite melted away. There was no computing at all what the young man
before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would think or feel or say on any subject whatever. This
intelligence Strether had afterwards, to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nervousness,
reconstituted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had also reconstituted the
promptness with which Chad had corrected his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) uncertainty. An
extraordinarily short time had been required for the correction, and
there had ceased to be anything negative in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion's face and
air as soon as it was made. <div class="bookquote">``Your engagement to my mother has become
then what they call here a fait accompli?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--it had consisted, the
determinant touch, in nothing more than that.

<p/>Well, that was enough, Strether had felt while his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) answer hung fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had felt at the same time, however, that nothing could less become him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
than that it should hang fire too long. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said brightly, <div class="bookquote">``it
was on the happy settlement of the question that I started. You see
therefore to what tune I'm in your family. Moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I've
been supposing you'd suppose it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I've been supposing it for a long time, and what you tell me helps
me to understand that you should want to do something. To do
something, I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``to commemorate an event so--what do
they call it?--so auspicious. I see you make out, and not
unnaturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that bringing me home in triumph as a sort
of wedding-present to Mother would commemorate it better than anything
else. You want to make a bonfire in fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``and you pitch
me on. Thank you, thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) laughed again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was altogether easy about it, and this made Strether now see how at
bottom, and in spite of the shade of shyness that really cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had from the first moment been easy about everything. The
shade of shyness was mere good taste. People with manners formed could
apparently have, as one of their best cards, the shade of shyness too.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had leaned a little forward to speak; his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) elbows were on the table;
and the inscrutable new face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had got somewhere and somehow was
brought by the movement nearer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) critics There was a fascination
for that critic in its not being, this ripe physiognomy, the face that,
under observation at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had originally carried away from
Woollett. Strether found a certain freedom on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own side in defining
it as that of a man of the world--a formula that indeed seemed to come
now in some degree to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) relief; that of a man to whom things had
happened and were variously known. In gleams, in glances, the past did
perhaps peep out of it; but such lights were faint and instantly
merged. Chad was brown and thick and strong, and of old Chad had been
rough. Was all the difference therefore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was actually smooth?
Possibly; for that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) WAS smooth was as marked as in the taste of a
sauce or in the rub of a hand. The effect of it was general--it had
retouched his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) features, drawn them with a cleaner line. It had cleared
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) eyes and settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) colour and polished his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fine square teeth--the
main ornament of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) face; and at the same time that it had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a
form and a surface, almost a design, it had toned his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) voice,
established his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) accent, encouraged his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) smile to more play and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) other
motions to less. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had formerly, with a great deal of action,
expressed very little; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) now expressed whatever was necessary with
almost none at all. It was as if in short he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had really, copious
perhaps but shapeless, been put into a firm mould and turned
successfully out. The phenomenon--Strether kept eyeing it as a
phenomenon, an eminent case--was marked enough to be touched by the
finger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) finally put his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand across the table and laid it on Chad's
arm. <div class="bookquote">``If you'll promise me--here on the spot and giving me your word of
honour--to break straight off, you'll make the future the real right
thing for all of us alike. You'll ease off the strain of this decent
but none the less acute suspense in which I've for so many days been
waiting for you, and let me turn in to rest. I shall leave you with my
blessing and go to bed in peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad again fell back at this and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hands pocketed, settled himself a
little; in which posture he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) looked, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) rather anxiously smiled,
only the more earnest. Then Strether seemed to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was really
nervous, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took that as what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have called a wholesome
sign. The only mark of it hitherto had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) more than once taking
off and putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wide-brimmed crush hat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had at this moment
made the motion again to remove it, then had only pushed it back, so
that it hung informally on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) strong young grizzled crop. It was a
touch that gave the note of the familiar--the intimate and the
belated--to their quiet colloquy; and it was indeed by some such
trivial aid that Strether became aware at the same moment of something
else. The observation was at any rate determined in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) by some light
too fine to distinguish from so many others, but it was none the less
sharply determined. Chad looked unmistakeably during these
instants--well, as Strether put it to himself, all he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was worth. Our
friend had a sudden apprehension of what that would on certain sides
be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in a flash as the young man marked out by women; and for
a concentrated minute the dignity, the comparative austerity, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
funnily fancied it, of this character affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost with awe.
There was an experience on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interlocutor's part that looked out at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) from under the displaced hat, and that looked out moreover by a
force of its own, the deep fact of its quantity and quality, and not
through Chad's intending bravado or swagger. That was then the way men
marked out by women WERE--and also the men by whom the women were
doubtless in turn sufficiently distinguished. It affected Strether for
thirty seconds as a relevant truth, a truth which, however, the next
minute, had fallen into its relation. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you imagine there being
some questions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad asked, <div class="bookquote">``that a fellow--however much impressed by
your charming way of stating things--would like to put to you first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--easily. I'm here to answer everything. I think I can even
tell you things, of the greatest interest to you, that you won't know
enough to ask me. We'll take as many days to it as you like. But I
want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether wound up, <div class="bookquote">``to go to bed now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad had spoken in such surprise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was amused. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you
believe it?--with what you put me through?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man seemed to consider. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I haven't put you through
much--yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean there's so much more to come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed. <div class="bookquote">``All
the more reason then that I should gird myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as if to mark
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could by this time count on he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was already on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feet.

<p/>Chad, still seated, stayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), with a hand against him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) passed
between their table and the next. <div class="bookquote">``Oh we shall get on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>The tone was, as who should say, everything Strether could have
desired; and quite as good the expression of face with which the
speaker had looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) and kindly held him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>). All these things
lacked was their not showing quite so much as the fruit of experience.
Yes, experience was what Chad did play on him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't play any
grossness of defiance. Of course experience was in a manner defiance;
but it wasn't, at any rate--rather indeed quite the
contrary!--grossness; which was so much gained. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fairly grew older,
Strether thought, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself so reasoned. Then with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mature
pat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) visitor's arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) also got up; and there had been enough of
it all by this time to make the visitor feel that something WAS
settled. Wasn't it settled that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had at least the testimony of
Chad's own belief in a settlement? Strether found himself treating
Chad's profession that they would get on as a sufficient basis for
going to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't nevertheless after this gone to bed directly;
for when they had again passed out together into the mild bright night
a check had virtually sprung from nothing more than a small
circumstance which might have acted only as confirming quiescence.
There were people, expressive sound, projected light, still abroad, and
after they had taken in for a moment, through everything, the great
clear architectural street, they turned off in tacit union to the
quarter of Strether's hotel. <div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad here abruptly began,
<div class="bookquote">``of course Mother's making things out with you about me has been
natural--and of course also you've had a good deal to go upon. Still,
you must have filled out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had stopped, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) friend to wonder a little what point he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
wished to make; and this it was that enabled Strether meanwhile to make
one. <div class="bookquote">``Oh we've never pretended to go into detail. We weren't in the
least bound to THAT. It was `filling out' enough to miss you as we
did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>But Chad rather oddly insisted, though under the high lamp at their
corner, where they paused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had at first looked as if touched by
Strether's allusion to the long sense, at home, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) absence. <div class="bookquote">``What
I mean is you must have imagined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Imagined what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--horrors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether horrors</b></font>)</div><p/>It affected Strether: horrors were so little--superficially at
least--in this robust and reasoning image. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was none the less
there to be veracious. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I dare say we HAVE imagined horrors. But
where's the harm if we haven't been wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) face to the lamp, and it was one of the moments at
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) extraordinary way, most his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) air of designedly
showing himself. It was as if at these instants he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) just presented
himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) identity so rounded off, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) palpable presence and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
massive young manhood, as such a link in the chain as might practically
amount to a kind of demonstration. It was as if--and how but
anomalously?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) couldn't after all help thinking sufficiently well of
these things to let them go for what they were worth. What could there
be in this for Strether but the hint of some self-respect, some sense
of power, oddly perverted; something latent and beyond access, ominous
and perhaps enviable? The intimation had the next thing, in a flash,
taken on a name--a name on which our friend seized as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked himself
if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) weren't perhaps really dealing with an irreducible young Pagan.
This description--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) quite jumped at it--had a sound that gratified his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
mental ear, so that of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had already adopted it. Pagan--yes,
that was, wasn't it? what Chad WOULD logically be. It was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
must be. It was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was. The idea was a clue and, instead of
darkening the prospect, projected a certain clearness. Strether made
out in this quick ray that a Pagan was perhaps, at the pass they had
come to, the thing most wanted at Woollett. They'd be able to do with
one--a good one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)'d find an opening--yes; and Strether's imagination
even now prefigured and accompanied the first appearance there of the
rousing personage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had only the slight discomfort of feeling, as the
young man turned away from the lamp, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought had in the
momentary silence possibly been guessed. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I've no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said
Chad, <div class="bookquote">``you've come near enough. The details, as you say, don't matter.
It HAS been generally the case that I've let myself go. But I'm coming
round--I'm not so bad now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>With which they walked on again to
Strether's hotel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the latter asked as they approached the door, <div class="bookquote">``that
there isn't any woman with you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But pray what has that to do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why it's the whole question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of my going home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad was clearly surprised. <div class="bookquote">``Oh not much! Do you
think that when I want to go any one will have any power--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To keep you'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether took him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) straight up--``from carrying out your
wish? Well, our idea has been that somebody has hitherto--or a good
many persons perhaps--kept you pretty well from ``wanting.<div class="bookquote">'' That's
what--if you're in anybody's hands--may again happen. You don't answer
my question'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) kept it up; <div class="bookquote">``but if you aren't in anybody's hands so
much the better. There's nothing then but what makes for your going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad turned this over. <div class="bookquote">``I don't answer your question?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) spoke quite
without resenting it. ``Well, such questions have always a rather
exaggerated side. One doesn't know quite what you mean by being in
women's ``hands.<div class="bookquote">'' It's all so vague. One is when one isn't. One isn't
when one is. And then one can't quite give people away.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) seemed
kindly to explain. <div class="bookquote">``I've NEVER got stuck--so very hard; and, as
against anything at any time really better, I don't think I've ever
been afraid.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>There was something in it that held Strether to wonder,
and this gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) time to go on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) broke out as with a more helpful
thought. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know how I like Paris itself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>The upshot was indeed to make our friend marvel. ``Oh if THAT<div class="bookquote">``S all
that's the matter with you--!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was HE (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) who almost showed resentment.

<p/>Chad's smile of a truth more than met it. <div class="bookquote">``But isn't that enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated, but it came out. <div class="bookquote">``Not enough for your mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Spoken, however, it sounded a trifle odd--the effect of which was that
Chad broke into a laugh. Strether, at this, succumbed as well, though
with extreme brevity. <div class="bookquote">``Permit us to have still our theory. But if you
ARE so free and so strong you're inexcusable. I'll write in the
morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added with decision. <div class="bookquote">``I'll say I've got you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>This appeared to open for Chad a new interest. <div class="bookquote">``How often do you
write?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh perpetually.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And at great length?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had become a little impatient. <div class="bookquote">``I hope it's not found too
great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I'm sure not. And you hear as often?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Strether paused. <div class="bookquote">``As often as I deserve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother writes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``a lovely letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, before the closed porte-cochere, fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``It's
more, my boy, than YOU do! But our suppositions don't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``if you're actually not entangled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad's pride seemed none the less a little touched. <div class="bookquote">``I never WAS
that--let me insist. I always had my own way.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) pursued:
<div class="bookquote">``And I have it at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what are you here for? What has kept you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked, <div class="bookquote">``if
you HAVE been able to leave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It made Chad, after a stare, throw himself back. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think one's
kept only by women?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) surprise and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) verbal emphasis rang out so
clear in the still street that Strether winced till he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) remembered the
safety of their English speech. <div class="bookquote">``Is that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man demanded,
<div class="bookquote">``what they think at Woollett?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>At the good faith in the question
Strether had changed colour, feeling that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) foot in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had appeared stupidly to misrepresent what
they thought at Woollett; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had time to rectify Chad again
was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I must say then you show a low mind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It so fell in, unhappily for Strether, with that reflexion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own
prompted in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) by the pleasant air of the Boulevard Malesherbes, that
its disconcerting force was rather unfairly great. It was a dig that,
administered by himself--and administered even to poor Mrs.
Newsome--was no more than salutary; but administered by Chad--and quite
logically--it came nearer drawing blood. They HADn't a low mind--nor
any approach to one; yet incontestably they had worked, and with a
certain smugness, on a basis that might be turned against them. Chad
had at any rate pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) visitor up; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had even pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
admirable mother; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had absolutely, by a turn of the wrist and a jerk
of the far-flung noose, pulled up, in a bunch, Woollett browsing in its
pride. There was no doubt Woollett HAD insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) coarseness; and
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) at present stood there for in the sleeping street was, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
manner of striking the other note, to make of such insistence a
preoccupation compromising to the insisters. It was exactly as if they
had imputed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a vulgarity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had by a mere gesture caused to
fall from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). The devil of the case was that Strether felt it, by the
same stroke, as falling straight upon himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been wondering a
minute ago if the boy weren't a Pagan, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) found himself wondering
now if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) weren't by chance a gentleman. It didn't in the least, on
the spot, spring up helpfully for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that a person couldn't at the
same time be both. There was nothing at this moment in the air to
challenge the combination; there was everything to give it on the
contrary something of a flourish. It struck Strether into the bargain
as doing something to meet the most difficult of the questions; though
perhaps indeed only by substituting another. Wouldn't it be precisely
by having learned to be a gentleman that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had mastered the consequent
trick of looking so well that one could scarce speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) straight?
But what in the world was the clue to such a prime producing cause?
There were too many clues then that Strether still lacked, and these
clues to clues were among them. What it accordingly amounted to for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had to take full in the face a fresh attribution of
ignorance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had grown used by this time to reminders, especially
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own lips, of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had borne them
because in the first place they were private and because in the second
they practically conveyed a tribute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't know what was bad,
and--as others didn't know how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew it--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could put up with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) state. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't know, in so important a particular, what
was good, Chad at least was now aware he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't; and that, for some
reason, affected our friend as curiously public. It was in fact an
exposed condition that the young man left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in long enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
feel its chill--till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw fit, in a word, generously again to cover
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). This last was in truth what Chad quite gracefully did. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
did it as with a simple thought that met the whole of the case. <div class="bookquote">``Oh
I'm all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>It was what Strether had rather bewilderedly to go to
bed on.



<p/>II


<p/>It really looked true moreover from the way Chad was to behave after
this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was full of attentions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother's ambassador; in spite
of which, all the while, the latter's other relations rather remarkably
contrived to assert themselves. Strether's sittings pen in hand with
Mrs. Newsome up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own room were broken, yet they were richer; and
they were more than ever interspersed with the hours in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
reported himself, in a different fashion, but with scarce less
earnestness and fulness, to Maria Gostrey. Now that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have
expressed it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had really something to talk about he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found himself,
in respect to any oddity that might reside for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in the double
connexion, at once more aware and more indifferent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been fine
to Mrs. Newsome about his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) useful friend, but it had begun to haunt his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
imagination that Chad, taking up again for her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) benefit a pen too long
disused, might possibly be finer. It wouldn't at all do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw, that
anything should come up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at Chad's hand but what specifically
was to have come; the greatest divergence from which would be precisely
the element of any lubrication of their intercourse by levity It was
accordingly to forestall such an accident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) frankly put before
the young man the several facts, just as they had occurred, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
funny alliance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke of these facts, pleasantly and obligingly, as
<div class="bookquote">``the whole story,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might qualify the alliance as funny
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained sufficiently grave about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flattered himself that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even exaggerated the wild freedom of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) original encounter with the
wonderful lady; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was scrupulously definite about the absurd
conditions in which they had made acquaintance--their having picked
each other up almost in the street; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had -LRB-finest inspiration of
all!-RRB- a conception of carrying the war into the enemy's country by
showing surprise at the enemy's ignorance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had always had a notion that this last was the grand style of
fighting; the greater therefore the reason for it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't
remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever before fought in the grand style. Every one,
according to this, knew Miss Gostrey: how came it Chad didn't know
her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? The difficulty, the impossibility, was really to escape it;
Strether put on him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took for granted, the burden of proof
of the contrary. This tone was so far successful as that Chad quite
appeared to recognise her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a person whose fame had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), but
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) acquaintance with whom much mischance had worked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) made
the point at the same time that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) social relations, such as they
could be called, were perhaps not to the extent Strether supposed with
the rising flood of their compatriots. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hinted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) having more
and more given way to a different principle of selection; the moral of
which seemed to be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) went about little in the <div class="bookquote">``colony.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For the
moment certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had quite another interest. It was deep, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
understood, and Strether, for himself, could only so observe it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
couldn't see as yet how deep. Might he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) not all too soon! For there was
really too much of their question that Chad had already committed
himself to liking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) liked, to begin with, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) prospective
stepfather; which was distinctly what had not been on the cards. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
hating him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was the untowardness for which Strether had been best
prepared; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't expected the boy's actual form to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) more to
do than his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) imputed. It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) more through suggesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) must
somehow make up to himself for not being sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was sufficiently
disagreeable. That had really been present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) only way to
be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was sufficiently thorough. The point was that if Chad's
tolerance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thoroughness were insincere, were but the best of
devices for gaining time, it none the less did treat everything as
tacitly concluded.

<p/>That seemed at the end of ten days the upshot of the abundant, the
recurrent talk through which Strether poured into him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) all it concerned
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to know, put him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in full possession of facts and figures. Never
cutting these colloquies short by a minute, Chad behaved, looked and
spoke as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) were rather heavily, perhaps even a trifle gloomily, but
none the less fundamentally and comfortably free. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) made no crude
profession of eagerness to yield, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) asked the most intelligent
questions, probed, at moments, abruptly, even deeper than his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) friend's
layer of information, justified by these touches the native estimate of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) latent stuff, and had in every way the air of trying to live,
reflectively, into the square bright picture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) walked up and down in
front of this production, sociably took Strether's arm at the points at
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stopped, surveyed it repeatedly from the right and from the
left, inclined a critical head to either quarter, and, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) puffed
a still more critical cigarette, animadverted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion on this
passage and that. Strether sought relief--there were hours when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
required it--in repeating himself; it was in truth not to be blinked
that Chad had a way. The main question as yet was of what it was a way
TO. It made vulgar questions no more easy; but that was unimportant
when all questions save those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own asking had dropped. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
was free was answer enough, and it wasn't quite ridiculous that this
freedom should end by presenting itself as what was difficult to move.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) changed state, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) lovely home, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) beautiful things, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) easy
talk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) very appetite for Strether, insatiable and, when all was
said, flattering--what were such marked matters all but the notes of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) freedom? He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had the effect of making a sacrifice of it just in
these handsome forms to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) visitor; which was mainly the reason the
visitor was privately, for the time, a little out of countenance.
Strether was at this period again and again thrown back on a felt need
to remodel somehow his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fairly caught himself shooting rueful
glances, shy looks of pursuit, toward the embodied influence, the
definite adversary, who had by a stroke of her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) own failed him (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) and on a
fond theory of whose palpable presence he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) had, under Mrs. Newsome's
inspiration, altogether proceeded. He (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) had once or twice, in secret,
literally expressed the irritated wish that SHE would come out and find
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) couldn't quite yet force it upon Woollett that such a career, such a
perverted young life, showed after all a certain plausible side, DID in
the case before them flaunt something like an impunity for the social
man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could at least treat himself to the statement that would
prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the sharpest echo. This echo--as distinct over there in
the dry thin air as some shrill <div class="bookquote">``heading''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>above a column of
print--seemed to reach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says there's no
woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear Mrs. Newsome report, in capitals almost of
newspaper size, to Mrs. Pocock; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could focus in Mrs. Pocock the
response of the reader of the journal. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see in the younger
lady's face the earnestness of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attention and catch the full
scepticism of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) but slightly delayed <div class="bookquote">``What is there then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Just so
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could again as little miss the mother's clear decision: <div class="bookquote">``There's
plenty of disposition, no doubt, to pretend there isn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>Strether
had, after posting his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) letter, the whole scene out; and it was a scene
during which, coming and going, as befell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eye not least
upon the daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fine sense of the conviction Mrs. Pocock
would take occasion to reaffirm--a conviction bearing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had from
the first deeply divined it to bear, on Mr. Strether's essential
inaptitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) conscious eyes even before he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
sailed, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) didn't believe HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would find the woman had been
written in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) book. Hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at the best but a scant faith in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ability to find women? It wasn't even as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
mother--so much more, to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) discrimination, had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother performed
the finding. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother had, in a case her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) private judgement of which
remained educative of Mrs. Pocock's critical sense, found the man. The
man owed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unchallenged state, in general, to the fact that Mrs.
Newsome's discoveries were accepted at Woollett; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
bones, our friend did, how almost irresistibly Mrs. Pocock would now be
moved to show what she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. Give HER a free hand, would
be the moral, and the woman would soon be found.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impression of Miss Gostrey after her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) introduction to Chad was
meanwhile an impression of a person almost unnaturally on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) guard. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
struck himself as at first unable to extract from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) wished;
though indeed OF what he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) wished at this special juncture he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) would
doubtless have contrived to make but a crude statement. It sifted and
settled nothing to put to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), tout betement, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) often said, <div class="bookquote">``Do
you like him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), eh?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) feeling it actually the least of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
needs to heap up the evidence in the young man's favour. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) repeatedly
knocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) door to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) have it afresh that Chad's
case--whatever else of minor interest it might yield--was first and
foremost a miracle almost monstrous. It was the alteration of the
entire man, and was so signal an instance that nothing else, for the
intelligent observer, could--COULD it?--signify. <div class="bookquote">``It's a plot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
declared--<div class="bookquote">``there's more in it than meets the eye.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave the rein to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancy. <div class="bookquote">``It's a plant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancy seemed to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Whose then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the party responsible is, I suppose, the fate that waits for
one, the dark doom that rides. What I mean is that with such elements
one can't count. I've but my poor individual, my modest human means.
It isn't playing the game to turn on the uncanny. All one's energy
goes to facing it, to tracking it. One wants, confound it, don't you
see?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confessed with a queer face--<div class="bookquote">``one wants to enjoy anything so
rare. Call it then life'' (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) puzzled it out--<div class="bookquote">``call it poor dear old
life simply that springs the surprise. Nothing alters the fact that the
surprise is paralysing, or at any rate engrossing--all, practically,
hang it, that one sees, that one CAN see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) silences were never barren, nor even dull. <div class="bookquote">``Is that what you've
written home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tossed it off. <div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had another pause while, across her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) carpets, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had another walk.
<div class="bookquote">``If you don't look out you'll have them straight over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but I've said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll go back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And WILL he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey asked.

<p/>The special tone of it made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), pulling up, look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) long. <div class="bookquote">``What's
that but just the question I've spent treasures of patience and
ingenuity in giving you, by the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--after everything had led
up--every facility to answer? What is it but just the thing I came
here to-day to get out of you? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s not free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The air of it held him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Then you've all the while known--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've known nothing but what I've seen; and I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) declared
with some impatience, <div class="bookquote">``that you didn't see as much. It was enough to be
with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) there--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the box? Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rather blankly urged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--to feel sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) chair, at this, with a nearer approach than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had
ever yet shown to dismay at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dimness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) even, fairly pausing for
it, spoke with a shade of pity. <div class="bookquote">``Guess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a shade, fairly, that brought a flush into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face; so that for
a moment, as they waited together, their difference was between them.
<div class="bookquote">``You mean that just your hour with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) told you so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) story?
Very good; I'm not such a fool, on my side, as that I don't understand
you, or as that I didn't in some degree understand HIM. That he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has
done what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) liked most isn't, among any of us, a matter the least in
dispute. There's equally little question at this time of day of what
it is he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does like most. But I'm not talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reasonably
explained, <div class="bookquote">``of any mere wretch he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) may still pick up. I'm talking of
some person who in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) present situation may have held her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own, may
really have counted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's exactly what I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Gostrey. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) as quickly made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) point. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you thought--or that they think at
Woollett--that that's what mere wretches necessarily do. Mere wretches
necessarily DON'T!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) declared with spirit. <div class="bookquote">``There must, behind
every appearance to the contrary, still be somebody--somebody who's not
a mere wretch, since we accept the miracle. What else but such a
somebody can such a miracle be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took it in. <div class="bookquote">``Because the fact itself IS the woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A woman. Some woman or other. It's one of the things that HAVE to
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you mean then at least a good one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) arms with a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I should call
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) excellent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why does he (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) deny her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey thought a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s too good to admit! Don't
you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) accounts for him (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether clearly, more and more, did see; yet it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) also see
other things. <div class="bookquote">``But isn't what we want that he (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) shall account for HER?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) does. What you have before you is his (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) way. You must forgive
him (<font color='blue'><b>somebody</b></font>) if it isn't quite outspoken. In Paris such debts are tacit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether could imagine; but still--! <div class="bookquote">``Even when the woman's good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) laughed out. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, and even when the man is! There's always
a caution in such cases,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) more seriously explained--<div class="bookquote">``for what it
may seem to show. There's nothing that's taken as showing so much here
as sudden unnatural goodness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then you're speaking now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said, <div class="bookquote">``of people who are NOT
nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I delight,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``in your classifications. But do you want
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``to give you in the matter, on this ground, the wisest
advice I'm capable of? Don't consider her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), don't judge her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at all in
herself. Consider her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and judge her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) only in Chad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had the courage at least of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's logic. <div class="bookquote">``Because then I
shall like her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost looked, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) quick imagination as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
already did, though seeing at once also the full extent of how little
it would suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) book. <div class="bookquote">``But is that what I came out for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had to confess indeed that it wasn't. But there was something
else. <div class="bookquote">``Don't make up your mind. There are all sorts of things. You
haven't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>This on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) side Strether recognised; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) acuteness none the less
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the danger. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, but if the more I see the better he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
seems?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) found something. <div class="bookquote">``That may be--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) disavowal of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
isn't, all the same, pure consideration. There's a hitch.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) made
it out. <div class="bookquote">``It's the effort to sink her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether winced at the image. <div class="bookquote">``To `sink'--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I mean there's a struggle, and a part of it is just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
hides. Take time--that's the only way not to make some mistake that
you'll regret. Then you'll see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) does really want to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Our friend had by this time so got into the vision that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost
gasped. <div class="bookquote">``After all she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a look which broke the next moment into a
wonderful smile. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s not so good as you think!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), these words, promising him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), in their character
of warning, considerable help; but the support he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) tried to draw from
them found itself on each renewal of contact with Chad defeated by
something else. What could it be, this disconcerting force, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) asked
himself, but the sense, constantly renewed, that Chad WAS--quite in
fact insisted on being--as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thought? It seemed somehow as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) couldn't BUT be as good from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wasn't as bad. There was
a succession of days at all events when contact with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)--and in its
immediate effect, as if it could produce no other--elbowed out of
Strether's consciousness everything but itself. Little Bilham once
more pervaded the scene, but little Bilham became even in a higher
degree than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had originally been one of the numerous forms of the
inclusive relation; a consequence promoted, to our friend's sense, by
two or three incidents with which we have yet to make acquaintance.
Waymarsh himself, for the occasion, was drawn into the eddy; it
absolutely, though but temporarily, swallowed him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) down, and there were
days when Strether seemed to bump against him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as a sinking swimmer
might brush a submarine object. The fathomless medium held
them--Chad's manner was the fathomless medium; and our friend felt as
if they passed each other, in their deep immersion, with the round
impersonal eye of silent fish. It was practically produced between
them that Waymarsh was giving him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) then his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) chance; and the shade of
discomfort that Strether drew from the allowance resembled not a little
the embarrassment he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had known at school, as a boy, when members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
family had been present at exhibitions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could perform before
strangers, but relatives were fatal, and it was now as if,
comparatively, Waymarsh were a relative. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) say
<div class="bookquote">``Strike up then!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and to enjoy a foretaste of conscientious domestic
criticism. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) HAD struck up, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) actually could; Chad knew by
this time in profusion what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wanted; and what vulgar violence did his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
fellow pilgrim expect of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had really emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mind? It
went somehow to and fro that what poor Waymarsh meant was <div class="bookquote">``I told you
so--that you'd lose your immortal soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>but it was also fairly
explicit that Strether had his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own challenge and that, since they must
go to the bottom of things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wasted no more virtue in watching Chad
than Chad wasted in watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) dip for duty's sake--where was
it worse than Waymarsh's own? For HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) needn't have stopped resisting
and refusing, needn't have parleyed, at that rate, with the foe.

<p/>The strolls over Paris to see something or call somewhere were
accordingly inevitable and natural, and the late sessions in the
wondrous troisieme, the lovely home, when men dropped in and the
picture composed more suggestively through the haze of tobacco, of
music more or less good and of talk more or less polyglot, were on a
principle not to be distinguished from that of the mornings and the
afternoons. Nothing, Strether had to recognise as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) leaned back and
smoked, could well less resemble a scene of violence than even the
liveliest of these occasions. They were occasions of discussion, none
the less, and Strether had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) life heard so many opinions on
so many subjects. There were opinions at Woollett, but only on three
or four. The differences were there to match; if they were doubtless
deep, though few, they were quiet--they were, as might be said, almost
as shy as if people had been ashamed of them. People showed little
diffidence about such things, on the other hand, in the Boulevard
Malesherbes, and were so far from being ashamed of them--or indeed of
anything else--that they often seemed to have invented them to avert
those agreements that destroy the taste of talk. No one had ever done
that at Woollett, though Strether could remember times when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself
had been tempted to it without quite knowing why. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw why at
present--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had but wanted to promote intercourse.

<p/>These, however, were but parenthetic memories, and the turn taken by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) affair on the whole was positively that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nerves were on the
stretch it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) missed violence. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked himself if
none would then, in connexion with it, ever come at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might
almost have passed as wondering how to provoke it. It would be too
absurd if such a vision as THAT should have to be invoked for relief;
it was already marked enough as absurd that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should actually have
begun with flutters and dignities on the score of a single accepted
meal. What sort of a brute had he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) expected Chad to be,
anyway?--Strether had occasion to make the enquiry but was careful to
make it in private. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could himself, comparatively recent as it
was--it was truly but the fact of a few days since--focus his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) primal
crudity; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would on the approach of an observer, as if handling an
illicit possession, have slipped the reminiscence out of sight. There
were echoes of it still in Mrs. Newsome's letters, and there were
moments when these echoes made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) exclaim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) want of tact. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
blushed of course, at once, still more for the explanation than for the
ground of it: it came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in time to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) manners that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
couldn't at the best become tactful as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) tact had to
reckon with the Atlantic Ocean, the General Post-Office and the
extravagant curve of the globe. Chad had one day offered tea at the
Boulevard Malesherbes to a chosen few, a group again including the
unobscured Miss Barrace; and Strether had on coming out walked away
with the acquaintance whom in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) letters to Mrs. Newsome he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) always
spoke of as the little artist-man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had had full occasion to mention
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as the other party, so oddly, to the only close personal alliance
observation had as yet detected in Chad's existence. Little Bilham's
way this afternoon was not Strether's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had none the less kindly
come with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and it was somehow a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) kindness that as it had
sadly begun to rain they suddenly found themselves seated for
conversation at a cafe in which they had taken refuge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had passed
no more crowded hour in Chad's society than the one just ended; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
talked with Miss Barrace, who had reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) with not having come
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had above all hit on a happy thought for causing
Waymarsh's tension to relax. Something might possibly be extracted for
the latter from the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) success with that lady, whose quick
apprehension of what might amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had given Strether a free hand.
What had she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) meant if not to ask whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) couldn't help him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
splendid encumbrance, and mightn't the sacred rage at any rate be kept
a little in abeyance by thus creating for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comrade's mind even in a
world of irrelevance the possibility of a relation? What was it but a
relation to be regarded as so decorative and, in especial, on the
strength of it, to be whirled away, amid flounces and feathers, in a
coupe lined, by what Strether could make out, with dark blue brocade?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself had never been whirled away--never at least in a coupe and
behind a footman; he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) had driven with Miss Gostrey in cabs, with Mrs.
Pocock, a few times, in an open buggy, with Mrs. Newsome in a
four-seated cart and, occasionally up at the mountains, on a buckboard;
but his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) friend's actual adventure transcended his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) personal experience.
He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) now showed his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) companion soon enough indeed how inadequate, as a
general monitor, this last queer quantity could once more feel itself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What game under the sun is he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) playing?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) signified the next moment
that his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) allusion was not to the fat gentleman immersed in dominoes on
whom his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) eyes had begun by resting, but to their host of the previous
hour, as to whom, there on the velvet bench, with a final collapse of
all consistency, he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) treated himself to the comfort of indiscretion.
<div class="bookquote">``Where do you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) come out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Little Bilham/Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham, in meditation, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) with a kindness almost
paternal. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you like it over here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether laughed out--for the tone was indeed droll; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) let himself go.
<div class="bookquote">``What has that to do with it? The only thing I've any business to like
is to feel that I'm moving him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). That's why I ask you whether you
believe I AM? Is the creature'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) best to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
simply wished to ascertain--<div class="bookquote">``honest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion looked responsible, but looked it through a small dim
smile. <div class="bookquote">``What creature do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was on this that they did have for a little a mute interchange. <div class="bookquote">``Is
it untrue that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s free? How then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked wondering <div class="bookquote">``does he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the creature you mean Chad himself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham said.

<p/>Strether here, with a rising hope, just thought, <div class="bookquote">``We must take one of
them at a time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) coherence lapsed. <div class="bookquote">``IS there some woman? Of
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s really afraid of course I mean--or who does with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's awfully charming of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>Bilham presently remarked, <div class="bookquote">``not to have

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I'm not fit for my job!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>The exclamation had escaped our friend, but it made little Bilham more
deliberate. <div class="bookquote">``Chad's a rare case!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) luminously observed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s
awfully changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you see it too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The way he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has improved? Oh yes--I think every one must see it. But
I'm not sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>said little Bilham, <div class="bookquote">``that I didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) about as
well in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) other state.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then this IS really a new state altogether?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man after a moment returned, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was
really meant by nature to be quite so good. It's like the new edition
of an old book that one has been fond of--revised and amended, brought
up to date, but not quite the thing one knew and loved. However that
may be at all events,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think, you know, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s
really playing, as you call it, any game. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) really wants to
go back and take up a career. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s capable of one, you know, that will
improve and enlarge him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) still more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) won't then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>little Bilham
continued to remark, <div class="bookquote">``be my pleasant well-rubbed old-fashioned volume
at all. But of course I'm beastly immoral. I'm afraid it would be a
funny world altogether--a world with things the way I like them. I
ought, I dare say, to go home and go into business myself. Only I'd
simply rather die--simply. And I've not the least difficulty in making
up my mind not to, and in knowing exactly why, and in defending my
ground against all comers. All the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``I assure you I
don't say a word against it--for himself, I mean--to Chad. I seem to
see it as much the best thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). You see he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s not happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``DO I?'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether stared. <div class="bookquote">``I've been supposing I see just the
opposite--an extraordinary case of the equilibrium arrived at and
assured.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh there's a lot behind it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah there you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``That's just what I want to
get at. You speak of your familiar volume altered out of recognition.
Well, who's the editor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham looked before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) a minute in silence. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) ought to get
married. THAT would do it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) wants to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wants to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Again little Bilham waited, and, with a sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had information,
Strether scarce knew what was coming. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) wants to be free. He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) isn't
used, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man explained in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lucid way, <div class="bookquote">``to being so
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Then I may take it from you that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) IS good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion matched his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pause, but making it up with a quiet fulness.
<div class="bookquote">``DO take it from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then why isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) free? He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) swears to me he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) is, but meanwhile
does nothing--except of course that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>)'s so kind to me--to prove it;
and couldn't really act much otherwise if he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) weren't. My question to
you just now was exactly on this queer impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) diplomacy: as
if instead of really giving ground his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) line were to keep me on here and
set me a bad example.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>As the half-hour meanwhile had ebbed Strether paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) score, and the
waiter was presently in the act of counting out change. Our friend
pushed back to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a fraction of it, with which, after an emphatic
recognition, the personage in question retreated. <div class="bookquote">``You give too much,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham permitted himself benevolently to observe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I always give too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether helplessly sighed. <div class="bookquote">``But you
don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on as if to get quickly away from the contemplation of
that doom, <div class="bookquote">``answer my question. Why isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) free?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham had got up as if the transaction with the waiter had been
a signal, and had already edged out between the table and the divan.
The effect of this was that a minute later they had quitted the place,
the gratified waiter alert again at the open door. Strether had found
himself deferring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's abruptness as to a hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
should be answered as soon as they were more isolated. This happened
when after a few steps in the outer air they had turned the next comer.
There our friend had kept it up. <div class="bookquote">``Why isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) free if he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>)'s good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) full in the face. <div class="bookquote">``Because it's a virtuous
attachment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>This had settled the question so effectually for the time--that is for
the next few days--that it had given Strether almost a new lease of
life. It must be added however that, thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) constant habit of
shaking the bottle in which life handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the wine of experience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
presently found the taste of the lees rising as usual into his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) draught.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) imagination had in other words already dealt with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) young
friend's assertion; of which it had made something that sufficiently
came out on the very next occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seeing Maria Gostrey. This
occasion moreover had been determined promptly by a new circumstance--a
circumstance he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was the last man to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) for a day in ignorance
of. <div class="bookquote">``When I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) immediately began, <div class="bookquote">``that
without some definite word from him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) now that will enable me to speak to
them over there of our sailing--or at least of mine, giving them some
sort of date--my responsibility becomes uncomfortable and my situation
awkward; when I said that to him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) what do you think was his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) reply?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) this time gave it up: <div class="bookquote">``Why that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) has two particular
friends, two ladies, mother and daughter, about to arrive in
Paris--coming back from an absence; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) wants me so furiously
to meet them, know them and like them, that I shall oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) by
kindly not bringing our business to a crisis till he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) has had a chance
to see them again himself. Is that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Strether enquired, <div class="bookquote">``the way he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>)'s
going to try to get off? These are the people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>)
must have gone down to see before I arrived. They're the best friends
he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) has in the world, and they take more interest than any one else in
what concerns him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>). As I'm his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) next best he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) sees a thousand reasons why
we should comfortably meet. He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) hasn't broached the question sooner
because their return was uncertain--seemed in fact for the present
impossible. But he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) more than intimates that--if you can believe
it--their desire to make my acquaintance has had to do with their
surmounting difficulties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're dying to see you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dying. Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``they're the virtuous attachment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had already told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) about that--had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) the day after his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) talk
with little Bilham; and they had then threshed out together the bearing
of the revelation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to put into it the logic in
which little Bilham had left it slightly deficient Strether hadn't
pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as to the object of the preference so unexpectedly
described; feeling in the presence of it, with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) irrepressible
scruples, a delicacy from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had in the quest of the quite other
article worked himself sufficiently free. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had held off, as on a
small principle of pride, from permitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) young friend to mention a
name; wishing to make with this the great point that Chad's virtuous
attachments were none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had wanted from the first
not to think too much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) dignity, but that was no reason for not
allowing it any little benefit that might turn up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had often enough
wondered to what degree his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) interference might pass for interested; so
that there was no want of luxury in letting it be seen whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
could that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't interfere. That had of course at the same time
not deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) of the further luxury of much private astonishment;
which however he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had reduced to some order before communicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
knowledge. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had done this at last it was with the remark that,
surprised as Miss Gostrey might, like himself, at first be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) would
probably agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) on reflexion that such an account of the matter
did after all fit the confirmed appearances. Nothing certainly, on all
the indications, could have been a greater change for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) than a
virtuous attachment, and since they had been in search of the <div class="bookquote">``word''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as
the French called it, of that change, little Bilham's
announcement--though so long and so oddly delayed--would serve as well
as another. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had assured Strether in fact after a pause that the
more she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) thought of it the more it did serve; and yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) assurance
hadn't so weighed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as that before they parted he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't
ventured to challenge her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) sincerity. Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) believe the attachment
was virtuous?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had made sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) again with the aid of that
question. The tidings he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) on this second occasion were
moreover such as would help him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to make surer still.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) showed at first none the less as only amused. <div class="bookquote">``You say there are
two? An attachment to them both then would, I suppose, almost
necessarily be innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Our friend took the point, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) clue. <div class="bookquote">``Mayn't he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) be still in
the stage of not quite knowing which of them, mother or daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
likes best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) gave it more thought. <div class="bookquote">``Oh it must be the daughter--at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly. Yet what do we know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked, <div class="bookquote">``about hers? She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) may
be old enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old enough for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why to marry Chad. That may be, you know, what they want. And if
Chad wants it too, and little Bilham wants it, and even we, at a pinch,
could do with it--that is if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) doesn't prevent repatriation--why it
may be plain sailing yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was always the case for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in these counsels that each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
remarks, as it came, seemed to drop into a deeper well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had at all
events to wait a moment to hear the slight splash of this one. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
see why if Mr. Newsome wants to marry the young lady he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hasn't already
done it or hasn't been prepared with some statement to you about it.
And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) both wants to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and is on good terms with them why
isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) `free'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, responsively, wondered indeed. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the girl herself
doesn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) speak of them to you as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) does?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's mind echoed the question, but also again met it. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps
it's with the mother he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s on good terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As against the daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s trying to persuade the daughter to consent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), what
could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) like the mother more? Only,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether threw out, <div class="bookquote">``why
shouldn't the daughter consent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>said Miss Gostrey, <div class="bookquote">``mayn't it be that every one else isn't quite
so struck with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) as you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) you mean as such an `eligible' young man? Is that
what I've come to?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) audibly and rather gravely sought to know.
<div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage is what his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother most
desires--that is if it will help. And oughtn't ANY marriage to help?
They must want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had already worked it out--<div class="bookquote">``to be better off.
Almost any girl he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may marry will have a direct interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taking
up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chances. It won't suit HER at least that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall miss them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey cast about. <div class="bookquote">``No--you reason well! But of course on the
other hand there's always dear old Woollett itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mused--<div class="bookquote">``there's always dear old Woollett itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) waited a moment. <div class="bookquote">``The young lady mayn't find herself able to
swallow THAT quantity. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may think it's paying too much; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may
weigh one thing against another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, ever restless in such debates, took a vague turn <div class="bookquote">``It will all
depend on who she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is. That of course--the proved ability to deal with
dear old Woollett, since I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does deal with it--is what makes
so strongly for Mamie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stopped short, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) tone, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>); then, though seeing that it
represented not vagueness, but a momentary embarrassed fulness, let his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
exclamation come. <div class="bookquote">``You surely haven't forgotten about Mamie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I haven't forgotten about Mamie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``There's no doubt
whatever that there's ever so much to be said for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>). Mamie's MY
girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) roundly declared.

<p/>Strether resumed for a minute his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) walk. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)'s really perfectly
lovely, you know. Far prettier than any girl I've seen over here yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's precisely on what I perhaps most build.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) mused a
moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) friend's way. <div class="bookquote">``I should positively like to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in
hand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) humoured the fancy, though indeed finally to deprecate it. <div class="bookquote">``Oh but
don't, in your zeal, go over to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)! I need you most and can't, you
know, be left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kept it up. <div class="bookquote">``I wish they'd send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If they knew you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``they would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but don't they?--after all that, as I've understood you you've told
them about me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had paused before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) course <div class="bookquote">``They
WILL--before, as you say, I've done.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came out with the point
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had wished after all most to make. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to give away now his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
game. This is what he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been doing--keeping me along for. He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has
been waiting for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey drew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``You see a good deal in it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt if I see as much as you. Do you pretend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that
you don't see--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why that there must be a lot between them--and that it has been going
on from the first; even from before I came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) took a minute to answer. <div class="bookquote">``Who are they then--if it's so grave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It mayn't be grave--it may be gay. But at any rate it's marked. Only
I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether had to confess, <div class="bookquote">``anything about them. Their
name for instance was a thing that, after little Bilham's information,
I found it a kind of refreshment not to feel obliged to follow up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``if you think you've got off--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) laugh produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a momentary gloom. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I've got
off. I only think I'm breathing for about five minutes. I dare say I
SHALL have, at the best, still to get on.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A look, over it all, passed
between them, and the next minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had come back to good humour. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't meanwhile take the smallest interest in their name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor in their nationality?--American, French, English, Polish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care the least little `hang,'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``for their
nationality. It would be nice if they're Polish!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost
immediately added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very nice indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>The transition kept up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) spirits. <div class="bookquote">``So you see
you do care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) did this contention a modified justice. <div class="bookquote">``I think I should if they
WERE Polish. Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thought--<div class="bookquote">``there might be joy in THAT.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us then hope for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) came after this nearer to the
question. ``If the girl's of the right age of course the mother can't
be. I mean for the virtuous attachment. If the girl's twenty--and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
can't be less--the mother must be at least forty. So it puts the mother
out. SHE<div class="bookquote">``S too old for him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, arrested again, considered and demurred. ``Do you think so?
Do you think any one would be too old for him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? I``M eighty, and I'm too
young. But perhaps the girl,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``ISn't twenty. Perhaps
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s only ten--but such a little dear that Chad finds himself counting
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in as an attraction of the acquaintance. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s only five.
Perhaps the mother's but five-and-twenty--a charming young widow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey entertained the suggestion. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) IS a widow then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They once more, in spite of this
vagueness, exchanged a look--a look that was perhaps the longest yet.
It seemed in fact, the next thing, to require to explain itself; which
it did as it could. <div class="bookquote">``I only feel what I've told you--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has some
reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey's imagination had taken its own flight. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'s
NOT a widow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether seemed to accept the possibility with reserve. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
accepted it. <div class="bookquote">``Then that's why the attachment--if it's to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)--is
virtuous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) scarce followed. <div class="bookquote">``Why is it virtuous
if--since she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'s free--there's nothing to impose on it any condition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I perhaps don't mean as virtuous as
THAT! Your idea is that it can be virtuous--in any sense worthy of the
name--only if she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'s NOT free? But what does it become then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked,
<div class="bookquote">``for HER?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah that's another matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said nothing for a moment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) soon
went on. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say you're right, at any rate, about Mr. Newsome's
little plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) HAS been trying you--has been reporting on you to
these friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether meanwhile had had time to think more. <div class="bookquote">``Then where's his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
straightness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as we say, it's struggling up, breaking out, asserting itself as
it can. We can be on the side, you see, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) straightness. We can
help him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) has made out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>said Miss Gostrey, <div class="bookquote">``that you'll do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, for THEM--for ces dames. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) has watched you, studied you, liked
you--and recognised that THEY must. It's a great compliment to you, my
dear man; for I'm sure they're particular. You came out for a success.
Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) gaily declared, <div class="bookquote">``you're having it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) with momentary patience and then turned abruptly
away. It was always convenient to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that there were so many fine
things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) room to look at. But the examination of two or three of
them appeared soon to have determined a speech that had little to do
with them. <div class="bookquote">``You don't believe in it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the character of the attachment. In its innocence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) defended herself. <div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to know anything about it.
Everything's possible. We must see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) echoed with a groan. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't we seen enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you suppose then little Bilham has lied?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must find out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost turn pale. <div class="bookquote">``Find out any MORE?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had dropped on a sofa for dismay; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) seemed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) stood over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), to have the last word. <div class="bookquote">``Wasn't what you came out for to find out
ALL?''





 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Book Fifth




<p/>I


<p/>The Sunday of the next week was a wonderful day, and Chad Newsome had
let his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) friend know in advance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had provided for it. There had
already been a question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) to see the great Gloriani,
who was at home on Sunday afternoons and at whose house, for the most
part, fewer bores were to be met than elsewhere; but the project,
through some accident, had not had instant effect, and now revived in
happier conditions. Chad had made the point that the celebrated
sculptor had a queer old garden, for which the weather--spring at last
frank and fair--was propitious; and two or three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) other allusions
had confirmed for Strether the expectation of something special. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had by this time, for all introductions and adventures, let himself
recklessly go, cherishing the sense that whatever the young man showed
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was showing at least himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have wished indeed, so
far as this went, that Chad were less of a mere cicerone; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was
not without the impression--now that the vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) game, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) plan,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) deep diplomacy, did recurrently assert itself--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) taking refuge
from the realities of their intercourse in profusely dispensing, as our
friend mentally phrased et panem et circenses. Our friend continued to
feel rather smothered in flowers, though he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) other moments
the almost angry inference that this was only because of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) odious
ascetic suspicion of any form of beauty. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) periodically assured
himself--for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reactions were sharp--that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shouldn't reach the
truth of anything till he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had at least got rid of that.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had known beforehand that Madame de Vionnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) daughter would
probably be on view, an intimation to that effect having constituted
the only reference again made by Chad to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) good friends from the
south. The effect of Strether's talk about them with Miss Gostrey had
been quite to consecrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) reluctance to pry; something in the very
air of Chad's silence--judged in the light of that talk--offered it to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as a reserve he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could markedly match. It shrouded them about with
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) scarce knew what, a consideration, a distinction; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was in presence
at any rate--so far as it placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) there--of ladies; and the one
thing that was definite for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was that they themselves should be, to
the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) responsibility, in presence of a gentleman. Was it
because they were very beautiful, very clever, or even very good--was
it for one of these reasons that Chad was, so to speak, nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
effect? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wish to spring them, in the Woollett phrase, with a
fuller force--to confound his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) critic, slight though as yet the
criticism, with some form of merit exquisitely incalculable? The most
the critic had at all events asked was whether the persons in question
were French; and that enquiry had been but a proper comment on the
sound of their name. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. That is no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>had been Chad's reply; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had immediately added that their English was the most charming in the
world, so that if Strether were wanting an excuse for not getting on
with them he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't in the least find one. Never in fact had
Strether--in the mood into which the place had quickly launched
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--felt, for himself, less the need of an excuse. Those he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might
have found would have been, at the worst, all for the others, the
people before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), in whose liberty to be as they were he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was aware
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) positively rejoiced. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fellow guests were multiplying, and
these things, their liberty, their intensity, their variety, their
conditions at large, were in fusion in the admirable medium of the
scene.

<p/>The place itself was a great impression--a small pavilion, clear-faced
and sequestered, an effect of polished parquet, of fine white panel and
spare sallow gilt, of decoration delicate and rare, in the heart of the
Faubourg Saint-Germain and on the edge of a cluster of gardens attached
to old noble houses. Far back from streets and unsuspected by crowds,
reached by a long passage and a quiet court, it was as striking to the
unprepared mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) immediately saw, as a treasure dug up; giving him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>)
too, more than anything yet, the note of the range of the immeasurable
town and sweeping away, as by a last brave brush, his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) usual landmarks
and terms. It was in the garden, a spacious cherished remnant, out of
which a dozen persons had already passed, that Chad's host presently
met them while the tall bird-haunted trees, all of a twitter with the
spring and the weather, and the high party-walls, on the other side of
which grave hotels stood off for privacy, spoke of survival,
transmission, association, a strong indifferent persistent order. The
day was so soft that the little party had practically adjourned to the
open air but the open air was in such conditions all a chamber of
state. Strether had presently the sense of a great convent, a convent
of missions, famous for he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) scarce knew what, a nursery of young
priests, of scattered shade, of straight alleys and chapel-bells, that
spread its mass in one quarter; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had the sense of names in the air,
of ghosts at the windows, of signs and tokens, a whole range of
expression, all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), too thick for prompt discrimination.

<p/>This assault of images became for a moment, in the address of the
distinguished sculptor, almost formidable: Gloriani showed him (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>), in
such perfect confidence, on Chad's introduction of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), a fine worn
handsome face, a face that was like an open letter in a foreign tongue.
With his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) genius in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) manners on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) lips, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) long career
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) honours and rewards all round, the great artist, in
the course of a single sustained look and a few words of delight at
receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), affected our friend as a dazzling prodigy of type.
Strether had seen in museums--in the Luxembourg as well as, more
reverently, later on, in the New York of the billionaires--the work of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand; knowing too that after an earlier time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) native Rome he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had migrated, in mid-career, to Paris, where, with a personal lustre
almost violent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shone in a constellation: all of which was more
than enough to crown him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) guest, with the light, with the
romance, of glory. Strether, in contact with that element as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
never yet so intimately been, had the consciousness of opening to it,
for the happy instant, all the windows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mind, of letting this
rather grey interior drink in for once the sun of a clime not marked in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) old geography. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to remember again repeatedly the medal-like
Italian face, in which every line was an artist's own, in which time
told only as tone and consecration; and he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was to recall in especial,
as the penetrating radiance, as the communication of the illustrious
spirit itself, the manner in which, while they stood briefly, in
welcome and response, face to face, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was held by the sculptor's eyes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) wasn't soon to forget them, was to think of them, all unconscious,
unintending, preoccupied though they were, as the source of the deepest
intellectual sounding to which he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had ever been exposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was in
fact quite to cherish his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) vision of it, to play with it in idle hours;
only speaking of it to no one and quite aware he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) couldn't have spoken
without appearing to talk nonsense. Was what it had told him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) or what
it had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) the greater of the mysteries? Was it the most special
flare, unequalled, supreme, of the aesthetic torch, lighting that
wondrous world for ever, or was it above all the long straight shaft
sunk by a personal acuteness that life had seasoned to steel? Nothing
on earth could have been stranger and no one doubtless more surprised
than the artist himself, but it was for all the world to Strether just
then as if in the matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) accepted duty he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had positively been on
trial. The deep human expertness in Gloriani's charming smile--oh the
terrible life behind it!--was flashed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as a test of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stuff.

<p/>Chad meanwhile, after having easily named his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion, had still more
easily turned away and was already greeting other persons present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
was as easy, clever Chad, with the great artist as with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) obscure
compatriot, and as easy with every one else as with either: this fell
into its place for Strether and made almost a new light, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), as
a concatenation, something more he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could enjoy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) liked Gloriani, but
should never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) again; of that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was sufficiently sure. Chad
accordingly, who was wonderful with both of them, was a kind of link
for hopeless fancy, an implication of possibilities--oh if everything
had been different! Strether noted at all events that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was thus on
terms with illustrious spirits, and also that--yes, distinctly--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
hadn't in the least swaggered about it. Our friend hadn't come there
only for this figure of Abel Newsome's son, but that presence
threatened to affect the observant mind as positively central. Gloriani
indeed, remembering something and excusing himself, pursued Chad to
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and Strether was left musing on many things. One of them
was the question of whether, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been tested, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had passed.
Did the artist drop him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) from having made out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
really felt just to-day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might do better than usual. Hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
done well enough, so far as that went, in being exactly so dazzled? and
in not having too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost believed, wholly hidden from his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) host
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt the latter's plummet? Suddenly, across the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw
little Bilham approach, and it was a part of the fit that was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
that as their eyes met he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) guessed also HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knowledge. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had said to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) on the instant what was uppermost he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have said: <div class="bookquote">``HAVE I
passed?--for of course I know one has to pass here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Little Bilham
would have reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>), have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) exaggerated, and have
adduced happily enough the argument of little Bilham's own very
presence; which, in truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) could see, was as easy a one as
Gloriani's own or as Chad's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) himself would perhaps then after a
while cease to be frightened, would get the point of view for some of
the faces--types tremendously alien, alien to Woollett--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
already begun to take in. Who were they all, the dispersed groups and
couples, the ladies even more unlike those of Woollett than the
gentlemen?--this was the enquiry that, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) young friend had
greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) did find himself making.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh they're every one--all sorts and sizes; of course I mean within
limits, though limits down perhaps rather more than limits up. There
are always artists--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'s beautiful and inimitable to the cher confrere;
and then gros bonnets of many kinds--ambassadors, cabinet ministers,
bankers, generals, what do I know? even Jews. Above all always some
awfully nice women--and not too many; sometimes an actress, an artist,
a great performer--but only when they're not monsters; and in
particular the right femmes du monde. You can fancy his (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) history on that
side--I believe it's fabulous: they NEVER give him (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) up. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) keeps
them down: no one knows how he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) manages; it's too beautiful and bland.
Never too many--and a mighty good thing too; just a perfect choice. But
there are not in any way many bores; it has always been so; he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) has some
secret. It's extraordinary. And you don't find it out. He (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>)'s the same
to every one. He (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) doesn't ask questions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed.

<p/>Bilham met it with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) candour. ``How then should I be here?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh for what you tell me. You're part of the perfect choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, the young man took in the scene. <div class="bookquote">``It seems rather good to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether followed the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Are they all, this time,
femmes du monde?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) competence. <div class="bookquote">``Pretty well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a category our friend had a feeling for; a light, romantic and
mysterious, on the feminine element, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) enjoyed for a little
watching it. <div class="bookquote">``Are there any Poles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companion considered. ``I think I make out a ``Portuguee.<div class="bookquote">'' But I've
seen Turks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered, desiring justice. <div class="bookquote">``They seem--all the women--very
harmonious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh in closer quarters they come out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And then, while Strether was
aware of fearing closer quarters, though giving himself again to the
harmonies, <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>little Bilham went on, <div class="bookquote">``it IS at the worst rather
good, you know. If you like it, you feel it, this way, that shows
you're not in the least out But you always know things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) handsomely
added, <div class="bookquote">``immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether liked it and felt it only too much; so <div class="bookquote">``I say, don't lay traps
for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) rather helplessly murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion returned, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s wonderfully kind to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To us Americans you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) doesn't know anything about THAT. That's half the battle
here--that you can never hear politics. We don't talk them. I mean to
poor young wretches of all sorts. And yet it's always as charming as
this; it's as if, by something in the air, our squalor didn't show. It
puts us all back--into the last century.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said, amused, <div class="bookquote">``that it puts me rather forward:
oh ever so far!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Into the next? But isn't that only,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham asked, <div class="bookquote">``because
you're really of the century before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The century before the last? Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed. <div class="bookquote">``If I ask
you about some of the ladies it can't be then that I may hope, as such
a specimen of the rococo, to please them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary they adore--we all adore here--the rococo, and where
is there a better setting for it than the whole thing, the pavilion and
the garden, together? There are lots of people with collections,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) glanced round. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be secured!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It made Strether for a moment give himself again to contemplation.
There were faces he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) scarce knew what to make of. Were they charming or
were they only strange? He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mightn't talk politics, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) suspected a
Pole or two. The upshot was the question at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head from
the moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend had joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Have Madame de Vionnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
daughter arrived?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I haven't seen them yet, but Miss Gostrey has come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)'s in the
pavilion looking at objects. One can see SHE<div class="bookquote">``S a collector,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>little
Bilham added without offence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)'s a collector, and I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was to come. Is Madame de
Vionnet a collector?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather, I believe; almost celebrated.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man met, on it, a
little, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend's eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I happen to know--from Chad, whom I saw
last night--that they've come back; but only yesterday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wasn't
sure--up to the last. This, accordingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham went on, <div class="bookquote">``will
be--if they ARE here--their first appearance after their return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, very quickly, turned these things over. <div class="bookquote">``Chad told you last
night? To me, on our way here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) said nothing about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But did you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether did him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the justice. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>said little Bilham, <div class="bookquote">``you're not a person to whom it's easy to
tell things you don't want to know. Though it is easy, I admit--it's
quite beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) benevolently added, <div class="bookquote">``when you do want to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with an indulgence that matched his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
intelligence. <div class="bookquote">``Is that the deep reasoning on which--about these
ladies--you've been yourself so silent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham considered the depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) reasoning. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't been
silent. I spoke of them to you the other day, the day we sat together
after Chad's tea-party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether came round to it. <div class="bookquote">``They then are the virtuous attachment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only tell you that it's what they pass for. But isn't that
enough? What more than a vain appearance does the wisest of us know? I
commend you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man declared with a pleasant emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``the
vain appearance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether looked more widely round, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw, from face to face,
deepened the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) young friend's words. <div class="bookquote">``Is it so good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Magnificent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had a pause. <div class="bookquote">``The husband's dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear no. Alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether. After which, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion laughed: <div class="bookquote">``How then
can it be so good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll see for yourself. One does see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chad's in love with the daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Then where's the difficulty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, aren't you and I--with our grander bolder ideas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh mine--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said rather strangely. But then as if to
attenuate: <div class="bookquote">``You mean they won't hear of Woollett?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't that just what you must see about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It had brought them, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) caught the last words, into relation with
Miss Barrace, whom Strether had already observed--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never
before seen a lady at a party--moving about alone. Coming within sound
of them she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had already spoken, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took again, through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
long-handled glass, all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) amused and amusing possession. <div class="bookquote">``How much,
poor Mr. Strether, you seem to have to see about! But you can't say,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gaily declared, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't do what I can to help you. Mr.
Waymarsh is placed. I've left him (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) in the house with Miss Gostrey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Strether gets the ladies to
work for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)'s just preparing to draw in another; to pounce--don't
you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)?--on Madame de Vionnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame de Vionnet? Oh, oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace cried in a wonderful
crescendo. There was more in it, our friend made out, than met the
ear. Was it after all a joke that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should be serious about anything?
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) envied Miss Barrace at any rate her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) power of not being. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed,
with little cries and protests and quick recognitions, movements like
the darts of some fine high-feathered free-pecking bird, to stand
before life as before some full shop-window. You could fairly hear, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) selected and pointed, the tap of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tortoise-shell against the
glass. <div class="bookquote">``It's certain that we do need seeing about; only I'm glad it's
not I who have to do it. One does, no doubt, begin that way; then
suddenly one finds that one has given it up. It's too much, it's too
difficult. You're wonderful, you people,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) continued to Strether,
<div class="bookquote">``for not feeling those things--by which I mean impossibilities. You
never feel them. You face them with a fortitude that makes it a lesson
to watch you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but'' (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>--little Bilham put it with discouragement--<div class="bookquote">``what do we achieve
after all? We see about you and report--when we even go so far as
reporting. But nothing's done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you, Mr. Bilham,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) replied as with an impatient rap on the
glass, <div class="bookquote">``you're not worth sixpence! You come over to convert the
savages--for I know you verily did, I remember you--and the savages
simply convert YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man woefully confessed: <div class="bookquote">``they haven't gone
through that form. They've simply--the cannibals!--eaten me; converted
me if you like, but converted me into food. I'm but the bleached bones
of a Christian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then there we are! Only'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barrace</b></font>)</div>--and Miss Barrace appealed again to
Strether--<div class="bookquote">``don't let it discourage you. You'll break down soon enough,
but you'll meanwhile have had your moments. Il faut en avoir. I
always like to see you while you last. And I'll tell you who WILL
last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Waymarsh?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) up.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) laughed out as at the alarm of it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)'ll resist even Miss
Gostrey: so grand is it not to understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)'s wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether conceded. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) wouldn't tell me of this
affair--only said he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had an engagement; but with such a gloom, you must
let me insist, as if it had been an engagement to be hanged. Then
silently and secretly he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) turns up here with you. Do you call THAT
`lasting'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I hope it's lasting!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barrace</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace said. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) only, at the
best, bears with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) doesn't understand--not one little scrap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)'s
delightful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)'s wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Michelangelesque!'' (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>--little Bilham completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) meaning. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) IS a
success. Moses, on the ceiling, brought down to the floor;
overwhelming, colossal, but somehow portable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, if you mean by portable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``looking so well in
one's carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)'s too funny beside me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) comer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) looks like
somebody, somebody foreign and famous, en exil; so that people
wonder--it's very amusing--whom I'm taking about. I show him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) Paris,
show him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) everything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) never turns a hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)'s like the Indian
chief one reads about, who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) comes up to Washington to see the
Great Father, stands wrapt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) blanket and gives no sign. I might
be the Great Father--from the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) takes everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) was
delighted at this hit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) identity with that personage--it fitted so
her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) character; she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) declared it was the title she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) meant henceforth to
adopt. <div class="bookquote">``And the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sits, too, in the corner of my room, only
looking at my visitors very hard and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) wanted to start
something! They wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) does want to start. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s
wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace once more insisted. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has never started
anything yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It presented him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) none the less, in truth, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) actual friends, who
looked at each other in intelligence, with frank amusement on Bilham's
part and a shade of sadness on Strether's. Strether's sadness
sprang--for the image had its grandeur--from his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thinking how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
himself was wrapt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) blanket, how little, in marble halls, all too
oblivious of the Great Father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) resembled a really majestic
aboriginal. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had also another reflexion. <div class="bookquote">``You've all of you here
so much visual sense that you've somehow all `run' to it. There are
moments when it strikes one that you haven't any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any moral,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham explained, watching serenely, across the
garden, the several femmes du monde. <div class="bookquote">``But Miss Barrace has a moral
distinction,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) kindly continued; speaking as if for Strether's
benefit not less than for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HAVE you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether, scarce knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was about, asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
almost eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh not a distinction'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was mightily amused at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) tone--<div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Bilham's too good. But I think I may say a sufficiency. Yes, a
sufficiency. Have you supposed strange things of me?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) fixed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) again, through all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) tortoise-shell, with the droll interest of
it. <div class="bookquote">``You ARE all indeed wonderful. I should awfully disappoint you. I
do take my stand on my sufficiency. But I know, I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) went
on, <div class="bookquote">``strange people. I don't know how it happens; I don't do it on
purpose; it seems to be my doom--as if I were always one of their
habits: it's wonderful! I dare say moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) pursued with an
interested gravity, <div class="bookquote">``that I do, that we all do here, run too much to
mere eye. But how can it be helped? We're all looking at each
other--and in the light of Paris one sees what things resemble. That's
what the light of Paris seems always to show. It's the fault of the
light of Paris--dear old light!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear old Paris!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything, every one shows,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But for what they really are?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I like your Boston `reallys'! But sometimes--yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear old Paris then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether resignedly sighed while for a moment
they looked at each other. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) broke out: <div class="bookquote">``Does Madame de Vionnet
do that? I mean really show for what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) answer was prompt. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s charming. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s perfect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then why did you a minute ago say ``Oh, oh, oh!<div class="bookquote">'' at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) easily remembered. <div class="bookquote">``Why just because--! She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) too?'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether had almost a groan.

<p/>But Miss Barrace had meanwhile perceived relief. <div class="bookquote">``Why not put your
question straight to the person who can answer it best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>said little Bilham; <div class="bookquote">``don't put any question; wait, rather--it
will be much more fun--to judge for yourself. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has come to take you
to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''



 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>II


<p/>On which Strether saw that Chad was again at hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) afterwards
scarce knew, absurd as it may seem, what had then quickly occurred. The
moment concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt, more deeply than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could have
explained, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had a subsequent passage of speculation as to
whether, on walking off with Chad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't looked either pale or red.
The only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was clear about was that, luckily, nothing indiscreet
had in fact been said and that Chad himself was more than ever, in Miss
Barrace's great sense, wonderful. It was one of the connexions--though
really why it should be, after all, was none so apparent--in which the
whole change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) came out as most striking. Strether recalled as
they approached the house that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that first night as
knowing how to enter a box. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) scarce less now as
knowing how to make a presentation. It did something for Strether's
own quality--marked it as estimated; so that our poor friend, conscious
and passive, really seemed to feel himself quite handed over and
delivered; absolutely, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would have said, made a present of, given
away. As they reached the house a young woman, about to come forth,
appeared, unaccompanied, on the steps; at the exchange with whom of a
word on Chad's part Strether immediately perceived that, obligingly,
kindly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was there to meet them. Chad had left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the house, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had afterwards come halfway and then the next moment had joined
them in the garden. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) air of youth, for Strether, was at first almost
disconcerting, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) second impression was, not less sharply, a
degree of relief at there not having just been, with the others, any
freedom used about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). It was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at a touch that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was no
subject for that, and meanwhile, on Chad's introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), very simply and gently, in an English clearly of the
easiest to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), yet unlike any other he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had ever heard. It wasn't as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried; nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could see after they had been a few minutes
together, was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried; but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) speech, charming correct and
odd, was like a precaution against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passing for a Pole. There were
precautions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) seemed indeed to see, only when there were really
dangers.

<p/>Later on he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was to feel many more of them, but by that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was to
feel other things besides. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dressed in black, but in black that
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as light and transparent; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was exceedingly fair, and,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was as markedly slim, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face had a roundness, with eyes
far apart and a little strange. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smile was natural and dim; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hat
not extravagant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had only perhaps a sense of the clink, beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
fine black sleeves, of more gold bracelets and bangles than he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had ever
seen a lady wear. Chad was excellently free and light about their
encounter; it was one of the occasions on which Strether most wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
himself might have arrived at such ease and such humour: <div class="bookquote">``Here you are
then, face to face at last; you're made for each other--vous allez
voir; and I bless your union.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was indeed, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had gone off,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been partly serious too. This latter motion had been
determined by an enquiry from him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) about <div class="bookquote">``Jeanne'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>; to which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother
had replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was probably still in the house with Miss Gostrey,
to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had lately committed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah but you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man
had rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>; with which, while Strether pricked up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ears, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had started as if to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), leaving the other objects
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interest together. Strether wondered to find Miss Gostrey
already involved, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) missed a link; but feeling also, with
small delay, how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should like to talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) of Madame de
Vionnet on this basis of evidence.

<p/>The evidence as yet in truth was meagre; which, for that matter, was
perhaps a little why his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) expectation had had a drop. There was somehow
not quite a wealth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>); and a wealth was all that, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
simplicity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had definitely prefigured. Still, it was too much to be
sure already that there was but a poverty. They moved away from the
house, and, with eyes on a bench at some distance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) proposed that
they should sit down. <div class="bookquote">``I've heard a great deal about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said as
they went; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had an answer to it that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) stop short. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
about YOU, Madame de Vionnet, I've heard, I'm bound to say, almost
nothing'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--those struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as the only words he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) himself could utter
with any lucidity; conscious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was, and as with more reason, of the
determination to be in respect to the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) business perfectly
plain and go perfectly straight. It hadn't at any rate been in the
least his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) idea to spy on Chad's proper freedom. It was possibly,
however, at this very instant and under the impression of Madame de
Vionnet's pause, that going straight began to announce itself as a
matter for care. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had only after all to smile at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) ever so gently
in order to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) ask himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) weren't already going crooked.
It might be going crooked to find it of a sudden just only clear that
she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) intended very definitely to be what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) would have called nice to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). This was what passed between them while, for another instant,
they stood still; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) couldn't at least remember afterwards what else it
might have been. The thing indeed really unmistakeable was its rolling
over him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as a wave that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had been, in conditions incalculable and
unimaginable, a subject of discussion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had been, on some ground
that concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), answered for; which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) an advantage he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) should
never be able to match.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't Miss Gostrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``said a good word for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>What had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) first was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was bracketed with that lady;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wondered what account Chad would have given of their
acquaintance. Something not as yet traceable, at all events, had
obviously happened. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't even know of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) knowing you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)'ll tell you all. I'm so glad you're in relation with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was one of the things--the <div class="bookquote">``all''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey would now tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)--that, with every deference to present preoccupation, was uppermost
for Strether after they had taken their seat. One of the others was,
at the end of five minutes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)--oh incontestably, yes--DIFFERED
less; differed, that is, scarcely at all--well, superficially speaking,
from Mrs. Newsome or even from Mrs. Pocock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was ever so much
younger than the one and not so young as the other; but what WAS there
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>), if anything, that would have made it impossible he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) at Woollett? And wherein was her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) talk during their moments on the
bench together not the same as would have been found adequate for a
Woollett garden-party?--unless perhaps truly in not being quite so
bright. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) observed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that Mr. Newsome had, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) knowledge,
taken extraordinary pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) visit; but there was no good lady
at Woollett who wouldn't have been at least up to that. Was there in
Chad, by chance, after all, deep down, a principle of aboriginal
loyalty that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), for sentimental ends, attach himself to
elements, happily encountered, that would remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) most of the old
air and the old soil? Why accordingly be in a flutter--Strether could
even put it that way--about this unfamiliar phenomenon of the femme du
monde? On these terms Mrs. Newsome herself was as much of one. Little
Bilham verily had testified that they came out, the ladies of the type,
in close quarters; but it was just in these quarters--now comparatively
close--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) felt Madame de Vionnet's common humanity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) did come
out, and certainly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) relief, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) came out as the usual thing.
There might be motives behind, but so could there often be even at
Woollett. The only thing was that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) wished to like
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)--as the motives behind might conceivably prompt--it would possibly
have been more thrilling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) should have shown as more
vividly alien. Ah she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was neither Turk nor Pole!--which would be
indeed flat once more for Mrs. Newsome and Mrs. Pocock. A lady and two
gentlemen had meanwhile, however, approached their bench, and this
accident stayed for the time further developments.

<p/>They presently addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) companion, the brilliant strangers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
rose to speak to them, and Strether noted how the escorted lady, though
mature and by no means beautiful, had more of the bold high look, the
range of expensive reference, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had, as might have been said,
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) plans for. Madame de Vionnet greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``Duchesse''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and
was greeted in turn, while talk started in French, as <div class="bookquote">``Ma toute-belle'' (<font color='red'><b>French</b></font>)</div>;
little facts that had their due, their vivid interest for Strether.
Madame de Vionnet didn't, none the less, introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)--a note he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was
conscious of as false to the Woollett scale and the Woollett humanity;
though it didn't prevent the Duchess, who struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as confident and
free, very much what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had obscurely supposed duchesses, from looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as straight and as hard--for it WAS hard--as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) would have
liked, all the same, to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, my dear, it's all right,
it's ME; and who are YOU, with your interesting wrinkles and your most
effective -LRB-is it the handsomest, is it the ugliest?-RRB- of noses?'' (<font color='red'><b>some handful</b></font>)</div>--some
such loose handful of bright flowers she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) seemed, fragrantly enough, to
fling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). Strether almost wondered--at such a pace was he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
going--if some divination of the influence of either party were what
determined Madame de Vionnet's abstention. One of the gentlemen, in
any case, succeeded in placing himself in close relation with our
friend's companion; a gentleman rather stout and importantly short, in
a hat with a wonderful wide curl to its brim and a frock coat buttoned
with an effect of superlative decision. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) French had quickly turned
to equal English, and it occurred to Strether that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might well be one
of the ambassadors. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) design was evidently to assert a claim to
Madame de Vionnet's undivided countenance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) made it good in the
course of a minute--led her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) away with a trick of three words; a trick
played with a social art of which Strether, looking after them as the
four, whose backs were now all turned, moved off, felt himself no
master.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sank again upon his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bench and, while his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes followed the party,
reflected, as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had done before, on Chad's strange communities. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
sat there alone for five minutes, with plenty to think of; above all
with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sense of having suddenly been dropped by a charming woman
overlaid now by other impressions and in fact quite cleared and
indifferent. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hadn't yet had so quiet a surrender; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) didn't in the
least care if nobody spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) more. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might have been, by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
attitude, in for something of a march so broad that the want of
ceremony with which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had just been used could fall into its place as
but a minor incident of the procession. Besides, there would be
incidents enough, as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) felt when this term of contemplation was closed
by the reappearance of little Bilham, who stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) a moment
with a suggestive <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) saw himself reflected as
disorganised, as possibly floored. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) replied with a <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>intended
to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) wasn't floored in the least. No indeed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) gave it
out, as the young man sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>), that if, at the worst, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
had been overturned at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had been overturned into the upper air,
the sublimer element with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had an affinity and in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
might be trusted a while to float. It wasn't a descent to earth to say
after an instant and in sustained response to the reference: <div class="bookquote">``You're
quite sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) husband's living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had after all to think. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm sorry for them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But it
didn't for the moment matter more than that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) assured his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) young
friend he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was quite content. They wouldn't stir; were all right as
they were. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't want to be introduced; had been introduced
already about as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had seen moreover an
immensity; liked Gloriani, who, as Miss Barrace kept saying, was
wonderful; had made out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was sure, the half-dozen other `men who
were distinguished, the artists, the critics and oh the great
dramatist--HIM it was easy to spot; but wanted--no, thanks, really--to
talk with none of them; having nothing at all to say and finding it
would do beautifully as it was; do beautifully because what it
was--well, was just simply too late. And when after this little Bilham,
submissive and responsive, but with an eye to the consolation nearest,
easily threw off some <div class="bookquote">``Better late than never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>all he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) got in return
for it was a sharp <div class="bookquote">``Better early than late!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This note indeed the next
thing overflowed for Strether into a quiet stream of demonstration that
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had let himself go he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt as the real relief. It had
consciously gathered to a head, but the reservoir had filled sooner
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's touch was to make the waters spread.
There were some things that had to come in time if they were to come at
all. If they didn't come in time they were lost for ever. It was the
general sense of them that had overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with its long slow rush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not too late for YOU, on any side, and you don't strike me as in
danger of missing the train; besides which people can be in general
pretty well trusted, of course--with the clock of their freedom ticking
as loud as it seems to do here--to keep an eye on the fleeting hour.
All the same don't forget that you're young--blessedly young; be glad
of it on the contrary and live up to it. Live all you can; it's a
mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter what you do in particular,
so long as you have your life. If you haven't had that what HAVE you
had? This place and these impressions--mild as you may find them to
wind a man up so; all my impressions of Chad and of people I've seen at
HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) place--well, have had their abundant message for me, have just
dropped THAT into my mind. I see it now. I haven't done so enough
before--and now I'm old; too old at any rate for what I see. Oh I DO
see, at least; and more than you'd believe or I can express. It's too
late. And it's as if the train had fairly waited at the station for me
without my having had the gumption to know it was there. Now I hear its
faint receding whistle miles and miles down the line. What one loses
one loses; make no mistake about that. The affair--I mean the affair
of life--couldn't, no doubt, have been different for me; for it's at
the best a tin mould, either fluted and embossed, with ornamental
excrescences, or else smooth and dreadfully plain, into which, a
helpless jelly, one's consciousness is poured--so that one `takes' the
form as the great cook says, and is more or less compactly held by it:
one lives in fine as one can. Still, one has the illusion of freedom;
therefore don't be, like me, without the memory of that illusion. I
was either, at the right time, too stupid or too intelligent to have
it; I don't quite know which. Of course at present I'm a case of
reaction against the mistake; and the voice of reaction should, no
doubt, always be taken with an allowance. But that doesn't affect the
point that the right time is now yours. The right time is ANY time
that one is still so lucky as to have. You've plenty; that's the great
thing; you're, as I say, damn you, so happily and hatefully young.
Don't at any rate miss things out of stupidity. Of course I don't take
you for a fool, or I shouldn't be addressing you thus awfully. Do what
you like so long as you don't make MY mistake. For it was a mistake.
Live!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>... Slowly and sociably, with full pauses and straight
dashes, Strether had so delivered himself; holding little Bilham from
step to step deeply and gravely attentive. The end of all was that the
young man had turned quite solemn, and that this was a contradiction of
the innocent gaiety the speaker had wished to promote. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) watched for
a moment the consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) words, and then, laying a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
listener's knee and as if to end with the proper joke: <div class="bookquote">``And now for
the eye I shall keep on you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>listener</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but I don't know that I want to be, at your age, too different from
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah prepare while you're about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``to be more amusing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham continued to think, but at last had a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you
ARE amusing--to ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impayable, as you say, no doubt. But what am I to myself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether
had risen with this, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) attention now to an encounter that, in
the middle of the garden, was in the act of taking place between their
host and the lady at whose side Madame de Vionnet had quitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). This
lady, who appeared within a few minutes to have left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friends,
awaited Gloriani's eager approach with words on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips that Strether
couldn't catch, but of which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) interesting witty face seemed to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the echo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was prompt and fine, but also that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had met her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) match, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) liked--in the light of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was quite sure
was the Duchess's latent insolence--the good humour with which the
great artist asserted equal resources. Were they, this pair, of the
<div class="bookquote">``great world'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?--and was he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) himself, for the moment and thus related to
them by his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) observation, IN it? Then there was something in the great
world covertly tigerish, which came to him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) across the lawn and in the
charming air as a waft from the jungle. Yet it made him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) admire most of
the two, made him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) envy, the glossy male tiger, magnificently marked.
These absurdities of the stirred sense, fruits of suggestion ripening
on the instant, were all reflected in his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) next words to little Bilham.
<div class="bookquote">``I know--if we talk of that--whom I should enjoy being like!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Little Bilham/Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) eyes; but then as with a shade of knowing
surprise: <div class="bookquote">``Gloriani?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Little Bilham/Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Our friend had in fact already hesitated, though not on the hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
companion's doubt, in which there were depths of critical reserve. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had just made out, in the now full picture, something and somebody
else; another impression had been superimposed. A young girl in a
white dress and a softly plumed white hat had suddenly come into view,
and what was presently clear was that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) course was toward them. What
was clearer still was that the handsome young man at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side was Chad
Newsome, and what was clearest of all was that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was therefore
Mademoiselle de Vionnet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was unmistakeably pretty--bright
gentle shy happy wonderful--and that Chad now, with a consummate
calculation of effect, was about to present her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) old friend's
vision. What was clearest of all indeed was something much more than
this, something at the single stroke of which--and wasn't it simply
juxtaposition?--all vagueness vanished. It was the click of a
spring--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) saw the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had by this time also met Chad's look;
there was more of it in that; and the truth, accordingly, so far as
Bilham's enquiry was concerned, had thrust in the answer. <div class="bookquote">``Oh
Chad!'' (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div>--it was that rare youth he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) should have enjoyed being <div class="bookquote">``like.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
virtuous attachment would be all there before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>); the virtuous
attachment would be in the very act of appeal for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) blessing; Jeanne
de Vionnet, this charming creature, would be exquisitely, intensely
now--the object of it. Chad brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) straight up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and Chad
was, oh yes, at this moment--for the glory of Woollett or
whatever--better still even than Gloriani. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had plucked this
blossom; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had kept it over-night in water; and at last as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) held it
up to wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) did enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) effect. That was why Strether had felt
at first the breath of calculation--and why moreover, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now knew,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) look at the girl would be, for the young man, a sign of the
latter's success. What young man had ever paraded about that way,
without a reason, a maiden in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flower? And there was nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
reason at present obscure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) type sufficiently told of it--they
wouldn't, they couldn't, want her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to go to Woollett. Poor Woollett,
and what it might miss!--though brave Chad indeed too, and what it
might gain! Brave Chad however had just excellently spoken. <div class="bookquote">``This is a
good little friend of mine who knows all about you and has moreover a
message for you. And this, my dear'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had turned to the child
herself--<div class="bookquote">``is the best man in the world, who has it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power to do a
great deal for us and whom I want you to like and revere as nearly as
possible as much as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood there quite pink, a little frightened, prettier and prettier
and not a bit like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother. There was in this last particular no
resemblance but that of youth to youth; and here was in fact suddenly
Strether's sharpest impression. It went wondering, dazed, embarrassed,
back to the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had just been talking with; it was a revelation in
the light of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) already saw she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would become more interesting. So
slim and fresh and fair, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had yet put forth this perfection; so that
for really believing it of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), for seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to any such developed
degree as a mother, comparison would be urgent. Well, what was it now
but fairly thrust upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``Mamma wishes me to tell you before we
go,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl said, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hopes very much you'll come to see us
very soon. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has something important to say to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) quite reproaches herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad helpfully explained: <div class="bookquote">``you were
interesting her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) so much when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) accidentally suffered you to be
interrupted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah don't mention it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether murmured, looking kindly from one to
the other and wondering at many things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm to ask you for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeanne/Jeanne de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>Jeanne continued with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) hands
clasped together as if in some small learnt prayer--<div class="bookquote">``I'm to ask you for
myself if you won't positively come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jeanne/Jeanne de Vionnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it to me, dear--I'll take care of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad genially declared in
answer to this, while Strether himself almost held his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) breath. What
was in the girl was indeed too soft, too unknown for direct dealing; so
that one could only gaze at it as at a picture, quite staying one's own
hand. But with Chad he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was now on ground--Chad he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could meet; so
pleasant a confidence in that and in everything did the young man
freely exhale. There was the whole of a story in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tone to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
companion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke indeed as if already of the family. It made
Strether guess the more quickly what it might be about which Madame de
Vionnet was so urgent. Having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) then she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had found him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) easy;
she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished to have it out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) that some way for the young people
must be discovered, some way that would not impose as a condition the
transplantation of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) already saw himself discussing
with this lady the attractions of Woollett as a residence for Chad's
companion. Was that youth going now to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the affair--so
that it would be after all with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``lady-friends''  (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div>that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
mother's missionary should be condemned to deal? It was quite as if
for an instant the two men looked at each other on this question. But
there was no mistaking at last Chad's pride in the display of such a
connexion. This was what had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) so carry himself while, three
minutes before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was bringing it into view; what had caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
friend, first catching sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), to be so struck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) air. It
was, in a word, just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thus finally felt Chad putting things
straight off on him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) envied him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had mentioned to little
Bilham, most. The whole exhibition however was but a matter of three
or four minutes, and the author of it had soon explained that, as
Madame de Vionnet was immediately going <div class="bookquote">``on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>this could be for Jeanne
but a snatch. They would all meet again soon, and Strether was
meanwhile to stay and amuse himself--<div class="bookquote">``I'll pick you up again in plenty
of time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took the girl off as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and Strether,
with the faint sweet foreignness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Au revoir, monsieur!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
ears as a note almost unprecedented, watched them recede side by side
and felt how, once more, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companion's relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) got an accent
from it. They disappeared among the others and apparently into the
house; whereupon our friend turned round to give out to little Bilham
the conviction of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was full. But there was no little Bilham
any more; little Bilham had within the few moments, for reasons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
own, proceeded further: a circumstance by which, in its order,
Strether was also sensibly affected.



<p/>III


<p/>Chad was not in fact on this occasion to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) promise of coming
back; but Miss Gostrey had soon presented herself with an explanation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) failure. There had been reasons at the last for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) going off
with ces dames; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) with much instance to come out and
take charge of their friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) did so, Strether felt as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
place beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), in a manner that left nothing to desire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
dropped back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) bench, alone again for a time, and the more
conscious for little Bilham's defection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) unexpressed thought; in
respect to which however this next converser was a still more capacious
vessel. <div class="bookquote">``It's the child!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had exclaimed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) almost as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) appeared; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) direct response was for some time delayed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) could feel in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) meanwhile the working of this truth. It might
have been simply, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) waited, that they were now in presence
altogether of truth spreading like a flood and not for the moment to be
offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) in the mere cupful; inasmuch as who should ces dames prove
to be but persons about whom--once thus face to face with them--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
found she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) might from the first have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) almost everything? This
would have freely come had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) taken the simple precaution of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
their name. There could be no better example--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) appeared to note
it with high amusement--than the way, making things out already so much
for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was at last throwing precautions to the winds. They
were neither more nor less, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) and the child's mother, than old
school-friends--friends who had scarcely met for years but whom this
unlooked-for chance had brought together with a rush. It was a relief,
Miss Gostrey hinted, to feel herself no longer groping; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was
unaccustomed to grope and as a general thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) might well have seen,
made straight enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) clue. With the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had now picked up
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) hands there need be at least no waste of wonder. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s coming
to see me--that's for YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether's counsellor continued; <div class="bookquote">``but I
don't require it to know where I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether counsellor</b></font>)</div><p/>The waste of wonder might be proscribed; but Strether,
characteristically, was even by this time in the immensity of space.
<div class="bookquote">``By which you mean that you know where SHE is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) just hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I mean that if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) comes to see me I shall--now
that I've pulled myself round a bit after the shock--not be at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hung poised. <div class="bookquote">``You call it--your recognition--a shock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) gave one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) rare flickers of impatience. <div class="bookquote">``It was a surprise,
an emotion. Don't be so literal. I wash my hands of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Strether's face lengthened. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s impossible--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s even more charming than I remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had to think how to put it. ``Well, I<div class="bookquote">``M impossible. It's
impossible. Everything's impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) an instant. <div class="bookquote">``I see where you're coming out.
Everything's possible.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Their eyes had on it in fact an exchange of
some duration; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pursued: <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it that beautiful
child?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) still said nothing: <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you mean to receive
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) answer in an instant rang clear. <div class="bookquote">``Because I wish to keep out of
the business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It provoked in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a weak wail. <div class="bookquote">``You're going to abandon me NOW?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm only going to abandon HER. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll want me to help her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) with
you. And I won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll only help me with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)? Well then--!''  (<font color='red'><b>the persons</b></font>)</div>Most of the persons
previously gathered had, in the interest of tea, passed into the house,
and they had the gardens mainly to themselves. The shadows were long,
the last call of the birds, who had made a home of their own in the
noble interspaced quarter, sounded from the high trees in the other
gardens as well, those of the old convent and of the old hotels; it was
as if our friends had waited for the full charm to come out. Strether's
impressions were still present; it was as if something had happened
that <div class="bookquote">``nailed''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>them, made them more intense; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to ask himself
soon afterwards, that evening, what really HAD happened--conscious as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could after all remain that for a gentleman taken, and taken the
first time, into the <div class="bookquote">``great world,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>the world of ambassadors and
duchesses, the items made a meagre total. It was nothing new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>),
however, as we know, that a man might have--at all events such a man as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--an amount of experience out of any proportion to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adventures; so
that, though it was doubtless no great adventure to sit on there with
Miss Gostrey and hear about Madame de Vionnet, the hour, the picture,
the immediate, the recent, the possible--as well as the communication
itself, not a note of which failed to reverberate--only gave the
moments more of the taste of history.

<p/>It was history, to begin with, that Jeanne's mother had been
three-and-twenty years before, at Geneva, schoolmate and good
girlfriend to Maria Gostrey, who had moreover enjoyed since then,
though interruptedly and above all with a long recent drop, other
glimpses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). Twenty-three years put them both on, no doubt; and
Madame de Vionnet--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had married straight after
school--couldn't be today an hour less than thirty-eight. This made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
ten years older than Chad--though ten years, also, if Strether liked,
older than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) looked; the least, at any rate, that a prospective
mother-in-law could be expected to do with. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) would be of all
mothers-in-law the most charming; unless indeed, through some
perversity as yet insupposeable, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) should utterly belie herself in
that relation. There was none surely in which, as Maria remembered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mustn't be charming; and this frankly in spite of the stigma
of failure in the tie where failure always most showed. It was no test
there--when indeed WAS it a test there?--for Monsieur de Vionnet had
been a brute. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had lived for years apart from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)--which was of
course always a horrid position; but Miss Gostrey's impression of the
matter had been that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) could scarce have made a better thing of it
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) done it on purpose to show she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was amiable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was so amiable
that nobody had had a word to say; which was luckily not the case for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was so impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had the advantage of all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) merits.

<p/>It was still history for Strether that the Comte de Vionnet--it being
also history that the lady in question was a Countess--should now,
under Miss Gostrey's sharp touch, rise before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as a high
distinguished polished impertinent reprobate, the product of a
mysterious order; it was history, further, that the charming girl so
freely sketched by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion should have been married out of hand
by a mother, another figure of striking outline, full of dark personal
motive; it was perhaps history most of all that this company was, as a
matter of course, governed by such considerations as put divorce out of
the question. <div class="bookquote">``Ces gens-la don't divorce, you know, any more than they
emigrate or abjure--they think it impious and vulgar'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; a fact in the
light of which they seemed but the more richly special. It was all
special; it was all, for Strether's imagination, more or less rich. The
girl at the Genevese school, an isolated interesting attaching
creature, then both sensitive and violent, audacious but always
forgiven, was the daughter of a French father and an English mother
who, early left a widow, had married again--tried afresh with a
foreigner; in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) career with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had apparently given her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) child
no example of comfort. All these people--the people of the English
mother's side--had been of condition more or less eminent; yet with
oddities and disparities that had often since made Maria, thinking them
over, wonder what they really quite rhymed to. It was in any case her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
belief that the mother, interested and prone to adventure, had been
without conscience, had only thought of ridding herself most quickly of
a possible, an actual encumbrance. The father, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) impression, a
Frenchman with a name one knew, had been a different matter, leaving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) clearly recalled, a memory all fondness, as well as an
assured little fortune which was unluckily to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) more or less of
a prey later on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been in particular, at school, dazzlingly,
though quite booklessly, clever; as polyglot as a little Jewess -LRB-which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wasn't, oh no!-RRB- and chattering French, English, German, Italian,
anything one would, in a way that made a clean sweep, if not of prizes
and parchments, at least of every <div class="bookquote">``part,''  (<font color='red'><b>mates</b></font>)</div>whether memorised or
improvised, in the curtained costumed school repertory, and in especial
of all mysteries of race and vagueness of reference, all swagger about
<div class="bookquote">``home,''  (<font color='red'><b>mates</b></font>)</div>among their variegated mates.

<p/>It would doubtless be difficult to-day, as between French and English,
to name her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) and place her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would certainly show, on knowledge, Miss
Gostrey felt, as one of those convenient types who don't keep you
explaining--minds with doors as numerous as the many-tongued cluster of
confessionals at Saint Peter's. You might confess to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) with
confidence in Roumelian, and even Roumelian sins. Therefore--! But
Strether's narrator covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) implication with a laugh; a laugh by
which his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) betrayal of a sense of the lurid in the picture was also
perhaps sufficiently protected. He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) had a moment of wondering, while
his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) friend went on, what sins might be especially Roumelian. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went
on at all events to the mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) having met the young
thing--again by some Swiss lake--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) first married state, which had
appeared for the few intermediate years not at least violently
disturbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had been lovely at that moment, delightful to HER, full
of responsive emotion, of amused recognitions and amusing reminders,
and then once more, much later, after a long interval, equally but
differently charming--touching and rather mystifying for the five
minutes of an encounter at a railway-station en province, during which
it had come out that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) life was all changed. Miss Gostrey had
understood enough to see, essentially, what had happened, and yet had
beautifully dreamed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was herself faultless. There were
doubtless depths in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was all right; Strether would see if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wasn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was another person however--that had been promptly
marked--from the small child of nature at the Geneva school, a little
person quite made over -LRB-as foreign women WERE, compared with American-RRB-
by marriage. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) situation too had evidently cleared itself up; there
would have been--all that was possible--a judicial separation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had
settled in Paris, brought up her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) daughter, steered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) boat. It was no
very pleasant boat--especially there--to be in; but Marie de Vionnet
would have headed straight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) would have friends, certainly--and
very good ones. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was at all events--and it was very
interesting. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) knowing Mr. Chad didn't in the least prove she (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) hadn't
friends; what it proved was what good ones HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had. <div class="bookquote">``I saw that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Gostrey, <div class="bookquote">``that night at the Francais; it came out for me in three
minutes. I saw HER--or somebody like her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). And so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) immediately
added, <div class="bookquote">``did you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--not anybody like her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed. <div class="bookquote">``But you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as
promptly went on, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has had such an influence on him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) feet; it was time for them to go. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) up for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes, as so often, in candid conference, through their settled
glasses, met over it long; after which Strether's again took in the
whole place. They were quite alone there now. <div class="bookquote">``Mustn't she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) rather--in
the time then--have rushed it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) won't of course have lost an hour. But that's just the good
mother--the good French one. You must remember that of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--that as a
mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s French, and that for them there's a special providence. It
precisely however--that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mayn't have been able to begin as far back
as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d have liked--makes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grateful for aid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether took this in as they slowly moved to the house on their way
out. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) counts on me then to put the thing through?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) counts on you. Oh and first of all of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey
added, <div class="bookquote">``on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--well, convincing you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) friend returned, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) caught Chad young!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but there are women who are for all your `times of life.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They're
the most wonderful sort.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had laughed the words out, but they brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) companion, the next
thing, to a stand. <div class="bookquote">``Is what you mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll try to make a fool of
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) WILL--with an opportunity--make.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you call,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked, <div class="bookquote">``an opportunity? My going to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah you must go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>--Miss Gostrey was a trifle evasive. <div class="bookquote">``You
can't not do that. You'd have gone to see the other woman. I mean if
there had been one--a different sort. It's what you came out for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It might be; but Strether distinguished. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't come out to see
THIS sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had a wonderful look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now. <div class="bookquote">``Are you disappointed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) isn't
worse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for a moment entertained the question, then found for it the
frankest of answers. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were worse she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d be better for our
purpose. It would be simpler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) admitted. <div class="bookquote">``But won't this be pleasanter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) promptly replied, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't come out--wasn't that
just what you originally reproached me with?--for the pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely. Therefore I say again what I said at first. You must take
things as they come. Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey added, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid for
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For yourself--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of your seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I trust her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). There's nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll say about
me. In fact there's nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) CAN.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered--little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had thought of this. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) broke
out. <div class="bookquote">``Oh you women!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something in it at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) flushed. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--there we are.
We're abysses.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``But I risk her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gave himself a shake. <div class="bookquote">``Well then so do I!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added as they
passed into the house that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would see Chad the first thing in the
morning.

<p/>This was the next day the more easily effected that the young man, as
it happened, even before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was down, turned up at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hotel. Strether
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) coffee, by habit, in the public room; but on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) descending
for this purpose Chad instantly proposed an adjournment to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
called greater privacy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had himself as yet had nothing--they would
sit down somewhere together; and when after a few steps and a turn into
the Boulevard they had, for their greater privacy, sat down among
twenty others, our friend saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companion's move a fear of the
advent of Waymarsh. It was the first time Chad had to that extent
given this personage <div class="bookquote">``away'' (<font color='red'><b>this personage</b></font>)</div>; and Strether found himself wondering of
what it was symptomatic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) made out in a moment that the youth was in
earnest as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't yet seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); which in its turn threw a ray
perhaps a trifle startling on what they had each up to that time been
treating as earnestness. It was sufficiently flattering however that
the real thing--if this WAS at last the real thing--should have been
determined, as appeared, precisely by an accretion of Strether's
importance. For this was what it quickly enough came to--that Chad,
rising with the lark, had rushed down to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) know while his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) morning
consciousness was yet young that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had literally made the afternoon
before a tremendous impression. Madame de Vionnet wouldn't, couldn't
rest till she (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should have some assurance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) WOULD consent
again to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). The announcement was made, across their
marble-topped table, while the foam of the hot milk was in their cups
and its plash still in the air, with the smile of Chad's easiest
urbanity; and this expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) face caused our friend's doubts to
gather on the spot into a challenge of the lips. <div class="bookquote">``See here'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--that was
all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) only for the moment said again <div class="bookquote">``See here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Chad met it with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) air of straight intelligence, while Strether remembered again that
fancy of the first impression of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), the happy young Pagan, handsome
and hard but oddly indulgent, whose mysterious measure he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had under the
street-lamp tried mentally to take. The young Pagan, while a long look
passed between them, sufficiently understood. Strether scarce needed
at last to say the rest--<div class="bookquote">``I want to know where I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said it,
adding before any answer something more. <div class="bookquote">``Are you engaged to be
married--is that your secret?--to the young lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) head with the slow amenity that was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) ways of
conveying that there was time for everything. <div class="bookquote">``I have no
secret--though I may have secrets! I haven't at any rate that one.
We're not engaged. No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then where's the hitch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean why I haven't already started with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad, beginning
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) coffee and buttering his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) roll, was quite ready to explain. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing
would have induced me--nothing will still induce me--not to try to keep
you here as long as you can be made to stay. It's too visibly good for
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether had himself plenty to say about this, but it was amusing
also to measure the march of Chad's tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had never been more a man
of the world, and it was always in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) company present to our friend
that one was seeing how in successive connexions a man of the world
acquitted himself. Chad kept it up beautifully. <div class="bookquote">``My idea--voyons!--is
simply that you should let Madame de Vionnet know you, simply that you
should consent to know HER. I don't in the least mind telling you
that, clever and charming as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s ever so much in my
confidence. All I ask of you is to let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) talk to you. You've asked me
about what you call my hitch, and so far as it goes she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll explain it
to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s herself my hitch, hang it--if you must really have it
all out. But in a sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hastened in the most wonderful manner to
add, <div class="bookquote">``that you'll quite make out for yourself. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s too good a friend,
confound her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Too good, I mean, for me to leave without--without--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) first hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Without what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, without my arranging somehow or other the damnable terms of my
sacrifice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It WILL be a sacrifice then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be the greatest loss I ever suffered. I owe her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>It was beautiful, the way Chad said these things, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) plea was now
confessedly--oh quite flagrantly and publicly--interesting. The moment
really took on for Strether an intensity. Chad owed Madame de Vionnet
so much? What DID that do then but clear up the whole mystery? He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was
indebted for alterations, and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thereby in a position to have
sent in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bill for expenses incurred in reconstruction. What was
this at bottom but what had been to be arrived at? Strether sat there
arriving at it while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) munched toast and stirred his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) second cup. To
do this with the aid of Chad's pleasant earnest face was also to do
more besides. No, never before had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) been so ready to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
was. What was it that had suddenly so cleared up? It was just
everybody's character; that is everybody's but--in a measure--his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own.
Strether felt HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) character receive for the instant a smutch from all
the wrong things he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had suspected or believed. The person to whom Chad
owed it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could positively turn out such a comfort to other
persons--such a person was sufficiently raised above any <div class="bookquote">``breath''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>by
the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>) work and the young man's steady light. All of which
was vivid enough to come and go quickly; though indeed in the midst of
it Strether could utter a question. <div class="bookquote">``Have I your word of honour that
if I surrender myself to Madame de Vionnet you'll surrender yourself to
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hand firmly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) friend's. <div class="bookquote">``My dear man, you have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>There was finally something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) felicity almost embarrassing and
oppressive--Strether had begun to fidget under it for the open air and
the erect posture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had signed to the waiter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wished to pay,
and this transaction took some moments, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thoroughly
felt, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put down money and pretended--it was quite hollow--to
estimate change, that Chad's higher spirit, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) youth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) practice,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) paganism, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) felicity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) assurance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) impudence, whatever it
might be, had consciously scored a success. Well, that was all right so
far as it went; his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sense of the thing in question covered our friend
for a minute like a veil through which--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been muffled--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) interlocutor ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mightn't take him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) over about five.
<div class="bookquote">``Over''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>was over the river, and over the river was where Madame de
Vionnet lived, and five was that very afternoon. They got at last out
of the place--got out before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) answered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) lighted, in the street, a
cigarette, which again gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) more time. But it was already sharp
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) that there was no use in time. <div class="bookquote">``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) propose to do to
me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had presently demanded.

<p/>Chad had no delays. <div class="bookquote">``Are you afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh immensely. Don't you see it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) won't do anything worse to you than make you
like her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just of that I'm afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's not fair to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether cast about. <div class="bookquote">``It's fair to your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``are you afraid of HER?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scarcely less. Or perhaps even more. But is this lady against your
interests at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not directly, no doubt; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s greatly in favour of them here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what--`here'--does she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) consider them to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, good relations!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is it that makes them so good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Well, that's exactly what you'll make out if you'll only go, as
I'm supplicating you, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with a little of the wanness, no doubt, that the
vision of more to <div class="bookquote">``make out''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>could scarce help producing. <div class="bookquote">``I mean HOW
good are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh awfully good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Strether had faltered, but it was brief. It was all very well,
but there was nothing now he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't risk. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, but I must
really--as I began by telling you--know where I am. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Bad'?'' (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>--Chad echoed it, but without a shock. <div class="bookquote">``Is that what's
implied--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When relations are good?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether felt a little silly, and was even
conscious of a foolish laugh, at having it imposed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to have
appeared to speak so. What indeed was he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) talking about? His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stare had
relaxed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked now all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). But something in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
back, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) still didn't know quite how to turn it. The two or
three ways he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thought of, and one of them in particular, were, even
with scruples dismissed, too ugly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) none the less at last found
something. <div class="bookquote">``Is her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life without reproach?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had found it, as pompous and priggish; so
much so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was thankful to Chad for taking it only in the right
spirit. The young man spoke so immensely to the point that the effect
was practically of positive blandness. <div class="bookquote">``Absolutely without reproach. A
beautiful life. Allez donc voir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>These last words were, in the liberality of their confidence, so
imperative that Strether went through no form of assent; but before
they separated it had been confirmed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should be picked up at a
quarter to five.





<p/>Book Sixth




<p/>I


<p/>It was quite by half-past five--after the two men had been together in
Madame de Vionnet's drawing-room not more than a dozen minutes--that
Chad, with a look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) watch and then another at their hostess, said
genially, gaily: <div class="bookquote">``I've an engagement, and I know you won't complain if
I leave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with you. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll interest you immensely; and as for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) declared to Strether, <div class="bookquote">``I assure you, if you're at all nervous, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s
perfectly safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had left them to be embarrassed or not by this guarantee, as they
could best manage, and embarrassment was a thing that Strether wasn't
at first sure Madame de Vionnet escaped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) escaped it himself, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
surprise; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had grown used by this time to thinking of himself as
brazen. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) occupied, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hostess, in the Rue de Bellechasse, the
first floor of an old house to which our visitors had had access from
an old clean court. The court was large and open, full of revelations,
for our friend, of the habit of privacy, the peace of intervals, the
dignity of distances and approaches; the house, to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) restless sense,
was in the high homely style of an elder day, and the ancient Paris
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was always looking for--sometimes intensely felt, sometimes
more acutely missed--was in the immemorial polish of the wide waxed
staircase and in the fine boiseries, the medallions, mouldings,
mirrors, great clear spaces, of the greyish-white salon into which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had been shown. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seemed at the very outset to see her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in the midst
of possessions not vulgarly numerous, but hereditary cherished
charming. While his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes turned after a little from those of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
hostess and Chad freely talked--not in the least about HIM, but about
other people, people he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) didn't know, and quite as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did know
them--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) found himself making out, as a background of the occupant,
some glory, some prosperity of the First Empire, some Napoleonic
glamour, some dim lustre of the great legend; elements clinging still
to all the consular chairs and mythological brasses and sphinxes' heads
and faded surfaces of satin striped with alternate silk.

<p/>The place itself went further back--that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) guessed, and how old Paris
continued in a manner to echo there; but the post-revolutionary period,
the world he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) vaguely thought of as the world of Chateaubriand, of
Madame de Stael, even of the young Lamartine, had left its stamp of
harps and urns and torches, a stamp impressed on sundry small objects,
ornaments and relics. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had never before, to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knowledge, had
present to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) relics, of any special dignity, of a private
order--little old miniatures, medallions, pictures, books; books in
leather bindings, pinkish and greenish, with gilt garlands on the back,
ranged, together with other promiscuous properties, under the glass of
brass-mounted cabinets. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) attention took them all tenderly into
account. They were among the matters that marked Madame de Vionnet's
apartment as something quite different from Miss Gostrey's little
museum of bargains and from Chad's lovely home; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) recognised it as
founded much more on old accumulations that had possibly from time to
time shrunken than on any contemporary method of acquisition or form of
curiosity. Chad and Miss Gostrey had rummaged and purchased and picked
up and exchanged, sifting, selecting, comparing; whereas the mistress
of the scene before him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), beautifully passive under the spell of
transmission--transmission from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) father's line, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quite made up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
mind--had only received, accepted and been quiet. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hadn't been
quiet she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had been moved at the most to some occult charity for some
fallen fortune. There had been objects she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) predecessors might
even conceivably have parted with under need, but Strether couldn't
suspect them of having sold old pieces to get <div class="bookquote">``better''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>ones. They
would have felt no difference as to better or worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could but
imagine their having felt--perhaps in emigration, in proscription, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sketch was slight and confused--the pressure of want or the
obligation of sacrifice.

<p/>The pressure of want--whatever might be the case with the other
force--was, however, presumably not active now, for the tokens of a
chastened ease still abounded after all, many marks of a taste whose
discriminations might perhaps have been called eccentric. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) guessed
at intense little preferences and sharp little exclusions, a deep
suspicion of the vulgar and a personal view of the right. The general
result of this was something for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had no name on the spot quite
ready, but something he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have come nearest to naming in speaking
of it as the air of supreme respectability, the consciousness, small,
still, reserved, but none the less distinct and diffused, of private
honour. The air of supreme respectability--that was a strange blank
wall for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) adventure to have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nose against.
It had in fact, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was now aware, filled all the approaches, hovered
in the court as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) passed, hung on the staircase as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mounted, sounded
in the grave rumble of the old bell, as little electric as possible, of
which Chad, at the door, had pulled the ancient but neatly-kept tassel;
it formed in short the clearest medium of its particular kind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had ever breathed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would have answered for it at the end of a
quarter of an hour that some of the glass cases contained swords and
epaulettes of ancient colonels and generals; medals and orders once
pinned over hearts that had long since ceased to beat; snuff-boxes
bestowed on ministers and envoys; copies of works presented, with
inscriptions, by authors now classic. At bottom of it all for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was
the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) rare unlikeness to the women he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had known. This sense
had grown, since the day before, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and had been
above all singularly fed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) talk with Chad in the morning.
Everything in fine made her (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) immeasurably new, and nothing so new as the
old house and the old objects. There were books, two or three, on a
small table near his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) chair, but they hadn't the lemon-coloured covers
with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) eye had begun to dally from the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) arrival and
to the opportunity of a further acquaintance with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had for a
fortnight now altogether succumbed. On another table, across the room,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) made out the great _Revue_; but even that familiar face, conspicuous
in Mrs. Newsome's parlours, scarce counted here as a modern note. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
was sure on the spot--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) afterwards knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was right--that this
was a touch of Chad's own hand. What would Mrs. Newsome say to the
circumstance that Chad's interested <div class="bookquote">``influence''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) paper-knife in
the _Revue_? The interested influence at any rate had, as we say, gone
straight to the point--had in fact soon left it quite behind.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was seated, near the fire, on a small stuffed and fringed chair one
of the few modern articles in the room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) leaned back in it with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hands clasped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) lap and no movement, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) person, but
the fine prompt play of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) deep young face. The fire, under the low
white marble, undraped and academic, had burnt down to the silver ashes
of light wood, one of the windows, at a distance, stood open to the
mildness and stillness, out of which, in the short pauses, came the
faint sound, pleasant and homely, almost rustic, of a plash and a
clatter of sabots from some coach-house on the other side of the court.
Madame de Vionnet, while Strether sat there, wasn't to shift her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
posture by an inch. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you seriously believe in what you're
doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but all the same, you know, I'm going to treat you
quite as if I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By which you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether directly replied, <div class="bookquote">``quite as if you
didn't! I assure you it won't make the least difference with me how
you treat me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) said, taking that menace bravely and philosophically
enough, <div class="bookquote">``the only thing that really matters is that you shall get on
with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) immediately returned.

<p/>It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) another pause; which, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) happily enough shook
off. <div class="bookquote">``Will you consent to go on with me a little--provisionally--as if
you did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw how she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had decidedly come all the way; and
there accompanied it an extraordinary sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) raising from
somewhere below him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) beautiful suppliant eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might have been
perched at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) door-step or at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) window and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) standing in the road.
For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) stand and couldn't moreover have spoken. It
had been sad, of a sudden, with a sadness that was like a cold breath
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``What can I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) finally asked, <div class="bookquote">``but listen to you as
I promised Chadwick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but what I'm asking you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) quickly said, <div class="bookquote">``isn't what Mr. Newsome
had in mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) spoke at present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw, as if to take courageously
ALL her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) risk. <div class="bookquote">``This is my own idea and a different thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It gave poor Strether in truth--uneasy as it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) too--something of
the thrill of a bold perception justified. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) answered kindly
enough, <div class="bookquote">``I was sure a moment since that some idea of your own had come
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) seemed still to look up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), but now more serenely. <div class="bookquote">``I made out
you were sure--and that helped it to come. So you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) continued,
<div class="bookquote">``we do get on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but it appears to me I don't at all meet your request. How can I
when I don't understand it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't at all necessary you should understand; it will do quite well
enough if you simply remember it. Only feel I trust you--and for
nothing so tremendous after all. Just,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) said with a wonderful
smile, <div class="bookquote">``for common civility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had a long pause while they sat again face to face, as they
had sat, scarce less conscious, before the poor lady had crossed the
stream. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the poor lady for Strether now because clearly she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
some trouble, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could only mean that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) trouble
was deep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) couldn't help it; it wasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fault; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had done
nothing; but by a turn of the hand she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had somehow made their encounter
a relation. And the relation profited by a mass of things that were
not strictly in it or of it; by the very air in which they sat, by the
high cold delicate room, by the world outside and the little plash in
the court, by the First Empire and the relics in the stiff cabinets, by
matters as far off as those and by others as near as the unbroken clasp
of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lap and the look her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expression had of being most
natural when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes were most fixed. <div class="bookquote">``You count upon me of course
for something really much greater than it sounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh it sounds great enough too!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laughed at this.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found himself in time on the point of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, as
Miss Barrace called it, wonderful; but, catching himself up, he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said
something else instead. <div class="bookquote">``What was it Chad's idea then that you should
say to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) idea was simply what a man's idea always is--to put every
effort off on the woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The `woman'--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether slowly echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) likes--and just in proportion as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) likes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). In
proportion too--for shifting the trouble--as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) likes HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether followed it; then with an abruptness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own: <div class="bookquote">``How much do
you like Chad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as much as THAT--to take all, with you, on myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) got
at once again away from this. <div class="bookquote">``I've been trembling as if we were to
stand or fall by what you may think of me; and I'm even now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) went
on wonderfully, <div class="bookquote">``drawing a long breath--and, yes, truly taking a great
courage--from the hope that I don't in fact strike you as impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's at all events, clearly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) observed after an instant, <div class="bookquote">``the way
I don't strike YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) so far assented, ``as you haven't yet said you WON<div class="bookquote">``T have
the little patience with me I ask for--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You draw splendid conclusions? Perfectly. But I don't understand
them,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Strether pursued. <div class="bookquote">``You seem to me to ask for much more than you
need. What, at the worst for you, what at the best for myself, can I
after all do? I can use no pressure that I haven't used. You come
really late with your request. I've already done all that for myself
the case admits of. I've said my say, and here I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, here you are, fortunately!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs.
Newsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) added in another tone, <div class="bookquote">``didn't think you can do so
little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had an hesitation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) brought the words out. <div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) thinks
so now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean by that--?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) also hung fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I mean what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) still rather faltered. <div class="bookquote">``Pardon me if I touch on it, but if I'm
saying extraordinary things, why, perhaps, mayn't I? Besides, doesn't
it properly concern us to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To know what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) insisted as after thus beating about the bush she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>)
had again dropped.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) made the effort. <div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) given you up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was amazed afterwards to think how simply and quietly he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had met it.
<div class="bookquote">``Not yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) were a trifle disappointed--had
expected still more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) freedom. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) went straight on. <div class="bookquote">``Is that
what Chad has told you will happen to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) was evidently charmed with the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) took it. <div class="bookquote">``If you mean if
we've talked of it--most certainly. And the question's not what has
had least to do with my wishing to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To judge if I'm the sort of man a woman CAN--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``you wonderful gentleman! I do judge--I
HAVE judged. A woman can't. You're safe--with every right to be.
You'd be much happier if you'd only believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether was silent a little; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found himself speaking with a
cynicism of confidence of which even at the moment the sources were
strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I try to believe it. But it's a marvel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``how YOU already get at it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) was able to say. <div class="bookquote">``Remember how much I was on the way to it
through Mr. Newsome--before I saw you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) thinks everything of your
strength.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I can bear almost anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>our friend briskly interrupted.
Deep and beautiful on this her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) smile came back, and with the effect of
making him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had said just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) had heard it. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) easily
enough felt that it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) away, but what in truth had everything
done but that? It had been all very well to think at moments that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) nose down and that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had coerced her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>): what had he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) by
this time done but let her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) practically see that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) accepted their
relation? What was their relation moreover--though light and brief
enough in form as yet--but whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) might choose to make it?
Nothing could prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>)--certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) couldn't--from making it
pleasant. At the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head, behind everything, was the sense
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) was--there, before him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), close to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), in vivid imperative
form--one of the rare women he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had so often heard of, read of, thought
of, but never met, whose very presence, look, voice, the mere
contemporaneous FACT of whom, from the moment it was at all presented,
made a relation of mere recognition. That was not the kind of woman he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had ever found Mrs. Newsome, a contemporaneous fact who had been
distinctly slow to establish herself; and at present, confronted with
Madame de Vionnet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt the simplicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) original impression of
Miss Gostrey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) certainly had been a fact of rapid growth; but the
world was wide, each day was more and more a new lesson. There were at
any rate even among the stranger ones relations and relations. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course I suit Chad's grand way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) quickly added. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hasn't had much
difficulty in working me in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) seemed to deny a little, on the young man's behalf, by the rise of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) eyebrows, an intention of any process at all inconsiderate. <div class="bookquote">``You
must know how grieved he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'d be if you were to lose anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
believes you can keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother patient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). ``I see. THAT<div class="bookquote">``S then what you
really want of me. And how am I to do it? Perhaps you'll tell me
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Simply tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you call the truth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, any truth--about us all--that you see yourself. I leave it to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much. I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed with a slight
harshness, <div class="bookquote">``the way you leave things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) insisted kindly, gently, as if it wasn't so bad. <div class="bookquote">``Be perfectly
honest. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) oddly echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the simple truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet again pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is the simple truth? The simple truth is exactly what I'm
trying to discover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) looked about a while, but presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), fully and clearly, about US.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether meanwhile had been staring. <div class="bookquote">``You and your daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--little Jeanne and me. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) just slightly quavered,
<div class="bookquote">``you like us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what good will that do me? Or rather'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) caught himself
up--<div class="bookquote">``what good will it do YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) looked graver. <div class="bookquote">``None, you believe, really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether debated. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) didn't send me out to `like' you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) charmingly contended, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) sent you out to face the facts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) admitted after an instant that there was something in that. <div class="bookquote">``But
how can I face them till I know what they are? Do you want him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
then braced himself to ask, <div class="bookquote">``to marry your daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) gave a headshake as noble as it was prompt. <div class="bookquote">``No--not that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) really doesn't want to himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) repeated the movement, but now with a strange light in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) likes her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered. <div class="bookquote">``To be willing to consider, you mean, the question
of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to America?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be willing to do anything with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) but be immensely kind and
nice--really tender of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). We watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and you must help us.
You must see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether felt awkward. <div class="bookquote">``Ah with pleasure--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s so remarkably
attractive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother's eagerness with which Madame de Vionnet jumped at this was
to come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) later as beautiful in its grace. <div class="bookquote">``The dear thing
DID please you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) met it with the largest <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of
enthusiasm: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s perfect. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s my joy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm sure that--if one were near her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and saw more of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'d
be mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Vionnet, <div class="bookquote">``tell Mrs. Newsome that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wondered the more. <div class="bookquote">``What good will that do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) appeared
unable at once to say, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) brought out something else. <div class="bookquote">``Is
your daughter in love with our friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) rather startlingly answered, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd find out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I? A stranger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you won't be a stranger--presently. You shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) quite, I
assure you, as if you weren't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It remained for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) none the less an extraordinary notion. <div class="bookquote">``It seems
to me surely that if her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother can't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah little girls and their mothers to-day!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) rather inconsequently
broke in. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) checked herself with something she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) seemed to give
out as after all more to the point. <div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) I've been good for him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
Don't you think I have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It had its effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)--more than at the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) quite measured.
Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was consciously enough touched. <div class="bookquote">``Oh if it's all you--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it may not be `all,'''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``but it's to a great
extent. Really and truly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) added in a tone that was to take its
place with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) among things remembered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's very wonderful.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) from a face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt
as strained, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) own face for a moment kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) so. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
also got up. <div class="bookquote">``Well, don't you think that for that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to save you?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>So it was that the way to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)--and the
way, as well, in a manner, to get off--came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) heard himself
use the exorbitant word, the very sound of which helped to determine
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) flight. <div class="bookquote">``I'll save you if I can.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>II


<p/>In Chad's lovely home, however, one evening ten days later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt
himself present at the collapse of the question of Jeanne de Vionnet's
shy secret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had been dining there in the company of that young lady
and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother, as well as of other persons, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had gone into the
petit salon, at Chad's request, on purpose to talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The young
man had put this to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a favour--<div class="bookquote">``I should like so awfully to know
what you think of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). It will really be a chance for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
said, <div class="bookquote">``to see the jeune fille--I mean the type--as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) actually is, and
I don't think that, as an observer of manners, it's a thing you ought
to miss. It will be an impression that--whatever else you take--you
can carry home with you, where you'll find again so much to compare it
with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether knew well enough with what Chad wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to compare it, and
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) entirely assented he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't yet somehow been so deeply
reminded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was being, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) constantly though mutely expressed
it, used. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was as far as ever from making out exactly to what end;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was none the less constantly accompanied by a sense of the
service he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) rendered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) conceived only that this service was highly
agreeable to those who profited by it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was indeed still waiting
for the moment at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should catch it in the act of proving
disagreeable, proving in some degree intolerable, to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
failed quite to see how his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) situation could clear up at all logically
except by some turn of events that would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) the pretext of
disgust. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was building from day to day on the possibility of
disgust, but each day brought forth meanwhile a new and more engaging
bend of the road. That possibility was now ever so much further from
sight than on the eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) arrival, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) perfectly felt that,
should it come at all, it would have to be at best inconsequent and
violent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) struck himself as a little nearer to it only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) asked
himself what service, in such a life of utility, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was after all
rendering Mrs. Newsome. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wished to help himself to believe that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was still all right he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) reflected--and in fact with wonder--on the
unimpaired frequency of their correspondence; in relation to which what
was after all more natural than that it should become more frequent
just in proportion as their problem became more complicated?

<p/>Certain it is at any rate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) now often brought himself balm by the
question, with the rich consciousness of yesterday's letter, <div class="bookquote">``Well,
what can I do more than that--what can I do more than tell her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
everything?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) did tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>),
everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) used to try to think of particular things he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). When at rare moments and in the watches of the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) pounced
on one it generally showed itself to be--to a deeper scrutiny--not
quite truly of the essence. When anything new struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as coming up,
or anything already noted as reappearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) always immediately wrote,
as if for fear that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would miss something; and also that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might be able to say to himself from time to time <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) knows it
NOW--even while I worry.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was a great comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) in general not
to have left past things to be dragged to light and explained; not to
have to produce at so late a stage anything not produced, or anything
even veiled and attenuated, at the moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) knew it now: that was
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) said to himself to-night in relation to the fresh fact of
Chad's acquaintance with the two ladies--not to speak of the fresher
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own. Mrs. Newsome knew in other words that very night at
Woollett that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) himself knew Madame de Vionnet and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
conscientiously been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>); also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) remarkably
attractive and that there would probably be a good deal more to tell.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) further knew, or would know very soon, that, again
conscientiously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) visit; and that when Chad had
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) on the Countess's behalf--Strether made her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) out vividly, with
a thought at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head, a Countess--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't name a
day for dining with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had replied lucidly: <div class="bookquote">``Thank you very
much--impossible.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had begged the young man would present his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
excuses and had trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to understand that it couldn't really
strike one as quite the straight thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't reported to Mrs.
Newsome that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had promised to <div class="bookquote">``save''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet; but, so far
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was concerned with that reminiscence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) hadn't at any rate
promised to haunt her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) house. What Chad had understood could only, in
truth, be inferred from Chad's behaviour, which had been in this
connexion as easy as in every other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was easy, always, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
understood; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was easier still, if possible, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would make it all right; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had proceeded to do
this by substituting the present occasion--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was ready to
substitute others--for any, for every occasion as to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) old
friend should have a funny scruple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but I'm not a little foreign girl; I'm just as English as I can
be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jeanne/Jeanne de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>Jeanne de Vionnet had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as soon as, in the petit salon,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sank, shyly enough on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own side, into the place near her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) vacated
by Madame Gloriani at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) approach. Madame Gloriani, who was in black
velvet, with white lace and powdered hair, and whose somewhat massive
majesty melted, at any contact, into the graciousness of some
incomprehensible tongue, moved away to make room for the vague
gentleman, after benevolent greetings to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) which embodied, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
believed, in baffling accents, some recognition of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face from a
couple of Sundays before. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had remarked--making the most of the
advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) years--that it frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quite enough to find
himself dedicated to the entertainment of a little foreign girl. There
were girls he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wasn't afraid of--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was quite bold with little
Americans. Thus it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had defended herself to the end--<div class="bookquote">``Oh
but I'm almost American too. That's what mamma has wanted me to be--I
mean LIKE that; for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has wanted me to have lots of freedom. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has
known such good results from it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was fairly beautiful to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)--a faint pastel in an oval frame: he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) already as of some lurking image in a long gallery, the
portrait of a small old-time princess of whom nothing was known but
that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had died young. Little Jeanne wasn't, doubtless, to die
young, but one couldn't, all the same, bear on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) lightly enough. It
was bearing hard, it was bearing as HE (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), in any case, wouldn't bear, to
concern himself, in relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>), with the question of a young man.
Odious really the question of a young man; one didn't treat such a
person as a maid-servant suspected of a <div class="bookquote">``follower.''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>And then young
men, young men--well, the thing was their business simply, or was at
all events hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) was fluttered, fairly fevered--to the point of a
little glitter that came and went in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) eyes and a pair of pink spots
that stayed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) cheeks--with the great adventure of dining out and
with the greater one still, possibly, of finding a gentleman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)
must think of as very, very old, a gentleman with eye-glasses,
wrinkles, a long grizzled moustache. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) spoke the prettiest English,
our friend thought, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had ever heard spoken, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) a few minutes before to be speaking the prettiest French.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wondered almost wistfully if such a sweep of the lyre didn't react
on the spirit itself; and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fancy had in fact, before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew it,
begun so to stray and embroider that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) finally found himself, absent
and extravagant, sitting with the child in a friendly silence. Only by
this time he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) flutter to have fortunately dropped and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)
was more at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) ease. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), liked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and it was to come
back to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) afterwards that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had dipped
into the waiting medium at last and found neither surge nor
chill--nothing but the small splash she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) could herself make in the
pleasant warmth, nothing but the safety of dipping and dipping again.
At the end of the ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was to spend with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
impression--with all it had thrown off and all it had taken in--was
complete. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had been free, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) knew freedom, partly to show him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
that, unlike other little persons she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had imbibed that ideal.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) was delightfully quaint about herself, but the vision of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)
had imbibed was what most held him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). It really consisted, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was soon
enough to feel, in just one great little matter, the fact that,
whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) nature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) was thoroughly--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had to cast about for the
word, but it came--bred. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) couldn't of course on so short an
acquaintance speak for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) nature, but the idea of breeding was what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had meanwhile dropped into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had never yet known it so
sharply presented. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) mother gave it, no doubt; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) mother, to
make that less sensible, gave so much else besides, and on neither of
the two previous occasions, extraordinary woman, Strether felt,
anything like what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was giving tonight. Little Jeanne was a case,
an exquisite case of education; whereas the Countess, whom it so amused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to think of by that denomination, was a case, also exquisite,
of--well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't know what.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>follower</b></font>) has wonderful taste, notre jeune homme'' (<font color='red'><b>Gloriani/Madame Gloriani</b></font>)</div>: this was what Gloriani
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) on turning away from the inspection of a small picture
suspended near the door of the room. The high celebrity in question
had just come in, apparently in search of Mademoiselle de Vionnet, but
while Strether had got up from beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) their fellow guest, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
eye sharply caught, had paused for a long look. The thing was a
landscape, of no size, but of the French school, as our friend was glad
to feel he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew, and also of a quality--which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) liked to think he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
should also have guessed; its frame was large out of proportion to the
canvas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had never seen a person look at anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought,
just as Gloriani, with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) nose very near and quick movements of the
head from side to side and bottom to top, examined this feature of
Chad's collection. The artist used that word the next moment smiling
courteously, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) nippers and looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) further--paying
the place in short by the very manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) presence and by something
Strether fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could make out in this particular glance, such a
tribute as, to the latter's sense, settled many things once for all.
Strether was conscious at this instant, for that matter, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't
yet been, of how, round about him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), quite without him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), they WERE
consistently settled. Gloriani's smile, deeply Italian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) considered,
and finely inscrutable, had had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), during dinner, at which they
were not neighbours, an indefinite greeting; but the quality in it was
gone that had appeared on the other occasion to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) inside out; it
was as if even the momentary link supplied by the doubt between them
had snapped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was conscious now of the final reality, which was that
there wasn't so much a doubt as a difference altogether; all the more
that over the difference the famous sculptor seemed to signal almost
condolingly, yet oh how vacantly! as across some great flat sheet of
water. He (<font color='blue'><b>sculptor</b></font>) threw out the bridge of a charming hollow civility on which
Strether wouldn't have trusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own full weight a moment. That
idea, even though but transient and perhaps belated, had performed the
office of putting Strether more at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ease, and the blurred picture
had already dropped--dropped with the sound of something else said and
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) becoming aware, by another quick turn, that Gloriani was now
on the sofa talking with Jeanne, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ears again
the familiar friendliness and the elusive meaning of the <div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, oh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), a fortnight before, challenge Miss Barrace in vain.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had always the air, this picturesque and original lady, who struck
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), so oddly, as both antique and modern--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had always the air of
taking up some joke that one had already had out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>). The point
itself, no doubt, was what was antique, and the use she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) made of it what
was modern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt just now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) good-natured irony did bear on
something, and it troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a little that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) wouldn't be more
explicit only assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), with the pleasure of observation so visible
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) wouldn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) more for the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could take
refuge but in asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had done with Waymarsh, though it
must be added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt himself a little on the way to a clue after
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had answered that this personage was, in the other room, engaged in
conversation with Madame de Vionnet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) stared a moment at the image
of such a conjunction; then, for Miss Barrace's benefit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wondered.
<div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) too then under the charm--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not a bit'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Miss Barrace was prompt. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) makes nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>follower</b></font>).

affairs in hand, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could. I've never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barrace</b></font>)</div>said Miss Barrace,

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barrace</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether understood, so far as that went; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was feeling for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)

quality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) acutely admitted, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) IS different. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s gay.''

puffs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) cigarette, of the drollery of things, appeared to find
their conversation highly delightful. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it isn't her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders .''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether earnestly enquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's SHE--simply. It's her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mood. It's her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it's her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) charm, but we're speaking of the difference.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barrace</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace explained, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s just brilliant, as we used to
say. That's all. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s various. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s fifty women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barrace</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but only one'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether kept it clear--<div class="bookquote">``at a time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps. But in fifty times--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh we shan't come to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>our friend declared; and the next moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had moved in another direction. <div class="bookquote">``Will you answer me a plain
question? Will she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ever divorce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Barrace looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) through all her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) tortoise-shell. <div class="bookquote">``Why should
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It wasn't what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had asked for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) signified; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) met it well
enough. <div class="bookquote">``To marry Chad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marry Chad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I'm convinced she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has done wonders
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) do more? Marrying a man, or woman either,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace sagely went on, <div class="bookquote">``is never the wonder for any Jack and Jill
can bring THAT off. The wonder is their doing such things without
marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether considered a moment this proposition. <div class="bookquote">``You mean it's so
beautiful for our friends simply to go on so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said made her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nevertheless insisted. <div class="bookquote">``And THAT because it's disinterested?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) was now, however, suddenly tired of the question. <div class="bookquote">``Yes then--call
it that. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jill</b></font>)'ll never divorce. Don't, moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``believe everything you hear about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jill</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s not then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked, <div class="bookquote">``a wretch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. But charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've met him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s bien aimable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To every one but his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh for all I know, to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) too--to any, to every woman. I hope you at
any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) pursued with a quick change, <div class="bookquote">``appreciate the care I take
of Mr. Waymarsh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh immensely.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>But Strether was not yet in line. <div class="bookquote">``At all events,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
roundly brought out, <div class="bookquote">``the attachment's an innocent one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)? Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``don't rob it of ALL interest!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean our friend's here--to the lady we've been speaking of.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That
was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had settled to as an indirect but none the less closely
involved consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) impression of Jeanne. That was where he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
meant to stay. <div class="bookquote">``It's innocent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) repeated--<div class="bookquote">``I see the whole thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mystified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) abrupt declaration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had glanced over at Gloriani
as at the unnamed subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) allusion, but the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had
understood; though indeed not before Strether had noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) momentary
mistake and wondered what might possibly be behind that too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
already knew that the sculptor admired Madame de Vionnet; but did this
admiration also represent an attachment of which the innocence was
discussable? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was moving verily in a strange air and on ground not
of the firmest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) looked hard for an instant at Miss Barrace, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)
had already gone on. <div class="bookquote">``All right with Mr. Newsome? Why of course she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
is!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) got gaily back to the question of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) own good friend. <div class="bookquote">``I
dare say you're surprised that I'm not worn out with all I see--it
being so much!--of Sitting Bull. But I'm not, you know--I don't mind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>); I bear up, and we get on beautifully. I'm very strange; I'm like
that; and often I can't explain. There are people who are supposed
interesting or remarkable or whatever, and who bore me to death; and
then there are others as to whom nobody can understand what anybody
sees in them--in whom I see no end of things.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then after she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had
smoked a moment, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s touching, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Know'?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Strether echoed--<div class="bookquote">``don't I, indeed? We must move you almost
to tears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but I don't mean YOU!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to then, for the worst sign of all--as I must have it for
you--is that you can't help me. That's when a woman pities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but I do help you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) cheerfully insisted.

<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) hard, and then after a pause: <div class="bookquote">``No you don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) tortoise-shell, on its long chain, rattled down. <div class="bookquote">``I help you with
Sitting Bull. That's a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh that, yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>But Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) talks of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that I have to defend you? No, never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether mused. <div class="bookquote">``It's too deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) only fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) returned--<div class="bookquote">``that everything, with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), is
too deep. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has depths of silence--which he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) breaks only at the
longest intervals by a remark. And when the remark comes it's always
something he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has seen or felt for himself--never a bit banal THAT would
be what one might have feared and what would kill me But never.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)
smoked again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) thus, with amused complacency, appreciated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)
acquisition. <div class="bookquote">``And never about you. We keep clear of you. We're
wonderful. But I'll tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
tries to make me presents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Presents?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>poor Strether echoed, conscious with a pang that HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't
yet tried that in any quarter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s as fine as ever in the victoria; so
that when I leave him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), as I often do almost for hours--he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) likes it
so--at the doors of shops, the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) there helps me, when I come
out, to know my carriage away off in the rank. But sometimes, for a
change, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) goes with me into the shops, and then I've all I can do to
prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) buying me things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wants to `treat' you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether almost gasped at all he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself
hadn't thought of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had a sense of admiration. <div class="bookquote">``Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s much more
in the real tradition than I. Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mused, <div class="bookquote">``it's the sacred rage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sacred rage, exactly!'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Barrace</b></font>)</div>--and Miss Barrace, who hadn't before heard
this term applied, recognised its bearing with a clap of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) gemmed
hands. <div class="bookquote">``Now I do know why he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s not banal. But I do prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) all
the same--and if you saw what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sometimes selects--from buying. I
save him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hundreds and hundreds. I only take flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Flowers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether echoed again with a rueful reflexion. How many
nosegays had her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) present converser sent?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Innocent flowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) likes. And he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sends me
splendours; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knows all the best places--he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has found them for
himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hasn't told them to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) friend smiled, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has a life of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
own.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>But Strether had swung back to the consciousness that for
himself after all it never would have done. Waymarsh hadn't Mrs.
Waymarsh in the least to consider, whereas Lambert Strether had
constantly, in the inmost honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thoughts, to consider Mrs.
Newsome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) liked moreover to feel how much his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend was in the real
tradition. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) conclusion. <div class="bookquote">``WHAT a rage it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
worked it out. <div class="bookquote">``It's an opposition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) followed, but at a distance. <div class="bookquote">``That's what I feel. Yet to what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thinks, you know, that I<div class="bookquote">``VE a life of my own. And I haven't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) showed doubt, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) laugh confirmed it. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh,
oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not for myself. I seem to have a life only for other people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah for them and WITH them! Just now for instance with--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, with whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked before she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had had time to say.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) tone had the effect of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hesitate and even, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) guessed,
speak with a difference. <div class="bookquote">``Say with Miss Gostrey. What do you do for
HER?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It really made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wonder. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing at all!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div><p/>III


<p/>Madame de Vionnet, having meanwhile come in, was at present close to
them, and Miss Barrace hereupon, instead of risking a rejoinder, became
again with a look that measured her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) from top to toe all mere
long-handled appreciative tortoise-shell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had struck our friend,
from the first of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) appearing, as dressed for a great occasion, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) met still more than on either of the others the conception
reawakened in him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at their garden-party, the idea of the femme du monde
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) habit as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) lived. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) bare shoulders and arms were white and
beautiful; the materials of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) dress, a mixture, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) supposed, of
silk and crape, were of a silvery grey so artfully composed as to give
an impression of warm splendour; and round her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) neck she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) wore a collar
of large old emeralds, the green note of which was more dimly repeated,
at other points of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) apparel, in embroidery, in enamel, in satin, in
substances and textures vaguely rich. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) head, extremely fair and
exquisitely festal, was like a happy fancy, a notion of the antique, on
an old precious medal, some silver coin of the Renaissance; while her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
slim lightness and brightness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) gaiety, her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) expression, her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
decision, contributed to an effect that might have been felt by a poet
as half mythological and half conventional. He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) could have compared her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
to a goddess still partly engaged in a morning cloud, or to a sea-nymph
waist-high in the summer surge. Above all she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) the
reflexion that the femme du monde--in these finest developments of the
type--was, like Cleopatra in the play, indeed various and multifold.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) had aspects, characters, days, nights--or had them at least, showed
them by a mysterious law of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) own, when in addition to everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>)
happened also to be a woman of genius. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) was an obscure person, a
muffled person one day, and a showy person, an uncovered person the
next. He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) thought of Madame de Vionnet to-night as showy and uncovered,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) felt the formula rough, because, thanks to one of the
short-cuts of genius she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) had taken all his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) categories by surprise.
Twice during dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had met Chad's eyes in a longish look; but these
communications had in truth only stirred up again old ambiguities--so
little was it clear from them whether they were an appeal or an
admonition. <div class="bookquote">``You see how I'm fixed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was what they appeared to convey;
yet how he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) was fixed was exactly what Strether didn't see. However,
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should see now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you capable of the very great kindness of going to relieve
Newsome, for a few minutes, of the rather crushing responsibility of
Madame Gloriani, while I say a word, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'ll allow me, to Mr.
Strether, of whom I've a question to ask? Our host ought to talk a bit
to those other ladies, and I'll come back in a minute to your rescue.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) made this proposal to Miss Barrace as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) consciousness of a
special duty had just flickered-up, but that lady's recognition of
Strether's little start at it--as at a betrayal on the speaker's part
of a domesticated state--was as mute as his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) own comment; and after an
instant, when their fellow guest had good-naturedly left them, he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) had
been given something else to think of. <div class="bookquote">``Why has Maria so suddenly
gone? Do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>That was the question Madame de Vionnet had
brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I've no reason to give you but the simple reason I've had
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) in a note--the sudden obligation to join in the south a sick
friend who has got worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has been writing you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not since she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) went--I had only a brief explanatory word before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
started. I went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether explained--<div class="bookquote">``it was the day after
I called on you--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was already on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) way, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) concierge told
me that in case of my coming I was to be informed she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had written to
me. I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) note when I got home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Vionnet listened with interest and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) eyes on
Strether's face; then her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) delicately decorated head had a small
melancholy motion. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) didn't write to ME. I went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``almost immediately after I had seen you, and as I assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) I
would do when I met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) at Gloriani's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hadn't then told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was
to be absent, and I felt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) door as if I understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)'s
absent--with all respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sick friend, though I know indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
has plenty--so that I may not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) doesn't want to meet me
again. Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) continued with a beautiful conscious mildness, <div class="bookquote">``I
liked and admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) beyond every one in the old time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew
it--perhaps that's precisely what has made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) go--and I dare say I
haven't lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) for ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Strether still said nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had a
horror, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now thought of himself, of being in question between
women--was in fact already quite enough on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) way to that, and there
was moreover, as it came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), perceptibly, something behind these
allusions and professions that, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) take it in, would square but
ill with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) present resolve to simplify. It was as if, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), all
the same, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) softness and sadness were sincere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt that not less
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) soon went on: <div class="bookquote">``I'm extremely glad of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) happiness.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But it
also left him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mute--sharp and fine though the imputation it conveyed.
What it conveyed was that HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was Maria Gostrey's happiness, and for the
least little instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had the impulse to challenge the thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
could have done so however only by saying <div class="bookquote">``What then do you suppose to
be between us?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was wonderfully glad a moment later not to have
spoken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would rather seem stupid any day than fatuous, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) drew
back as well, with a smothered inward shudder, from the consideration
of what women--of highly-developed type in particular--might think of
each other. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had come out for he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't come to go into
that; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) absolutely took up nothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interlocutress had now
let drop. Yet, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had kept away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for days, had laid
wholly on herself the burden of their meeting again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't a gleam
of irritation to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well, about Jeanne now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smiled--it
had the gaiety with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had originally come in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt it on the
instant to represent her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) motive and real errand. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been
schooling her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) of a truth to say much in proportion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) little. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you make out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) has a sentiment? I mean for Mr. Newsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Almost resentful, Strether could at last be prompt. <div class="bookquote">``How can I make
out such things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) remained perfectly good-natured. <div class="bookquote">``Ah but they're beautiful little
things, and you make out--don't pretend--everything in the world.
Haven't you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``been talking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but not about Chad. At least not much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you don't require `much'!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) reassuringly declared. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
immediately changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ground. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you remember your promise of
the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To `save' you, as you called it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call it so still. You WILL?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) insisted. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't repented?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``No--but I've been thinking what I meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) kept it up. <div class="bookquote">``And not, a little, what I did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--that's not necessary. It will be enough if I know what I meant
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``by this time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had a pause. <div class="bookquote">``I think you ought to leave it to me. But how
long,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``do you give me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me much more a question of how long you give ME. Doesn't
our friend here himself, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``perpetually make
me present to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether replied, <div class="bookquote">``by ever speaking of you to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) never does that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) considered, and, if the fact was disconcerting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), effectually
concealed it. The next minute indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had recovered. <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
wouldn't. But do you NEED that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) emphasis was wonderful, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes had been wandering he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) longer now. <div class="bookquote">``I see what you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you see what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) triumph was gentle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really had tones to make justice weep.
<div class="bookquote">``I've before me what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) owes you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Admit then that that's something,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said, yet still with the same
discretion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pride.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took in this note but went straight on. <div class="bookquote">``You've made of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) what I
see, but what I don't see is how in the world you've done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah that's another question!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``The point is of what use is
your declining to know me when to know Mr. Newsome--as you do me the
honour to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)--IS just to know me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mused, still with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have met
you to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) raised and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) linked hands. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter. If I
trust you why can't you a little trust me too? And why can't you
also,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked in another tone, <div class="bookquote">``trust yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
no time to reply. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I shall be so easy for you! And I'm glad at any
rate you've seen my child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) does you no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No good?'' (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>--Madame de Vionnet had a clear stare. <div class="bookquote">``Why she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s an angel
of light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's precisely the reason. Leave her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) alone. Don't try to find out.
I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``about what you spoke to me of--the way she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
feels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) companion wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Because one really won't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, because I ask you, as a favour to myself, not to. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s the
most charming creature I've ever seen. Therefore don't touch her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
Don't know--don't want to know. And moreover--yes--you won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was an appeal, of a sudden, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took it in. <div class="bookquote">``As a favour to
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--since you ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything, everything you ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't know
then--never. Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added with peculiar gentleness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
turned away.

<p/>The sound of it lingered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>), making him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) fairly feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had
been tripped up and had a fall. In the very act of arranging with her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) independence he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had, under pressure from a particular
perception, inconsistently, quite stupidly, committed himself, and,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) subtlety sensitive on the spot to an advantage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had driven
in by a single word a little golden nail, the sharp intention of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) signally felt. He (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) hadn't detached, he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) had more closely connected
himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) considered with some intensity this
circumstance, met another pair which had just come within their range
and which struck him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) as reflecting his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) sense of what he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>)
recognised them at the same moment as those of little Bilham, who had
apparently drawn near on purpose to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>), and little Bilham
wasn't, in the conditions, the person to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) heart would be most
closed. They were seated together a minute later at the angle of the
room obliquely opposite the corner in which Gloriani was still engaged
with Jeanne de Vionnet, to whom at first and in silence their attention
had been benevolently given. <div class="bookquote">``I can't see for my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether had
then observed, <div class="bookquote">``how a young fellow of any spirit--such a one as you for
instance--can be admitted to the sight of that young lady without being
hard hit. Why don't you go in, little Bilham?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) remembered the tone
into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been betrayed on the garden-bench at the sculptor's
reception, and this might make up for that by being much more the right
sort of thing to say to a young man worthy of any advice at all. <div class="bookquote">``There
WOULD be some reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some reason for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why for hanging on here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To offer my hand and fortune to Mademoiselle de Vionnet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked, <div class="bookquote">``to what lovelier apparition COULD you offer
them? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s the sweetest little thing I've ever seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s certainly immense. I mean she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s the real thing. I believe the
pale pink petals are folded up there for some wondrous efflorescence in
time; to open, that is, to some great golden sun. I<div class="bookquote">``M unfortunately but
a small farthing candle. What chance in such a field for a poor little
painter-man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you're good enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether threw out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I'm good enough. We're good enough, I consider, nous
autres, for anything. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s TOO good. There's the difference.
They wouldn't look at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, lounging on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) divan and still charmed by the young girl,
whose eyes had consciously strayed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fancied, with a vague
smile--Strether, enjoying the whole occasion as with dormant pulses at
last awake and in spite of new material thrust upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), thought over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's words. <div class="bookquote">``Whom do you mean by `they'? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has a father too, who, whatever else he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
may be, certainly can't be indifferent to the possibilities she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
represents. Besides, there's Chad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether was silent a little. <div class="bookquote">``Ah but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) doesn't care for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--not, I
mean, it appears, after all, in the sense I'm speaking of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s NOT in
love with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) best friend; after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s very fond of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) ideas about what can be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's very strange!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether presently remarked with a sighing
sense of fulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very strange indeed. That's just the beauty of it. Isn't it very
much the kind of beauty you had in mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham went on, <div class="bookquote">``when
you were so wonderful and so inspiring to me the other day? Didn't you
adjure me, in accents I shall never forget, to see, while I've a
chance, everything I can?--and REALLY to see, for it must have been
that only you meant. Well, you did me no end of good, and I'm doing my
best. I DO make it out a situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on after a moment. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had the next minute
an inconsequent question. <div class="bookquote">``How comes Chad so mixed up, anyway?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, ah, ah!'' (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>--and little Bilham fell back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) cushions.

<p/>It reminded our friend of Miss Barrace, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) felt again the brush of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) sense of moving in a maze of mystic closed allusions. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) kept
hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) thread. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I understand really; only the general
transformation makes me occasionally gasp. Chad with such a voice in
the settlement of the future of a little countess--no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) declared,
<div class="bookquote">``it takes more time! You say moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) resumed, <div class="bookquote">``that we're
inevitably, people like you and me, out of the running. The curious
fact remains that Chad himself isn't. The situation doesn't make for
it, but in a different one he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could have her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but that's only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s rich and because there's a
possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) being richer. They won't think of anything but a
great name or a great fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'ll have no great fortune on THESE lines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
must stir his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) stumps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham enquired, <div class="bookquote">``what you were saying to Madame de
Vionnet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I don't say much to her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>). Of course, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether continued,
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) can make sacrifices if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham had a pause. <div class="bookquote">``Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)'s not keen for sacrifices; or
thinks, that is, possibly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) has made enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it IS virtuous,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) companion observed with some decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man dropped after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>It kept Strether himself silent a little. <div class="bookquote">``I've made it out for
myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) then went on; <div class="bookquote">``I've really, within the last half-hour, got
hold of it. I understand it in short at last; which at first--when you
originally spoke to me--I didn't. Nor when Chad originally spoke to me
either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>said little Bilham, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think that at that time you believed
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I did; and I believed Chad too. It would have been odious and
unmannerly--as well as quite perverse--if I hadn't. What interest have
you in deceiving me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man cast about. <div class="bookquote">``What interest have I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Chad MIGHT have. But you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, ah, ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham exclaimed.

<p/>It might, on repetition, as a mystification, have irritated our friend
a little, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew, once more, as we have seen, where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) being proof against everything was only another attestation that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
meant to stay there. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't, without my own impression, realise.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a tremendously clever brilliant capable woman, and with an
extraordinary charm on top of it all--the charm we surely all of us
this evening know what to think of. It isn't every clever brilliant
capable woman that has it. In fact it's rare with any woman. So there
you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether proceeded as if not for little Bilham's benefit
alone. <div class="bookquote">``I understand what a relation with such a woman--what such a
high fine friendship--may be. It can't be vulgar or coarse,
anyway--and that's the point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's the point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>said little Bilham. <div class="bookquote">``It can't be vulgar or
coarse. And, bless us and save us, it ISn't! It's, upon my word, the
very finest thing I ever saw in my life, and the most distinguished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, from beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) and leaning back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) leaned,
dropped on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) a momentary look which filled a short interval and of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) took no notice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) only gazed before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) with intent
participation. <div class="bookquote">``Of course what it has done for him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether at all
events presently pursued, <div class="bookquote">``of course what it has done for him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--that is
as to HOW it has so wonderfully worked--isn't a thing I pretend to

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham echoed. <div class="bookquote">``And it's really and truly she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). I

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I don't think anything now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether impatiently broke in: <div class="bookquote">``that

for him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There must have been stuff in him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? Oh yes, there was stuff indeed,
and much more of it than ever showed, I dare say, at home. Still, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man in all fairness developed, <div class="bookquote">``there was room for
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and that's where she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) chance and took it.
That's what strikes me as having been so fine. But of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
wound up, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that they first met somehow and somewhere--I believe in some
American house--and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), without in the least then intending it, made
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) impression. Then with time and opportunity he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and after
THAT she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was as bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether vaguely took it up. <div class="bookquote">``As `bad'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) began, that is, to care--to care very much. Alone, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
horrid position, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) found it, when once she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had started, an interest.
It was, it is, an interest, and it did--it continues to do--a lot for
herself as well. So she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) still cares. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cares in fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>said little
Bilham thoughtfully <div class="bookquote">``more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's theory that it was none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) business was somehow not
damaged by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took this. <div class="bookquote">``More, you mean, than he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>On which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion looked round at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and now for an instant their eyes
met. <div class="bookquote">``More than he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>Little Bilham, for as long, hung fire. <div class="bookquote">``Will you never tell any one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether thought. <div class="bookquote">``Whom should I tell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why I supposed you reported regularly--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To people at home?'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether took him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't tell them
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man at last looked away. <div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) does now care more than
he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether oddly exclaimed.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion immediately met it. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you after all had your
impression of it? That's how you've got hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but I haven't got hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>But it was all little Bilham said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's at any rate none of my business. I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether explained,
<div class="bookquote">``nothing else than getting hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>It appeared, however, to
strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) business to add: <div class="bookquote">``The fact remains nevertheless that
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has saved him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham just waited. <div class="bookquote">``I thought that was what you were to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>But Strether had his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) answer ready. <div class="bookquote">``I'm speaking--in connexion with
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)--of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manners and morals, his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) character and life. I'm speaking
of him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as a person to deal with and talk with and live with--speaking
of him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as a social animal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And isn't it as a social animal that you also want him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; so that it's as if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had saved him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) FOR us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It strikes you accordingly then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man threw out, <div class="bookquote">``as for you
all to save HER?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh for us `all'--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether could but laugh at that. It brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
back, however, to the point he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had really wished to make. <div class="bookquote">``They've
accepted their situation--hard as it is. They're not free--at least
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s not; but they take what's left to them. It's a friendship, of a
beautiful sort; and that's what makes them so strong. They're
straight, they feel; and they keep each other up. It's doubtless she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),
however, who, as you yourself have hinted, feels it most.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham appeared to wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had hinted. <div class="bookquote">``Feels most that
they're straight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, feels that SHE is, and the strength that comes from it. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
keeps HIM up--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) keeps the whole thing up. When people are able to
it's fine. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s wonderful, wonderful, as Miss Barrace says; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>)
is, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) way, too; however, as a mere man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) may sometimes rebel and
not feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) account in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) has simply given him (<font color='blue'><b>Barrace</b></font>) an
immense moral lift, and what that can explain is prodigious. That's why
I speak of it as a situation. It IS one, if there ever was.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And
Strether, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head back and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes on the ceiling, seemed to
lose himself in the vision of it.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion attended deeply. <div class="bookquote">``You state it much better than I
could.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh you see it doesn't concern you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham considered. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you said just now that it doesn't
concern you either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it doesn't a bit as Madame de Vionnet's affair. But as we were
again saying just now, what did I come out for but to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--to remove him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To save him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) by removal; to win him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) over to HIMSELF thinking it best he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
shall take up business--thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) must immediately do therefore
what's necessary to that end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>said little Bilham after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``you HAVE won him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
does think it best. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) has within a day or two again said to me as
much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked, <div class="bookquote">``is why you consider that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) cares less
than she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cares less for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)? Yes, that's one of the reasons.
But other things too have given me the impression. A man, don't you
think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham presently pursued, <div class="bookquote">``CAN'T, in such conditions,
care so much as a woman. It takes different conditions to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
and then perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cares more. Chad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``has his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) possible
future before him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) business future?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--on the contrary; of the other, the future of what you so justly
call their situation. M. de Vionnet may live for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that they can't marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man waited a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Not being able to marry is all they've
with any confidence to look forward to. A woman--a particular
woman--may stand that strain. But can a man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) propounded.

<p/>Strether's answer was as prompt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already, for himself,
worked it out. <div class="bookquote">``Not without a very high ideal of conduct. But that's
just what we're attributing to Chad. And how, for that matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mused, <div class="bookquote">``does his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) going to America diminish the particular strain?
Wouldn't it seem rather to add to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of sight out of mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion laughed. Then more bravely:
<div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't distance lessen the torment?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>But before Strether could
reply, <div class="bookquote">``The thing is, you see, Chad ought to marry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wound up.

<p/>Strether, for a little, appeared to think of it. <div class="bookquote">``If you talk of
torments you don't diminish mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) then broke out. The next moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feet with a question. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) ought to marry whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham rose more slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Well, some one he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) CAN--some
thoroughly nice girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's eyes, as they stood together, turned again to Jeanne. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you mean HER?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend made a sudden strange face. <div class="bookquote">``After being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
mother? No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But isn't it exactly your idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) ISn't in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend once more had a pause. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) isn't at any rate in love
with Jeanne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How CAN he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) be with any other woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh that I admit. But being in love isn't, you know, here'' (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>--little
Bilham spoke in friendly reminder--<div class="bookquote">``thought necessary, in strictness,
for marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what torment--to call a torment--can there ever possibly be with a
woman like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>As if from the interest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) own question Strether
had gone on without hearing. <div class="bookquote">``Is it for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to have turned a man out
so wonderfully, too, only for somebody else?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) appeared to make a
point of this, and little Bilham looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) now. <div class="bookquote">``When it's for
each other that people give things up they don't miss them.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
threw off as with an extravagance of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was conscious: <div class="bookquote">``Let them
face the future together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) indeed. <div class="bookquote">``You mean that after all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shouldn't go back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gives her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be ashamed of himself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>But Strether spoke with a
sound that might have passed for a laugh.





<p/>Volume II

<p/>Book Seventh




<p/>I


<p/>It wasn't the first time Strether had sat alone in the great dim
church--still less was it the first of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) giving himself up, so far as
conditions permitted, to its beneficent action on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nerves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
been to Notre Dame with Waymarsh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been there with Miss Gostrey,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been there with Chad Newsome, and had found the place, even in
company, such a refuge from the obsession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) problem that, with
renewed pressure from that source, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had not unnaturally recurred to a
remedy meeting the case, for the moment, so indirectly, no doubt, but
so relievingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was conscious enough that it was only for the
moment, but good moments--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) could call them good--still had their
value for a man who by this time struck himself as living almost
disgracefully from hand to mouth. Having so well learnt the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had lately made the pilgrimage more than once by himself--had quite
stolen off, taking an unnoticed chance and making no point of speaking
of the adventure when restored to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great friend, for that matter, was still absent, as well as
remarkably silent; even at the end of three weeks Miss Gostrey hadn't
come back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from Mentone, admitting that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must judge
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) grossly inconsequent--perhaps in fact for the time odiously
faithless; but asking for patience, for a deferred sentence, throwing
herself in short on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) generosity. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) could assure him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
life was complicated--more complicated than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have guessed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
had moreover made certain of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--certain of not wholly missing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) return--before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) disappearance. If furthermore she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) didn't burden
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with letters it was frankly because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) sense of the other great
commerce he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to carry on. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself, at the end of a fortnight,
had written twice, to show how his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) generosity could be trusted; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
reminded himself in each case of Mrs. Newsome's epistolary manner at
the times when Mrs. Newsome kept off delicate ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
problem, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked of Waymarsh and Miss Barrace, of little Bilham and
the set over the river, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had again had tea, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was
easy, for convenience, about Chad and Madame de Vionnet and Jeanne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) continued to see them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was decidedly so confirmed a
haunter of Chad's premises and that young man's practical intimacy with
them was so undeniably great; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) reason for not attempting
to render for Miss Gostrey's benefit the impression of these last days.
That would be to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) too much about himself--it being at present
just from himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was trying to escape.

<p/>This small struggle sprang not a little, in its way, from the same
impulse that had now carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) across to Notre Dame; the impulse to
let things be, to give them time to justify themselves or at least to
pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was aware of having no errand in such a place but the desire
not to be, for the hour, in certain other places; a sense of safety, of
simplification, which each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) yielded to it he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) amused himself by
thinking of as a private concession to cowardice. The great church had
no altar for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) worship, no direct voice for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) soul; but it was none
the less soothing even to sanctity; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could feel while there what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) couldn't elsewhere, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was a plain tired man taking the holiday
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had earned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was tired, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wasn't plain--that was the pity
and the trouble of it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was able, however, to drop his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) problem at the
door very much as if it had been the copper piece that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) deposited, on
the threshold, in the receptacle of the inveterate blind beggar. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)
trod the long dim nave, sat in the splendid choir, paused before the
cluttered chapels of the east end, and the mighty monument laid upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) its spell. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) might have been a student under the charm of a
museum--which was exactly what, in a foreign town, in the afternoon of
life, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) would have liked to be free to be. This form of sacrifice did
at any rate for the occasion as well as another; it made him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) quite
sufficiently understand how, within the precinct, for the real refugee,
the things of the world could fall into abeyance. That was the
cowardice, probably--to dodge them, to beg the question, not to deal
with it in the hard outer light; but his (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) own oblivions were too brief,
too vain, to hurt any one but himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) had a vague and fanciful
kindness for certain persons whom he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) met, figures of mystery and
anxiety, and whom, with observation for his (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) pastime, he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) ranked as those
who were fleeing from justice. Justice was outside, in the hard light,
and injustice too; but one was as absent as the other from the air of
the long aisles and the brightness of the many altars.

<p/>Thus it was at all events that, one morning some dozen days after the
dinner in the Boulevard Malesherbes at which Madame de Vionnet had been
present with her (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) was called upon to play his (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) part in an
encounter that deeply stirred his (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) imagination. He (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) had the habit, in
these contemplations, of watching a fellow visitant, here and there,
from a respectable distance, remarking some note of behaviour, of
penitence, of prostration, of the absolved, relieved state; this was
the manner in which his (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) vague tenderness took its course, the degree of
demonstration to which it naturally had to confine itself. It hadn't
indeed so felt its responsibility as when on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) suddenly
measured the suggestive effect of a lady whose supreme stillness, in
the shade of one of the chapels, he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) had two or three times noticed as
he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) made, and made once more, his (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) slow circuit. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wasn't
prostrate--not in any degree bowed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was strangely fixed, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prolonged immobility showed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) passed and paused, as
wholly given up to the need, whatever it was, that had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
there. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only sat and gazed before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) himself often sat; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had placed herself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) never did, within the focus of the
shrine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had lost herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) could easily see, as he (<font color='blue'><b>refugee</b></font>) would only
have liked to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not a wandering alien, keeping back more than
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave, but one of the familiar, the intimate, the fortunate, for
whom these dealings had a method and a meaning. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reminded our
friend--since it was the way of nine tenths of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) current impressions
to act as recalls of things imagined--of some fine firm concentrated
heroine of an old story, something he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had heard, read, something that,
had he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had a hand for drama, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might himself have written, renewing
her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) courage, renewing her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) clearness, in splendidly-protected
meditation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) back, as she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) sat, was turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
impression absolutely required that she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) should be young and
interesting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) head moreover, even in the sacred
shade, with a discernible faith in herself, a kind of implied
conviction of consistency, security, impunity. But what had such a
woman come for if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hadn't come to pray? Strether's reading of such
matters was, it must be owned, confused; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondered if her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
attitude were some congruous fruit of absolution, of <div class="bookquote">``indulgence.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
knew but dimly what indulgence, in such a place, might mean; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had, as with a soft sweep, a vision of how it might indeed add to the
zest of active rites. All this was a good deal to have been denoted by
a mere lurking figure who was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); but, the last thing
before leaving the church, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had the surprise of a still deeper
quickening.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had dropped upon a seat halfway down the nave and, again in the
museum mood, was trying with head thrown back and eyes aloft, to
reconstitute a past, to reduce it in fact to the convenient terms of
Victor Hugo, whom, a few days before, giving the rein for once in a way
to the joy of life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had purchased in seventy bound volumes, a
miracle of cheapness, parted with, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was assured by the shopman, at
the price of the red-and-gold alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) looked, doubtless, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
played his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) eternal nippers over Gothic glooms, sufficiently rapt in
reverence; but what his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) thought had finally bumped against was the
question of where, among packed accumulations, so multiform a wedge
would be able to enter. Were seventy volumes in red-and-gold to be
perhaps what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) should most substantially have to show at Woollett as
the fruit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) mission? It was a possibility that held him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) a
minute--held him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) happened to feel that some one, unnoticed, had
approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) and paused. Turning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) saw that a lady stood there as
for a greeting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) sprang up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) next took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), securely, for
Madame de Vionnet, who appeared to have recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed
near him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way to the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) checked, quickly and gaily, a
certain confusion in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>), came to meet it, turned it back, by an art of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own; the confusion having threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for the
person he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had lately been observing. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the lurking figure of the
dim chapel; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) guessed; but it came to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) in time, luckily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) needn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and that no harm, after
all, had been done. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) herself, for that matter, straightway showing
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt their encounter as the happiest of accidents, had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) a
<div class="bookquote">``You come here too?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that despoiled surprise of every awkwardness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come often,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I love this place, but I'm terrible, in
general, for churches. The old women who live in them all know me; in
fact I'm already myself one of the old women. It's like that, at all
events, that I foresee I shall end.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Looking about for a chair, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) instantly pulled one nearer, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) again to the
sound of an <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I like so much your also being fond--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) confessed the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) feeling, though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left the object
vague; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was struck with the tact, the taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) vagueness,
which simply took for granted in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) a sense of beautiful things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
was conscious of how much it was affected, this sense, by something
subdued and discreet in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had arranged herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
special object and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) morning walk--he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to have come on
foot; the way her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slightly thicker veil was drawn--a mere touch, but
everything; the composed gravity of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress, in which, here and
there, a dull wine-colour seemed to gleam faintly through black; the
charming discretion of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) small compact head; the quiet note, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
sat, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) folded, grey-gloved hands. It was, to Strether's mind, as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own ground, the light honours of which, at an open
gate, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thus easily did him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), while all the vastness and mystery of
the domain stretched off behind. When people were so completely in
possession they could be extraordinarily civil; and our friend had
indeed at this hour a kind of revelation of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heritage. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
romantic for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) far beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could have guessed, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
found his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) small comfort in the conviction that, subtle though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was,
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) impression must remain a secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The thing that, once
more, made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) uneasy for secrets in general was this particular
patience she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could have with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own want of colour; albeit that on the
other hand his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) uneasiness pretty well dropped after he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been for ten
minutes as colourless as possible and at the same time as responsive.

<p/>The moments had already, for that matter, drawn their deepest tinge
from the special interest excited in him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
companion's identity with the person whose attitude before the
glimmering altar had so impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). This attitude fitted admirably
into the stand he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had privately taken about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) connexion with Chad on
the last occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) seeing them together. It helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to stick
fast at the point he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had then reached; it was there he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had resolved
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) WOULD stick, and at no moment since had it seemed as easy to do
so. Unassailably innocent was a relation that could make one of the
parties to it so carry herself. If it wasn't innocent why did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) haunt
the churches?--into which, given the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) made
out, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would never have come to flaunt an insolence of guilt. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
haunted them for continued help, for strength, for peace--sublime
support which, if one were able to look at it so, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found from day to
day. They talked, in low easy tones and with lifted lingering looks,
about the great monument and its history and its beauty--all of which,
Madame de Vionnet professed, came to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) most in the other, the outer
view. <div class="bookquote">``We'll presently, after we go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``walk round it again
if you like. I'm not in a particular hurry, and it will be pleasant to
look at it well with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had spoken of the great romancer and the
great romance, and of what, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) imagination, they had done for the
whole, mentioning to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) moreover the exorbitance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) purchase, the
seventy blazing volumes that were so out of proportion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of proportion to what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to any other plunge.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) spoke how at that
instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was plunging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) mind and was impatient to
get into the air; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) purpose was a purpose to be uttered outside,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had a fear that it might with delay still slip away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) however took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) time; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drew out their quiet gossip as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had wished to profit by their meeting, and this confirmed precisely an
interpretation of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manner, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mystery. While she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rose, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
would have called it, to the question of Victor Hugo, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice itself,
the light low quaver of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deference to the solemnity about them,
seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) words mean something that they didn't mean openly.
Help, strength, peace, a sublime support--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hadn't found so much of
these things as that the amount wouldn't be sensibly greater for any
scrap his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) appearance of faith in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might enable her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to feel in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
hand. Every little, in a long strain, helped, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) happened to
affect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as a firm object she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could hold on by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) wouldn't jerk
himself out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reach. People in difficulties held on by what was
nearest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was perhaps after all not further off than sources of
comfort more abstract. It was as to this he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
had made it up, that is, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a sign. The sign would be
that--though it was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own affair--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) understood; the sign would be
that--though it was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own affair--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was free to clutch. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
took him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) for a firm object--much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) might to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) own sense appear at
times to rock--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) best to BE one.

<p/>The end of it was that half an hour later they were seated together for
an early luncheon at a wonderful, a delightful house of entertainment
on the left bank--a place of pilgrimage for the knowing, they were both
aware, the knowing who came, for its great renown, the homage of
restless days, from the other end of the town. Strether had already
been there three times--first with Miss Gostrey, then with Chad, then
with Chad again and with Waymarsh and little Bilham, all of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had
himself sagaciously entertained; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) pleasure was deep now on
learning that Madame de Vionnet hadn't yet been initiated. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had
said as they strolled round the church, by the river, acting at last on
what, within, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) mind to, <div class="bookquote">``Will you, if you have time,
come to dejeuner with me somewhere? For instance, if you know it, over
there on the other side, which is so easy a walk'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and then had named
the place; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had done this she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) stopped short as for quick
intensity, and yet deep difficulty, of response. She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) took in the
proposal as if it were almost too charming to be true; and there had
perhaps never yet been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) companion so unexpected a moment of
pride--so fine, so odd a case, at any rate, as his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) finding himself thus
able to offer to a person in such universal possession a new, a rare
amusement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had heard of the happy spot, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) in reply
to a further question how in the world he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) to have
been there. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) supposed himself to have supposed that Chad might have
taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) guessed this the next moment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) no small
discomfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, let me explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't go about with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in
public; I never have such chances--not having them otherwise--and it's
just the sort of thing that, as a quiet creature living in my hole, I
adore.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was more than kind of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to have thought of it--though,
frankly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) asked whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had time she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) hadn't a single minute.
That however made no difference--she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)'d throw everything over. Every
duty at home, domestic, maternal, social, awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>); but it was a
case for a high line. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) affairs would go to smash, but hadn't one a
right to one's snatch of scandal when one was prepared to pay? It was
on this pleasant basis of costly disorder, consequently, that they
eventually seated themselves, on either side of a small table, at a
window adjusted to the busy quay and the shining barge-burdened Seine;
where, for an hour, in the matter of letting himself go, of diving
deep, Strether was to feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had touched bottom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to feel many
things on this occasion, and one of the first of them was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
travelled far since that evening in London, before the theatre, when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) dinner with Maria Gostrey, between the pink-shaded candles, had
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as requiring so many explanations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had at that time
gathered them in, the explanations--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had stored them up; but it was
at present as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had either soared above or sunk below them--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
couldn't tell which; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could somehow think of none that didn't seem to
leave the appearance of collapse and cynicism easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) than
lucidity. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wish it to be lucid for others, for any one,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), for the hour, saw reasons enough in the mere way the bright
clean ordered water-side life came in at the open window?--the mere way
Madame de Vionnet, opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) over their intensely white table-linen,
their omelette aux tomates, their bottle of straw-coloured Chablis,
thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) for everything almost with the smile of a child, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
grey eyes moved in and out of their talk, back to the quarter of the
warm spring air, in which early summer had already begun to throb, and
then back again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) face and their human questions.

<p/>Their human questions became many before they had done--many more, as
one after the other came up, than our friend's free fancy had at all
foreseen. The sense he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had had before, the sense he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had had
repeatedly, the sense that the situation was running away with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), had
never been so sharp as now; and all the more that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could perfectly
put his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) finger on the moment it had taken the bit in its teeth. That
accident had definitely occurred, the other evening, after Chad's
dinner; it had occurred, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fully knew, at the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
interposed between this lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) child, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) suffered himself so
to discuss with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a matter closely concerning them that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own
subtlety, marked by its significant <div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>instantly sealed the
occasion in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) favour. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had held off for ten days, but the
situation had continued out of hand in spite of that; the fact that it
was running so fast being indeed just WHY he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had held off. What had
come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the nave of the church was that
holding off could be but a losing game from the instant she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was worked
for not only by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) subtlety, but by the hand of fate itself. If all
the accidents were to fight on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) side--and by the actual showing they
loomed large--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could only give himself up. This was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had done
in privately deciding then and there to propose she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should breakfast
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). What did the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) proposal in fact resemble but the
smash in which a regular runaway properly ends? The smash was their
walk, their dejeuner, their omelette, the Chablis, the place, the view,
their present talk and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) present pleasure in it--to say nothing,
wonder of wonders, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own. To this tune and nothing less,
accordingly, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) surrender made good. It sufficiently lighted up
at least the folly of holding off. Ancient proverbs sounded, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
memory, in the tone of their words and the clink of their glasses, in
the hum of the town and the plash of the river. It WAS clearly better
to suffer as a sheep than as a lamb. One might as well perish by the
sword as by famine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maria's still away?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--that was the first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had found the frankness to be cheerful about it in spite of the
meaning he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to attach to Miss Gostrey's absence, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had gone
on to enquire if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't tremendously miss her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). There were reasons
that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) by no means sure, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) nevertheless answered
<div class="bookquote">``Tremendously'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took in as if it were all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had wished to
prove. Then, <div class="bookquote">``A man in trouble MUST be possessed somehow of a woman,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't come in one way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comes in another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you call me a man in trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah because that's the way you strike me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke ever so gently
and as if with all fear of wounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat partaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
bounty. <div class="bookquote">``AREn't you in trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) felt himself colour at the question, and then hated that--hated to
pass for anything so idiotic as woundable. Woundable by Chad's lady,
in respect to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had come out with such a fund of
indifference--was he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) already at that point? Perversely, none the less,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) pause gave a strange air of truth to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) supposition; and what was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) in fact but disconcerted at having struck her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) just in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
most dreamed of not doing? <div class="bookquote">``I'm not in trouble yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) at last
smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not in trouble now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm always so. But that you sufficiently know.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a
woman who, between courses, could be graceful with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elbows on the
table. It was a posture unknown to Mrs. Newsome, but it was easy for a
femme du monde. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I am `now'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a question you put to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) presently returned, <div class="bookquote">``the night
of Chad's dinner. I didn't answer it then, and it has been very
handsome of you not to have sought an occasion for pressing me about it
since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was instantly all there. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I know what you allude to. I
asked you what you had meant by saying, the day you came to see me,
just before you left me, that you'd save me. And you then said--at our
friend's--that you'd have really to wait to see, for yourself, what you
did mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I asked for time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether. <div class="bookquote">``And it sounds now, as you put
it, like a very ridiculous speech.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) murmured--she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was full of attenuation. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had another
thought. <div class="bookquote">``If it does sound ridiculous why do you deny that you're in
trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah if I were,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``it wouldn't be the trouble of fearing
ridicule. I don't fear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing--now.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like your `now'!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) laughed across at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's precisely that it fully comes to me at present that I've
kept you long enough. I know by this time, at any rate, what I meant
by my speech; and I really knew it the night of Chad's dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why didn't you tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it was difficult at the moment. I had already at that moment
done something for you, in the sense of what I had said the day I went
to see you; but I wasn't then sure of the importance I might represent
this as having.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was all eagerness. <div class="bookquote">``And you're sure now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I see that, practically, I've done for you--had done for you when
you put me your question--all that it's as yet possible to me to do. I
feel now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that it may go further than I thought. What I
did after my visit to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``was to write straight off to
Mrs. Newsome about you, and I'm at last, from one day to the other,
expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) answer. It's this answer that will represent, as I
believe, the consequences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Patient and beautiful was her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) interest. <div class="bookquote">``I see--the consequences of
your speaking for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) waited as if not to hustle him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) acknowledged it by immediately going on. <div class="bookquote">``The question, you
understand, was HOW I should save you. Well, I'm trying it by thus
letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) know that I consider you worth saving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see--I see.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) eagerness broke through.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I thank you enough?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) couldn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) that, however, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) quickly pursued. <div class="bookquote">``You do really, for yourself, consider it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) only answer at first was to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) to the dish that had been
freshly put before them. <div class="bookquote">``I've written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) again since then--I've
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) in no doubt of what I think. I've told her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) all about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Thanks--not so much. ``All about' me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) went on--<div class="bookquote">``yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All it seems to me you've done for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah and you might have added all it seems to ME!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) laughed again,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) knife and fork, as in the cheer of these
assurances. <div class="bookquote">``But you're not sure how she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'ll take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll not pretend I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Voila.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) waited a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd tell me about her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether with a slightly strained smile, <div class="bookquote">``all that need
concern you about her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s really a grand person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Vionnet seemed to demur. <div class="bookquote">``Is that all that need concern me
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>But Strether neglected the question. <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't Chad talked to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother? Yes, a great deal--immensely. But not from your point
of view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>our friend returned, <div class="bookquote">``have said any ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least bit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has given me, like you, the assurance that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s really grand. But her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being really grand is somehow just what
hasn't seemed to simplify our case. Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``is
further from me than to wish to say a word against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); but of course I
feel how little she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can like being told of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) owing me anything. No
woman ever enjoys such an obligation to another woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a proposition Strether couldn't contradict. <div class="bookquote">``And yet what
other way could I have expressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) what I felt? It's what there
was most to say about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean then that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) WILL be good to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's what I'm waiting to see. But I've little doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could comfortably see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) as a happy, a beneficent thought. <div class="bookquote">``Oh then
couldn't that be managed? Wouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come out? Wouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if you
so put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? DID you by any possibility?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) faintly quavered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was prompt. <div class="bookquote">``Not that. It would be, much more, to give an
account of you that--since there's no question of YOUR paying the
visit--I should go home first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It instantly made her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) graver. <div class="bookquote">``And are you thinking of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh all the while, naturally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay with us--stay with us!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) exclaimed on this. <div class="bookquote">``That's your only
way to make sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To make sure of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why that he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) doesn't break up. You didn't come out to do that to him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it depend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether returned after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``on what you
mean by breaking up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you know well enough what I mean!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) silence seemed again for a little to denote an understanding. <div class="bookquote">``You
take for granted remarkable things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do--to the extent that I don't take for granted vulgar ones.
You're perfectly capable of seeing that what you came out for wasn't
really at all to do what you'd now have to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah it's perfectly simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether good-humouredly pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I've
had but one thing to do--to put our case before him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). To put it as it
could only be put here on the spot--by personal pressure. My dear
lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lucidly pursued, <div class="bookquote">``my work, you see, is really done, and my
reasons for staying on even another day are none of the best. Chad's
in possession of our case and professes to do it full justice. What
remains is with himself. I've had my rest, my amusement and
refreshment; I've had, as we say at Woollett, a lovely time. Nothing
in it has been more lovely than this happy meeting with you--in these
fantastic conditions to which you've so delightfully consented. I've a
sense of success. It's what I wanted. My getting all this good is
what Chad has waited for, and I gather that if I'm ready to go he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s the
same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) head with a finer deeper wisdom. <div class="bookquote">``You're not ready. If
you're ready why did you write to Mrs. Newsome in the sense you've
mentioned to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether considered. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't go before I hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). You're too
much afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added.

<p/>It produced between them a long look from which neither shrank. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't think you believe that--believe I've not really reason to fear
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s capable of great generosity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether presently stated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then let her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) trust me a little. That's all I ask. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
recognise in spite of everything what I've done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>our friend replied, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) can't effectually
recognise it without seeing it for herself. Let Chad go over and show
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) what you've done, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) plead with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) there for it and, as
it were, for YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) measured the depth of this suggestion. <div class="bookquote">``Do you give me your word
of honour that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) once has him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) there she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) won't do her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) best to marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) companion, this enquiry, look again a while out at the
view; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) spoke without sharpness. <div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) sees for
herself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had already broken in. <div class="bookquote">``It's when she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) sees for herself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'ll want to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) most.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's attitude, that of due deference to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) said, permitted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to attend for a minute to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) luncheon. <div class="bookquote">``I doubt if that will come
off. It won't be easy to make it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be easy if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) remains there--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'ll remain for the money.
The money appears to be, as a probability, so hideously much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether presently concluded, <div class="bookquote">``nothing COULD really hurt you
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) gave a strange light laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Putting aside what may really hurt
HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) friend looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had thought of that too. <div class="bookquote">``The
question will come up, of course, of the future that you yourself offer
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was leaning back now, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) fully faced him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well, let it come
up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The point is that it's for Chad to make of it what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) can. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) being
proof against marriage will show what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) does make.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) IS proof, yes'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) accepted the proposition. <div class="bookquote">``But for myself,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``the question is what YOU make.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah I make nothing. It's not my affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon. It's just there that, since you've taken it up and
are committed to it, it most intensely becomes yours. You're not
saving me, I take it, for your interest in myself, but for your
interest in our friend. The one's at any rate wholly dependent on the
other. You can't in honour not see me through,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``because
you can't in honour not see HIM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strange and beautiful to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) quiet soft acuteness. The thing
that most moved him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was really that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was so deeply serious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had
none of the portentous forms of it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had never come in contact,
it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), with a force brought to so fine a head. Mrs. Newsome,
goodness knew, was serious; but it was nothing to this. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took it all
in, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw it all together. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mused, <div class="bookquote">``I can't in honour not see
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) face affected him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as with an exquisite light. <div class="bookquote">``You WILL then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At this she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) pushed back her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) chair and was the next moment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) said with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hand held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) across the table
and with no less a meaning in the words than her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) lips had so
particularly given them after Chad's dinner. The golden nail she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had
then driven in pierced a good inch deeper. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>)
himself had only meanwhile done what he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) mind to on the
same occasion. So far as the essence of the matter went he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) had simply
stood fast on the spot on which he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) had then planted his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) feet.



<p/>II


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) received three days after this a communication from America, in the
form of a scrap of blue paper folded and gummed, not reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>)
through his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) bankers, but delivered at his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) hotel by a small boy in
uniform, who, under instructions from the concierge, approached him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) slowly paced the little court. It was the evening hour, but
daylight was long now and Paris more than ever penetrating. The scent
of flowers was in the streets, he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) had the whiff of violets perpetually
in his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) nose; and he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) had attached himself to sounds and suggestions,
vibrations of the air, human and dramatic, he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) imagined, as they were
not in other places, that came out for him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) more and more as the mild
afternoons deepened--a far-off hum, a sharp near click on the asphalt,
a voice calling, replying, somewhere and as full of tone as an actor's
in a play. He (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) was to dine at home, as usual, with Waymarsh--they had
settled to that for thrift and simplicity; and he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) now hung about before
his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) friend came down.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) telegram in the court, standing still a long time where he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>)
had opened it and giving five minutes afterwards to the renewed study
of it. At last, quickly, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) crumpled it up as if to get it out of the
way; in spite of which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) kept it there--still kept it when,
at the end of another turn, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) had dropped into a chair placed near a
small table. Here, with his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) scrap of paper compressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) fist and
further concealed by his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) folding his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) arms tight, he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) sat for some time
in thought, gazed before him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) so straight that Waymarsh appeared and
approached him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) without catching his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) eye. The latter in fact, struck
with his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) appearance, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) hard for a single instant and then,
as if determined to that course by some special vividness in it,
dropped back into the salon de lecture without addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>). But the
pilgrim from Milrose permitted himself still to observe the scene from
behind the clear glass plate of that retreat. Strether ended, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
sat, by a fresh scrutiny of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) compressed missive, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smoothed
out carefully again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) placed it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) table. There it remained
for some minutes, until, at last looking up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw Waymarsh watching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) from within. It was on this that their eyes met--met for a moment
during which neither moved. But Strether then got up, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
telegram more carefully and putting it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) waistcoat pocket.

<p/>A few minutes later the friends were seated together at dinner; but
Strether had meanwhile said nothing about it, and they eventually
parted, after coffee in the court, with nothing said on either side.
Our friend had moreover the consciousness that even less than usual was
on this occasion said between them, so that it was almost as if each
had been waiting for something from the other. Waymarsh had always
more or less the air of sitting at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tent, and silence,
after so many weeks, had come to play its part in their concert. This
note indeed, to Strether's sense, had lately taken a fuller tone, and
it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fancy to-night that they had never quite so drawn it out.
Yet it befell, none the less that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) closed the door to confidence when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion finally asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) if there were anything particular the
matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``more than usual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On the morrow, however, at an early hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found occasion to give an
answer more in consonance with the facts. What was the matter had
continued to be so all the previous evening, the first hours of which,
after dinner, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had devoted to the copious composition of
a letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had quitted Waymarsh for this purpose, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
own resources with less ceremony than their wont, but finally coming
down again with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) letter unconcluded and going forth into the streets
without enquiry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comrade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had taken a long vague walk, and
one o'clock had struck before his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) return and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) re-ascent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) room
by the aid of the glimmering candle-end left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) on the shelf
outside the porter's lodge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had possessed himself, on closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
door, of the numerous loose sheets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) unfinished composition, and
then, without reading them over, had torn them into small pieces. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had thereupon slept--as if it had been in some measure thanks to that
sacrifice--the sleep of the just, and had prolonged his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) rest
considerably beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) custom. Thus it was that when, between nine
and ten, the tap of the knob of a walking-stick sounded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had not yet made himself altogether presentable. Chad Newsome's bright
deep voice determined quickly enough none the less the admission of the
visitor. The little blue paper of the evening before, plainly an
object the more precious for its escape from premature destruction, now
lay on the sill of the open window, smoothed out afresh and kept from
blowing away by the superincumbent weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) watch. Chad, looking
about with careless and competent criticism, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) looked wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
went immediately espied it and permitted himself to fix it for a moment
rather hard. After which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) host. <div class="bookquote">``It has come
then at last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether paused in the act of pinning his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) necktie. <div class="bookquote">``Then you know--?
You've had one too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've had nothing, and I only know what I see. I see that thing
and I guess. Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``it comes as pat as in a play, for I've
precisely turned up this morning--as I would have done yesterday, but
it was impossible--to take you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To take me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether had turned again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Back, at last, as I promised. I'm ready--I've really been ready this
month. I've only been waiting for you--as was perfectly right. But
you're better now; you're safe--I see that for myself; you've got all
your good. You're looking, this morning, as fit as a flea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) glass, finished dressing; consulting that witness
moreover on this last opinion. WAS he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looking preternaturally fit?
There was something in it perhaps for Chad's wonderful eye, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
felt himself for hours rather in pieces. Such a judgement, however,
was after all but a contribution to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) resolve; it testified
unwittingly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wisdom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was still firmer, apparently--since it
shone in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as a light--than he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had flattered himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) firmness
indeed was slightly compromised, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) faced about to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) friend, by
the way this very personage looked--though the case would of course
have been worse hadn't the secret of personal magnificence been at
every hour Chad's unfailing possession. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was in all the
pleasant morning freshness of it--strong and sleek and gay, easy and
fragrant and fathomless, with happy health in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) colour, and pleasant
silver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thick young hair, and the right word for everything on
the lips that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) clear brownness caused to show as red. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had never
struck Strether as personally such a success; it was as if now, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
definite surrender, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had gathered himself vividly together. This,
sharply and rather strangely, was the form in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to be
presented to Woollett. Our friend took him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in again--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was always
taking him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in and yet finding that parts of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) still remained out;
though even thus his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) image showed through a mist of other things. <div class="bookquote">``I've
had a cable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said, <div class="bookquote">``from your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say, my dear man. I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``No--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not well, I'm sorry to have to tell
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``I must have had the instinct of it. All the more
reason then that we should start straight off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had now got together hat, gloves and stick, but Chad had
dropped on the sofa as if to show where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wished to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
kept observing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion's things; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might have been judging how
quickly they could be packed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might even have wished to hint that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'d send his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own servant to assist. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether
enquired, <div class="bookquote">``by `straight off'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh by one of next week's boats. Everything at this season goes out so
light that berths will be easy anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) telegram, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had kept there after
attaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) watch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now offered it to Chad, who, however, with
an odd movement, declined to take it. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks, I'd rather not. Your
correspondence with Mother's your own affair. I'm only WITH you both
on it, whatever it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether, at this, while their eyes met,
slowly folded the missive and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pocket; after which, before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had spoken again, Chad broke fresh ground. <div class="bookquote">``Has Miss Gostrey come
back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>But when Strether presently spoke it wasn't in answer. <div class="bookquote">``It's not, I
gather, that your mother's physically ill; her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) health, on the whole,
this spring, seems to have been better than usual. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s worried,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s anxious, and it appears to have risen within the last few days to
a climax. We've tired out, between us, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) patience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh it isn't YOU!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad generously protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon--it IS me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether was mild and melancholy, but
firm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw it far away and over his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's head. <div class="bookquote">``It's very
particularly me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then all the more reason. Marchons, marchons!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young
man gaily. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) host, however, at this, but continued to stand agaze;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the next thing repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) question of a moment before.
<div class="bookquote">``Has Miss Gostrey come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, two days ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I'm to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>But Strether wouldn't linger now on Miss
Gostrey. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother sends me an ultimatum. If I can't bring you I'm
to leave you; I'm to come at any rate myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but you CAN bring me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sofa, reassuringly
replied.

<p/>Strether had a pause. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I understand you. Why was it
that, more than a month ago, you put it to me so urgently to let Madame
de Vionnet speak for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Why'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad considered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had it at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fingers' ends. <div class="bookquote">``Why
but because I knew how well she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d do it? It was the way to keep you
quiet and, to that extent, do you good. Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) happily and
comfortably explained, <div class="bookquote">``I wanted you really to know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and to get the
impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--and you see the good that HAS done you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``the way she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has spoken for you, all the
same--so far as I've given her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a chance--has only made me feel how much
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wishes to keep you. If you make nothing of that I don't see why
you wanted me to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why my dear man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I make everything of it! How can
you doubt--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt only because you come to me this morning with your signal to
start.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad stared, then gave a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``And isn't my signal to start just
what you've been waiting for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether debated; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) took another turn. <div class="bookquote">``This last month I've been
awaiting, I think, more than anything else, the message I have here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean you've been afraid of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I was doing my business in my own way. And I suppose your
present announcement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on, <div class="bookquote">``isn't merely the result of
your sense of what I've expected. Otherwise you wouldn't have put me
in relation--''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) paused, pulling up.

<p/>At this Chad rose. <div class="bookquote">``Ah HER wanting me not to go has nothing to do with
it! It's only because she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s afraid--afraid of the way that, over there,
I may get caught. But her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) fear's groundless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had met again his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion's sufficiently searching look. <div class="bookquote">``Are you
tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) in reply to this, with a movement of the head, the
strangest slow smile he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had ever had from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It had immediately, on Strether's imagination, so deep and soft an
effect that our friend could only for the moment keep it before him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Never?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad obligingly and serenely repeated.

<p/>It made his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion take several more steps. ``Then YOU<div class="bookquote">``RE not
afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether pulled up again. <div class="bookquote">``Afraid to stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man looked brightly amazed. <div class="bookquote">``You want me now to `stay'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I don't immediately sail the Pococks will immediately come out.
That's what I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``by your mother's ultimatum .''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad showed a still livelier, but not an alarmed interest. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has
turned on Sarah and Jim?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for an instant in the vision. ``Oh and you may be
sure Mamie. THAT<div class="bookquote">``S whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)'s turning on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>This also Chad saw--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) laughed out. <div class="bookquote">``Mamie--to corrupt me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)'s very charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've already more than once told me. I should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Something happy and easy, something above all unconscious, in the way
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said this, brought home again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion the facility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
attitude and the enviability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) state. <div class="bookquote">``See her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) then by all means.
And consider too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on, <div class="bookquote">``that you really give your sister
a lift in letting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) come to you. You give her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a couple of months of
Paris, which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hasn't seen, if I'm not mistaken, since just after she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
was married, and which I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wants but the pretext to visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad listened, but with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own knowledge of the world. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has
had it, the pretext, these several years, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has never taken it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean YOU?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether after an instant enquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--the lone exile. And whom do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I mean ME. I'm her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pretext. That is--for it comes to the same
thing--I'm your mother's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad asked, <div class="bookquote">``doesn't Mother come herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) friend gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a long look. <div class="bookquote">``Should you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) to?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
for the moment said nothing: <div class="bookquote">``It's perfectly open to you to cable for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad continued to think. <div class="bookquote">``Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) come if I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite possibly. But try, and you'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't YOU try?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad after a moment asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I don't want to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad thought. <div class="bookquote">``Don't desire her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) presence here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether faced the question, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) answer was the more emphatic.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't put it off, my dear boy, on ME!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well--I see what you mean. I'm sure you'd behave beautifully but you
DON<div class="bookquote">``T want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). So I won't play you that trick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether declared, <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't call it a trick. You've a
perfect right, and it would be perfectly straight of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
added in a different tone: <div class="bookquote">``You'd have moreover, in the person of
Madame de Vionnet, a very interesting relation prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes, on this proposition, continued to meet, but Chad's pleasant
and bold, never flinched for a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) got up at last and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) said
something with which Strether was struck. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) wouldn't understand
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), but that makes no difference. Madame de Vionnet would like to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'d like to be charming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) believes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) could work
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether thought a moment, affected by this, but finally turning away.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) couldn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're quite sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, risk it if you like!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, who uttered this with serenity, had urged a plea for their
now getting into the air; but the young man still waited. <div class="bookquote">``Have you
sent your answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've done nothing yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you waiting to see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only waiting'' (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>--and Chad, with this, had a smile for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``to see Miss
Gostrey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not even Miss Gostrey. I wasn't waiting to see any one. I had
only waited, till now, to make up my mind--in complete solitude; and,
since I of course absolutely owe you the information, was on the point
of going out with it quite made up. Have therefore a little more
patience with me. Remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on, <div class="bookquote">``that that's what you
originally asked ME to have. I've had it, you see, and you see what
has come of it. Stay on with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad looked grave. <div class="bookquote">``How much longer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, till I make you a sign. I can't myself, you know, at the best,
or at the worst, stay for ever. Let the Pococks come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether
repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it gains you time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--it gains me time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad, as if it still puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), waited a minute. <div class="bookquote">``You don't want to
get back to Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not just yet. I'm not ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad asked in a tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own, <div class="bookquote">``the charm of life over
here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Immensely.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether faced it. <div class="bookquote">``You've helped me so to feel it that
that surely needn't surprise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it doesn't surprise me, and I'm delighted. But what, my dear
man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad went on with conscious queerness, <div class="bookquote">``does it all lead to for
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>The change of position and of relation, for each, was so oddly betrayed
in the question that Chad laughed out as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had uttered
it--which made Strether also laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Well, to my having a certitude
that has been tested--that has passed through the fire. But oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
couldn't help breaking out, <div class="bookquote">``if within my first month here you had been
willing to move with me--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>said Chad, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) broke down as for weight of thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we should have been over there by now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but you wouldn't have had your fun!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have had a month of it; and I'm having now, if you want to
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether continued, <div class="bookquote">``enough to last me for the rest of my days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad looked amused and interested, yet still somewhat in the dark;
partly perhaps because Strether's estimate of fun had required of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
from the first a good deal of elucidation. <div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't do if I left
you--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Left me?'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether remained blank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only for a month or two--time to go and come. Madame de Vionnet,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad smiled, <div class="bookquote">``would look after you in the interval.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To go back by yourself, I remaining here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Again for an instant their
eyes had the question out; after which Strether said: <div class="bookquote">``Grotesque!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I want to see Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad presently returned. <div class="bookquote">``Remember how
long it is since I've seen Mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Long indeed; and that's exactly why I was originally so keen for
moving you. Hadn't you shown us enough how beautifully you could do
without it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad wonderfully, <div class="bookquote">``I'm better now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an easy triumph in it that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) friend laugh out again.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh if you were worse I SHOULD know what to do with you. In that case
I believe I'd have you gagged and strapped down, carried on board
resisting, kicking. How MUCH,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked, <div class="bookquote">``do you want to see
Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?'' (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>--Chad seemed to find it in fact difficult to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why as much as you've made me. I'd give anything to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). And
you've left me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad went on, <div class="bookquote">``in little enough doubt as to how much
SHE wants it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether thought a minute. <div class="bookquote">``Well then if those things are really your
motive catch the French steamer and sail to-morrow. Of course, when it
comes to that, you're absolutely free to do as you choose. From the
moment you can't hold yourself I can only accept your flight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll fly in a minute then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``if you'll stay here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll stay here till the next steamer--then I'll follow you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you call that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad asked, <div class="bookquote">``accepting my flight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--it's the only thing to call it. The only way to keep me
here, accordingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether explained, <div class="bookquote">``is by staying yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad took it in. <div class="bookquote">``All the more that I've really dished you, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dished me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether echoed as inexpressively as possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sends out the Pococks it will be that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't trust
you, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't trust you, that bears upon--well, you know
what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether decided after a moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) did know what, and in
consonance with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``You see then all the more what you owe
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if I do see, how can I pay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By not deserting me. By standing by me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I say--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>But Chad, as they went downstairs, clapped a firm hand,
in the manner of a pledge, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) shoulder. They descended slowly
together and had, in the court of the hotel, some further talk, of
which the upshot was that they presently separated. Chad Newsome
departed, and Strether, left alone, looked about, superficially, for
Waymarsh. But Waymarsh hadn't yet, it appeared, come down, and our
friend finally went forth without sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).



<p/>III


<p/>At four o'clock that afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had still not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
then, as to make up for this, engaged in talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with Miss
Gostrey. Strether had kept away from home all day, given himself up to
the town and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thoughts, wandered and mused, been at once restless
and absorbed--and all with the present climax of a rich little welcome
in the Quartier Marboeuf. <div class="bookquote">``Waymarsh has been, `unbeknown' to me, I'm
convinced'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>--for Miss Gostrey had enquired--<div class="bookquote">``in communication with
Woollett: the consequence of which was, last night, the loudest
possible call for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean a letter to bring you home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No--a cable, which I have at this moment in my pocket: a <div class="bookquote">``Come back by
the first ship.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's hostess, it might have been made out, just escaped changing
colour. Reflexion arrived but in time and established a provisional
serenity. It was perhaps exactly this that enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) to say with
duplicity: <div class="bookquote">``And you're going--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You almost deserve it when you abandon me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) head as if this were not worth taking up. <div class="bookquote">``My absence
has helped you--as I've only to look at you to see. It was my
calculation, and I'm justified. You're not where you were. And the
thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``was for me not to be there either. You can go of
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but I feel to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comfortably declared, <div class="bookquote">``that I shall want you
yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) all in again. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I promise you not again to leave
you, but it will only be to follow you. You've got your momentum and
can toddle alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) intelligently accepted it. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I suppose I can toddle. It's the
sight of that in fact that has upset Waymarsh. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) can bear it--the way
I strike him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) as going--no longer. That's only the climax of his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
original feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) wants me to quit; and he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) must have written to
Woollett that I'm in peril of perdition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah good!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``But is it only your supposition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I make it out--it explains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) denies?--or you haven't asked him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not had time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said; <div class="bookquote">``I made it out but last night,
putting various things together, and I've not been since then face to
face with him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Because you're too disgusted? You can't trust
yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) glasses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nose. <div class="bookquote">``Do I look in a great rage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look divine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``to be angry about. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) has done me on
the contrary a service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) made it out. <div class="bookquote">``By bringing things to a head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How well you understand!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost groaned. <div class="bookquote">``Waymarsh won't in the
least, at any rate, when I have it out with him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), deny or extenuate. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
has acted from the deepest conviction, with the best conscience and
after wakeful nights. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'ll recognise that he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s fully responsible, and
will consider that he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) has been highly successful; so that any
discussion we may have will bring us quite together again--bridge the
dark stream that has kept us so thoroughly apart. We shall have at
last, in the consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) act, something we can definitely talk
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was silent a little. <div class="bookquote">``How wonderfully you take it! But you're
always wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had a pause that matched her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) own; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had, with an adequate
spirit, a complete admission. <div class="bookquote">``It's quite true. I'm extremely
wonderful just now. I dare say in fact I'm quite fantastic, and I
shouldn't be at all surprised if I were mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then tell me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) earnestly pressed. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), however, for the time
answered nothing, only returning the look with which she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) presented herself where it was easier to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What will Mr.
Waymarsh exactly have done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Simply have written a letter. One will have been quite enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
has told them I want looking after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And DO you?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was all interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Immensely. And I shall get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By which you mean you don't budge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't budge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've cabled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I've made Chad do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you decline to come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) declines. We had it out this morning and I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) round.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had come in, before I was down, to tell me he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was ready--ready, I
mean, to return. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) went off, after ten minutes with me, to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
wouldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey followed with intensity. <div class="bookquote">``Then you've STOPPED him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether settled himself afresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``I've stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). That
is for the time. That'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) more vividly--<div class="bookquote">``is where I
am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see, I see. But where's Mr. Newsome? He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``to
go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And sincerely--believing YOU<div class="bookquote">``D be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly, I think; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was amazed to find the hand I had laid
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) over suddenly converted into an engine for keeping
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was an account of the matter Miss Gostrey could weigh. <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
think the conversion sudden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not altogether sure what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) thinks. I'm
not sure of anything that concerns him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), except that the more I've seen
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) the less I've found him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) what I originally expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s
obscure, and that's why I'm waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``But for what in particular?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) cable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) cable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether replied; ``it was to be, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) left me,
according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) own taste. I simply said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>): ``I want to stay, and
the only way for me to do so is for you to.<div class="bookquote">'' That I wanted to stay
seemed to interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) acted on that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey turned it over. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) wants then himself to stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) half wants it. That is he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) half wants to go. My original appeal
has to that extent worked in him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). Nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether pursued, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
won't go. Not, at least, so long as I'm here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion suggested, <div class="bookquote">``stay here always. I wish
you could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means. Still, I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) a little further. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s not in
the least the case I supposed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s quite another case. And it's as
such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) interests me.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>It was almost as if for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own
intelligence that, deliberate and lucid, our friend thus expressed the
matter. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey but desired to help his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lucidity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had however to be
light and tactful. <div class="bookquote">``Up, you mean--a--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm not thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) mother now. I'm thinking of the plan of
which I was the mouthpiece, which, as soon as we met, I put before him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
as persuasively as I knew how, and which was drawn up, as it were, in
complete ignorance of all that, in this last long period, has been
happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). It took no account whatever of the impression I was
here on the spot immediately to begin to receive from him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)--impressions
of which I feel sure I'm far from having had the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey had a smile of the most genial criticism. <div class="bookquote">``So your idea
is--more or less--to stay out of curiosity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call it what you like! I don't care what it's called--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So long as you do stay? Certainly not then. I call it, all the same,
immense fun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria Gostrey declared; <div class="bookquote">``and to see you work it out will
be one of the sensations of my life. It IS clear you can toddle alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) received this tribute without elation. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't be alone when the
Pococks have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) eyebrows went up. <div class="bookquote">``The Pococks are coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, I mean, is what will happen--and happen as quickly as
possible--in consequence of Chad's cable. They'll simply embark. Sarah
will come to speak for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother--with an effect different from MY
muddle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey more gravely wondered. <div class="bookquote">``SHE then will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very possibly--and we shall see. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) must at any rate have the
chance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) may be trusted to do all she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you WANT that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``I want it. I want to play fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had lost for a moment the thread. <div class="bookquote">``If it devolves on the
Pococks why do you stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just to see that I DO play fair--and a little also, no doubt, that
they do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether was luminous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never been. <div class="bookquote">``I came out to
find myself in presence of new facts--facts that have kept striking me
as less and less met by our old reasons. The matter's perfectly
simple. New reasons--reasons as new as the facts themselves--are
wanted; and of this our friends at Woollett--Chad's and mine--were at
the earliest moment definitely notified. If any are producible Mrs.
Pocock will produce them; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'ll bring over the whole collection.
They'll be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added with a pensive smile <div class="bookquote">``a part of the `fun' you
speak of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) was quite in the current now and floating by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">``It's
Mamie--so far as I've had it from you--who'll be their great card.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
then as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) contemplative silence wasn't a denial she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) significantly
added: <div class="bookquote">``I think I'm sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I am!'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--and Strether sprang up, moving about a little as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
eyes followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But it can't be helped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) coming out can't be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) explained after another turn what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) meant. <div class="bookquote">``The only way for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
not to come is for me to go home--as I believe that on the spot I could
prevent it. But the difficulty as to that is that if I do go home--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see, I see'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had easily understood. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Newsome will do the
same, and that's not'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) laughed out now--<div class="bookquote">``to be thought of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had no laugh; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had only a quiet comparatively placid look
that might have shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as proof against ridicule. <div class="bookquote">``Strange, isn't
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had, in the matter that so much interested them, come so far as
this without sounding another name--to which however their present
momentary silence was full of a conscious reference. Strether's
question was a sufficient implication of the weight it had gained with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) during the absence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hostess; and just for that reason a
single gesture from her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) could pass for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as a vivid answer. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
was answered still better when she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said in a moment: <div class="bookquote">``Will Mr. Newsome
introduce his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) sister--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Madame de Vionnet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether spoke the name at last. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be
greatly surprised if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) doesn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) seemed to gaze at the possibility. <div class="bookquote">``You mean you've thought of it
and you're prepared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've thought of it and I'm prepared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>It was to her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) visitor now that she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) applied her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) consideration. <div class="bookquote">``Bon!
You ARE magnificent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) answered after a pause and a little wearily, but still
standing there before her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``well, that's what, just once in all my dull
days, I think I shall like to have been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Two days later he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had news from Chad of a communication from Woollett
in response to their determinant telegram, this missive being addressed
to Chad himself and announcing the immediate departure for France of
Sarah and Jim and Mamie. Strether had meanwhile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own side
cabled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had but delayed that act till after his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) visit to Miss
Gostrey, an interview by which, as so often before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sense
of things cleared up and settled. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) message to Mrs. Newsome, in
answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) own, had consisted of the words: <div class="bookquote">``Judge best to take
another month, but with full appreciation of all re-enforcements.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Newsome</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was writing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was of course always writing; it
was a practice that continued, oddly enough, to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) come nearer than anything else to the consciousness of doing
something: so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) often wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't really, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
recent stress, acquired some hollow trick, one of the specious arts of
make-believe. Wouldn't the pages he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) still so freely dispatched by the
American post have been worthy of a showy journalist, some master of
the great new science of beating the sense out of words? Wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
writing against time, and mainly to show he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was kind?--since it had
become quite his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) habit not to like to read himself over. On those
lines he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could still be liberal, yet it was at best a sort of whistling
in the dark. It was unmistakeable moreover that the sense of being in
the dark now pressed on him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) more sharply--creating thereby the need for
a louder and livelier whistle. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) whistled long and hard after sending
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) message; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) whistled again and again in celebration of Chad's news;
there was an interval of a fortnight in which this exercise helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had no great notion of what, on the spot, Sarah Pocock would have to
say, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had indeed confused premonitions; but it shouldn't be in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) power to say--it shouldn't be in any one's anywhere to say--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
was neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might have written before more freely,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had never written more copiously; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) frankly gave for a
reason at Woollett that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wished to fill the void created there by
Sarah's departure.

<p/>The increase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) darkness, however, and the quickening, as I have
called it, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) tune, resided in the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was hearing almost
nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had for some time been aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was hearing less than
before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was now clearly following a process by which Mrs.
Newsome's letters could but logically stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't had a line for
many days, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) needed no proof--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was, in time, to have
plenty--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) wouldn't have put pen to paper after receiving the
hint that had determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) telegram. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) wouldn't write till Sarah
should have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) and reported on him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). It was strange, though it
might well be less so than his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own behaviour appeared at Woollett. It
was at any rate significant, and what WAS remarkable was the way his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
friend's nature and manner put on for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), through this very drop of
demonstration, a greater intensity. It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) really that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
never so lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) as during this period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) silence; the
silence was a sacred hush, a finer clearer medium, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
idiosyncrasies showed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) walked about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), drove
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) and dined face-to-face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)--a rare treat <div class="bookquote">``in his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) life,''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could perhaps have scarce escaped phrasing it; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) so soundless he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had never, on the other hand, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
so highly, so almost austerely, herself: pure and by the vulgar
estimate <div class="bookquote">``cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but deep devoted delicate sensitive noble. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
vividness in these respects became for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), in the special conditions,
almost an obsession; and though the obsession sharpened his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) pulses,
adding really to the excitement of life, there were hours at which, to
be less on the stretch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) directly sought forgetfulness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) knew it
for the queerest of adventures--a circumstance capable of playing such
a part only for Lambert Strether--that in Paris itself, of all places,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should find this ghost of the lady of Woollett more importunate than
any other presence.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went back to Maria Gostrey it was for the change to something
else. And yet after all the change scarcely operated for he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) talked to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) of Mrs. Newsome in these days as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never talked before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had hitherto observed in that particular a discretion and a law;
considerations that at present broke down quite as if relations had
altered. They hadn't REALLY altered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said to himself, so much as
that came to; for if what had occurred was of course that Mrs. Newsome
had ceased to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), there was nothing on the other hand to prove
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shouldn't win back her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) confidence. It was quite his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) present
theory that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would leave no stone unturned to do so; and in fact if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now told Maria things about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never told before this
was largely because it kept before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the idea of the honour of such a
woman's esteem. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) relation with Maria as well was, strangely enough,
no longer quite the same; this truth--though not too
disconcertingly--had come up between them on the renewal of their
meetings. It was all contained in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had then almost immediately
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); it was represented by the remark she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had needed but ten
minutes to make and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't been disposed to gainsay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could
toddle alone, and the difference that showed was extraordinary. The
turn taken by their talk had promptly confirmed this difference; his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
larger confidence on the score of Mrs. Newsome did the rest; and the
time seemed already far off when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) small thirsty cup
to the spout of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) pail. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) pail was scarce touched now, and other
fountains had flowed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) fell into her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) place as but one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
tributaries; and there was a strange sweetness--a melancholy mildness
that touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) acceptance of the altered order.

<p/>It marked for himself the flight of time, or at any rate what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was
pleased to think of with irony and pity as the rush of experience; it
having been but the day before yesterday that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) feet and
held on by her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) garment and was fed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hand. It was the proportions
that were changed, and the proportions were at all times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
philosophised, the very conditions of perception, the terms of thought.
It was as if, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) effective little entresol and and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) wide
acquaintance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) activities, varieties, promiscuities, the duties and
devotions that took up nine tenths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) time and of which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) got,
guardedly, but the side-wind--it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had shrunk to a
secondary element and had consented to the shrinkage with the
perfection of tact. This perfection had never failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>); it had
originally been greater than his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) prime measure for it; it had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
quite apart, kept him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) out of the shop, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) huge general
acquaintance, made their commerce as quiet, as much a thing of the home
alone--the opposite of the shop--as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had never another customer.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had been wonderful to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) at first, with the memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) little
entresol, the image to which, on most mornings at that time, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) eyes
directly opened; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) mainly figured for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) as but part of the
bristling total--though of course always as a person to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should
never cease to be indebted. It would never be given to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) certainly
to inspire a greater kindness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had decked him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) out for others, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) saw at this point at least nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) would ever ask for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) only
wondered and questioned and listened, rendering him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) the homage of a
wistful speculation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) expressed it repeatedly; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was already far
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) must prepare herself to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). There was but
one little chance for her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).

<p/>Often as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had said it he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) met it--for it was a touch he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) liked--each
time the same way. <div class="bookquote">``My coming to grief?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--then I might patch you up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh for my real smash, if it takes place, there will be no patching.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you surely don't mean it will kill you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--worse. It will make me old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah nothing can do that! The wonderful and special thing about you is
that you ARE, at this time of day, youth.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) always made,
further, one of those remarks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had completely ceased to adorn
with hesitations or apologies, and that had, by the same token, in
spite of their extreme straightness, ceased to produce in Strether the
least embarrassment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) believe them, and they became
thereby as impersonal as truth itself. <div class="bookquote">``It's just your particular
charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) answer too was always the same. ``Of course I'm youth--youth for
the trip to Europe. I began to be young, or at least to get the
benefit of it, the moment I met you at Chester, and that's what has
been taking place ever since. I never had the benefit at the proper
time--which comes to saying that I never had the thing itself. I'm
having the benefit at this moment; I had it the other day when I said
to Chad <div class="bookquote">``Wait'; I shall have it still again when Sarah Pocock arrives.
It's a benefit that would make a poor show for many people; and I don't
know who else but you and I, frankly, could begin to see in it what I
feel. I don't get drunk; I don't pursue the ladies; I don't spend
money; I don't even write sonnets. But nevertheless I'm making up late
for what I didn't have early. I cultivate my little benefit in my own
little way. It amuses me more than anything that has happened to me in
all my life. They may say what they like--it's my surrender, it's my
tribute, to youth. One puts that in where one can--it has to come in
somewhere, if only out of the lives, the conditions, the feelings of
other persons. Chad gives me the sense of it, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) grey hairs,
which merely make it solid in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) and safe and serene; and SHE does the
same, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) being older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), for all her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) marriageable
daughter, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) separated husband, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) agitated history. Though they're
young enough, my pair, I don't say they're, in the freshest way, their
own absolutely prime adolescence; for that has nothing to do with it.
The point is that they're mine. Yes, they're my youth; since somehow
at the right time nothing else ever was. What I meant just now
therefore is that it would all go--go before doing its work--if they
were to fail me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>On which, just here, Miss Gostrey inveterately questioned. <div class="bookquote">``What do
you, in particular, call its work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to see me through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But through what?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) liked to get it all out of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why through this experience.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That was all that would come.

<p/>It regularly gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) none the less the last word. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember
how in those first days of our meeting it was I who was to see you
through?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember? Tenderly, deeply'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) always rose to it. <div class="bookquote">``You're just
doing your part in letting me maunder to you thus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah don't speak as if my part were small; since whatever else fails
you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU won't, ever, ever, ever?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thus took her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I beg your
pardon; you necessarily, you inevitably WILL. Your conditions--that's
what I mean--won't allow me anything to do for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let alone--I see what you mean--that I'm drearily dreadfully old. I
AM, but there's a service--possible for you to render--that I know, all
the same, I shall think of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This, in fine, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) would never tell him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You shall hear only
if your smash takes place. As that's really out of the question, I
won't expose myself'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--a point at which, for reasons of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own,
Strether ceased to press.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) came round, for publicity--it was the easiest thing--to the idea
that his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) smash WAS out of the question, and this rendered idle the
discussion of what might follow it. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) attached an added importance,
as the days elapsed, to the arrival of the Pococks; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had even a
shameful sense of waiting for it insincerely and incorrectly. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
accused himself of making believe to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own mind that Sarah's
presence, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) impression, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) judgement would simplify and harmonise,
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) accused himself of being so afraid of what they MIGHT do that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
sought refuge, to beg the whole question, in a vain fury. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had
abundantly seen at home what they were in the habit of doing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
had not at present the smallest ground. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) clearest vision was when
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) made out that what he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) most desired was an account more full and free
of Mrs. Newsome's state of mind than any he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could now expect
from herself; that calculation at least went hand in hand with the
sharp consciousness of wishing to prove to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was not
afraid to look his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) behaviour in the face. If he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was by an inexorable
logic to pay for it he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was literally impatient to know the cost, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
held himself ready to pay in instalments. The first instalment would
be precisely this entertainment of Sarah; as a consequence of which
moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should know vastly better how he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) stood.





<p/>Book Eighth




<p/>I


<p/>Strether rambled alone during these few days, the effect of the
incident of the previous week having been to simplify in a marked
fashion his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mixed relations with Waymarsh. Nothing had passed between
them in reference to Mrs. Newsome's summons but that our friend had
mentioned to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own the departure of the deputation actually at
sea--giving him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thus an opportunity to confess to the occult
intervention he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) imputed to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Waymarsh however in the event
confessed to nothing; and though this falsified in some degree
Strether's forecast the latter amusedly saw in it the same depth of
good conscience out of which the dear man's impertinence had originally
sprung. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was patient with the dear man now and delighted to observe
how unmistakeably he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put on flesh; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own holiday so
successfully large and free that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was full of allowances and
charities in respect to those cabined and confined' his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instinct toward
a spirit so strapped down as Waymarsh's was to walk round it on tiptoe
for fear of waking it up to a sense of losses by this time
irretrievable. It was all very funny he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew, and but the difference,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often said to himself, of tweedledum and tweedledee--an
emancipation so purely comparative that it was like the advance of the
door-mat on the scraper; yet the present crisis was happily to profit
by it and the pilgrim from Milrose to know himself more than ever in
the right.

<p/>Strether felt that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) heard of the approach of the Pococks the
impulse of pity quite sprang up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) beside the impulse of triumph.
That was exactly why Waymarsh had looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with eyes in which the
heat of justice was measured and shaded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had looked very hard, as
if affectionately sorry for the friend--the friend of fifty-five--whose
frivolity had had thus to be recorded; becoming, however, but obscurely
sententious and leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companion to formulate a charge. It was in
this general attitude that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had of late altogether taken refuge; with
the drop of discussion they were solemnly sadly superficial; Strether
recognised in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the mere portentous rumination to which Miss Barrace
had so good-humouredly described herself as assigning a corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
salon. It was quite as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) surreptitious step had been
divined, and it was also as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) missed the chance to explain the
purity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) motive; but this privation of relief should be precisely
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) small penance: it was not amiss for Strether that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should find
himself to that degree uneasy. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been challenged or accused,
rebuked for meddling or otherwise pulled up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would probably have
shown, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own system, all the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) consistency, all the
depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) good faith. Explicit resentment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) course would have
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) take the floor, and the thump of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fist on the table would
have affirmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as consciously incorruptible. Had what now really
prevailed with Strether been but a dread of that thump--a dread of
wincing a little painfully at what it might invidiously demonstrate?
However this might be, at any rate, one of the marks of the crisis was
a visible, a studied lapse, in Waymarsh, of betrayed concern. As if to
make up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comrade for the stroke by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had played providence
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now conspicuously ignored his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) movements, withdrew himself from the
pretension to share them, stiffened up his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sensibility to neglect, and,
clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) large empty hands and swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) large restless foot,
clearly looked to another quarter for justice.

<p/>This made for independence on Strether's part, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had in truth at
no moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stay been so free to go and come. The early summer
brushed the picture over and blurred everything but the near; it made a
vast warm fragrant medium in which the elements floated together on the
best of terms, in which rewards were immediate and reckonings
postponed. Chad was out of town again, for the first time since his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
visitor's first view of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had explained this necessity--without
detail, yet also without embarrassment, the circumstance was one of
those which, in the young man's life, testified to the variety of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ties. Strether wasn't otherwise concerned with it than for its so
testifying--a pleasant multitudinous image in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
took comfort, by the same stroke, in the swing of Chad's pendulum back
from that other swing, the sharp jerk towards Woollett, so stayed by
his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) own hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had the entertainment of thinking that if he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had for
that moment stopped the clock it was to promote the next minute this
still livelier motion. He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) himself did what he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) hadn't done before; he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>)
took two or three times whole days off--irrespective of others, of two
or three taken with Miss Gostrey, two or three taken with little
Bilham: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) went to Chartres and cultivated, before the front of the
cathedral, a general easy beatitude; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) went to Fontainebleau and
imagined himself on the way to Italy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) went to Rouen with a little
handbag and inordinately spent the night.

<p/>One afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) did something quite different; finding himself in the
neighbourhood of a fine old house across the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) passed under the
great arch of its doorway and asked at the porter's lodge for Madame de
Vionnet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had already hovered more than once about that possibility,
been aware of it, in the course of ostensible strolls, as lurking but
round the corner. Only it had perversely happened, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) morning
at Notre Dame, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) consistency, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) considered and intended it,
had come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>); whereby he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had reflected that the encounter in
question had been none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) making; clinging again intensely to the
strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) position, which was precisely that there was nothing in
it for himself. From the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) actively pursued the charming
associate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) adventure, from that moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) position weakened, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was then acting in an interested way. It was only within a few days
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had fixed himself a limit: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) promised himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) consistency
should end with Sarah's arrival. It was arguing correctly to feel the
title to a free hand conferred on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) by this event. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wasn't to
be let alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) should be merely a dupe to act with delicacy. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
wasn't to be trusted he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could at least take his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) ease. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was to be
placed under control he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) gained leave to try what his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) position MIGHT
agreeably give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). An ideal rigour would perhaps postpone the trial
till after the Pococks had shown their spirit; and it was to an ideal
rigour that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had quite promised himself to conform.

<p/>Suddenly, however, on this particular day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt a particular fear
under which everything collapsed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) knew abruptly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was afraid
of himself--and yet not in relation to the effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) sensibilities
of another hour of Madame de Vionnet. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) dreaded was the effect
of a single hour of Sarah Pocock, as to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was visited, in
troubled nights, with fantastic waking dreams. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) loomed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
larger than life; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) increased in volume as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) drew nearer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) so
met his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) eyes that, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) imagination taking, after the first step, all,
and more than all, the strides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) already felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) come down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>),
already burned, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) reprobation, with the blush of guilt, already
consented, by way of penance, to the instant forfeiture of everything.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) saw himself, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) direction, recommitted to Woollett as
juvenile offenders are committed to reformatories. It wasn't of course
that Woollett was really a place of discipline; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) knew in advance
that Sarah's salon at the hotel would be. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) danger, at any rate, in
such moods of alarm, was some concession, on this ground, that would
involve a sharp rupture with the actual; therefore if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) waited to take
leave of that actual he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) might wholly miss his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) chance. It was
represented with supreme vividness by Madame de Vionnet, and that is
why, in a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) waited no longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had seen in a flash that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
must anticipate Mrs. Pocock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was accordingly much disappointed on
now learning from the portress that the lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) quest was not in
Paris. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had gone for some days to the country. There was nothing
in this accident but what was natural; yet it produced for poor
Strether a drop of all confidence. It was suddenly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should
never see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again, and as if moreover he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had brought it on himself by
not having been quite kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>It was the advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) having let his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fancy lose itself for a
little in the gloom that, as by reaction, the prospect began really to
brighten from the moment the deputation from Woollett alighted on the
platform of the station. They had come straight from Havre, having
sailed from New York to that port, and having also, thanks to a happy
voyage, made land with a promptitude that left Chad Newsome, who had
meant to meet them at the dock, belated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had received their
telegram, with the announcement of their immediate further advance,
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was taking the train for Havre, so that nothing had remained
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) but to await them in Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hastily picked up Strether, at
the hotel, for this purpose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) even, with easy pleasantry,
suggested the attendance of Waymarsh as well--Waymarsh, at the moment
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) cab rattled up, being engaged, under Strether's contemplative
range, in a grave perambulation of the familiar court. Waymarsh had
learned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion, who had already had a note, delivered by
hand, from Chad, that the Pococks were due, and had ambiguously,
though, as always, impressively, glowered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) over the circumstance;
carrying himself in a manner in which Strether was now expert enough to
recognise his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) uncertainty, in the premises, as to the best tone. The
only tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) aimed at with confidence was a full tone--which was
necessarily difficult in the absence of a full knowledge. The Pococks
were a quantity as yet unmeasured, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had practically brought
them over, so this witness had to that extent exposed himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
wanted to feel right about it, but could only, at the best, for the
time, feel vague. <div class="bookquote">``I shall look to you, you know, immensely,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>our
friend had said, <div class="bookquote">``to help me with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been quite
conscious of the effect of the remark, and of others of the same sort,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) comrade's sombre sensibility. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had insisted on the fact that
Waymarsh would quite like Mrs. Pocock--one could be certain he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would:
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) about everything, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) would also be with HIM,
and Miss Barrace's nose, in short, would find itself out of joint.

<p/>Strether had woven this web of cheerfulness while they waited in the
court for Chad; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had sat smoking cigarettes to keep himself quiet
while, caged and leonine, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fellow traveller paced and turned before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). Chad Newsome was doubtless to be struck, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) arrived, with
the sharpness of their opposition at this particular hour; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was to
remember, as a part of it, how Waymarsh came with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) and with Strether
to the street and stood there with a face half-wistful and half-rueful.
They talked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), the two others, as they drove, and Strether put
Chad in possession of much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own strained sense of things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
already, a few days before, named to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the wire he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was convinced
their friend had pulled--a confidence that had made on the young man's
part quite hugely for curiosity and diversion. The action of the
matter, moreover, Strether could see, was to penetrate; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw that is,
how Chad judged a system of influence in which Waymarsh had served as a
determinant--an impression just now quickened again; with the whole
bearing of such a fact on the youth's view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) relatives. As it
came up between them that they might now take their friend for a
feature of the control of these latter now sought to be exerted from
Woollett, Strether felt indeed how it would be stamped all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>),
half an hour later for Sarah Pocock's eyes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was as much on
Chad's <div class="bookquote">``side''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>as Waymarsh had probably described him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was letting
himself at present, go; there was no denying it; it might be
desperation, it might be confidence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should offer himself to the
arriving travellers bristling with all the lucidity he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had cultivated.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) repeated to Chad what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been saying in the court to Waymarsh;
how there was no doubt whatever that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sister would find the latter a
kindred spirit, no doubt of the alliance, based on an exchange of
views, that the pair would successfully strike up. They would become
as thick as thieves--which moreover was but a development of what
Strether remembered to have said in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) first discussions with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mate, struck as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had then already been with the elements of
affinity between that personage and Mrs. Newsome herself. <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
one day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had questioned me on your mother, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a
person who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), would rouse in him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), I was sure, a
special enthusiasm; and that hangs together with the conviction we now
feel--this certitude that Mrs. Pocock will take him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) boat. For
it's your mother's own boat that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'s pulling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``Mother's worth fifty of Sally!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A thousand; but when you presently meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>), all the same you'll be
meeting your mother's representative--just as I shall. I feel like the
outgoing ambassador,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``doing honour to his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) appointed
successor.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>A moment after speaking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had just done he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
inadvertently rather cheapened Mrs. Newsome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) son; an impression
audibly reflected, as at first seen, in Chad's prompt protest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
recently rather failed of apprehension of the young man's attitude and
temper--remaining principally conscious of how little worry, at the
worst, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wasted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) studied him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) at this critical hour with renewed
interest. Chad had done exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a fortnight
previous--had accepted without another question his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) plea for delay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
was waiting cheerfully and handsomely, but also inscrutably and with a
slight increase perhaps of the hardness originally involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
acquired high polish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was neither excited nor depressed; was easy
and acute and deliberate--unhurried unflurried unworried, only at most
a little less amused than usual. Strether felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) more than ever a
justification of the extraordinary process of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own absurd
spirit had been the arena; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew as their cab rolled along, knew as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't even yet known, that nothing else than what Chad had done and
had been would have led to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) present showing. They had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>),
these things, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was, and the business hadn't been easy; it had
taken time and trouble, it had cost, above all, a price. The result at
any rate was now to be offered to Sally; which Strether, so far as that
was concerned, was glad to be there to witness. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) in the least
make it out or take it in, the result, or would she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) in the least care
for it if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) did? He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) chin as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked himself by what
name, when challenged--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should be--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could call it
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>). Oh those were determinations she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) must herself arrive at;
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) wanted so much to see, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) see then and welcome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) had
come out in the pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) competence, yet it hummed in Strether's
inner sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) practically wouldn't see.

<p/>That this was moreover what Chad shrewdly suspected was clear from a
word that next dropped from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They're children; they play at
life!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and the exclamation was significant and reassuring. It implied
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't then, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion's sensibility, appeared to give
Mrs. Newsome away; and it facilitated our friend's presently asking him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
if it were his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) idea that Mrs. Pocock and Madame de Vionnet should
become acquainted. Strether was still more sharply struck, hereupon,
with Chad's lucidity. <div class="bookquote">``Why, isn't that exactly--to get a sight of the
company I keep--what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has come out for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I'm afraid it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether unguardedly replied.

<p/>Chad's quick rejoinder lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) precipitation. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you say
you're afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, because I feel a certain responsibility. It's my testimony, I
imagine, that will have been at the bottom of Mrs. Pocock's curiosity.
My letters, as I've supposed you to understand from the beginning, have
spoken freely. I've certainly said my little say about Madame de
Vionnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>All that, for Chad, was beautifully obvious. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you've only
spoken handsomely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never more handsomely of any woman. But it's just that tone--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That tone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``that has fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? I dare say; but I've no
quarrel with you about it. And no more has Madame de Vionnet. Don't
you know by this time how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) likes you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--and Strether had, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) groan, a real pang of melancholy.
<div class="bookquote">``For all I've done for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah you've done a great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad's urbanity fairly shamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was at this moment absolutely
impatient to see the face Sarah Pocock would present to a sort of
thing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) synthetically phrased it to himself, with no adequate
forecast of which, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) admonitions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) would certainly arrive.
<div class="bookquote">``I've done THIS!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, this is all right. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad comfortably remarked,
<div class="bookquote">``to be liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>It gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion a moment's thought. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s sure Mrs. Pocock
WILL--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I say that for you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) likes your liking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>); it's so much, as
it were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad laughed, <div class="bookquote">``to the good. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) doesn't despair of
Sarah either, and is prepared, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) own side, to go all lengths.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the way of appreciation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and of everything else. In the way of general amiability,
hospitality and welcome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s under arms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad laughed again; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s
prepared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether took it in; then as if an echo of Miss Barrace were in the
air: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't begin to know HOW wonderful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a depth in it, to Strether's ear, of confirmed luxury--almost
a kind of unconscious insolence of proprietorship; but the effect of
the glimpse was not at this moment to foster speculation: there was
something so conclusive in so much graceful and generous assurance. It
was in fact a fresh evocation; and the evocation had before many
minutes another consequence. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) oftener now. I
shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) as much as I like--by your leave; which is what I
hitherto haven't done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, but without reproach, <div class="bookquote">``only your own fault. I
tried to bring you together, and SHE, my dear fellow--I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
more charming to any man. But you've got your extraordinary ideas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I DID have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether murmured, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt both how they had
possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) and how they had now lost their authority. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) couldn't
have traced the sequence to the end, but it was all because of Mrs.
Pocock. Mrs. Pocock might be because of Mrs. Newsome, but that was
still to be proved. What came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was the sense of having
stupidly failed to profit where profit would have been precious. It
had been open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to see so much more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had but let the
good days pass. Fierce in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost was the resolve to lose no more
of them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) whimsically reflected, while at Chad's side he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) drew
nearer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) destination, that it was after all Sarah who would have
quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) chance. What her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) visit of inquisition might achieve in
other directions was as yet all obscure--only not obscure that it would
do supremely much to bring two earnest persons together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had but to
listen to Chad at this moment to feel it; for Chad was in the act of
remarking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) that they of course both counted on him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) himself
and the other earnest person--for cheer and support. It was brave to
Strether to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) talk as if the line of wisdom they had struck out
was to make things ravishing to the Pococks. No, if Madame de Vionnet
compassed THAT, compassed the ravishment of the Pococks, Madame de
Vionnet would be prodigious. It would be a beautiful plan if it
succeeded, and it all came to the question of Sarah's being really
bribeable. The precedent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) own case helped Strether perhaps but
little to consider she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) might prove so; it being distinct that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
character would rather make for every possible difference. This idea
of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own bribeability set him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) apart for himself; with the further
mark in fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) case was absolutely proved. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) liked always,
where Lambert Strether was concerned, to know the worst, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
now seemed to know was not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was bribeable, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
been effectually bribed. The only difficulty was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) couldn't
quite have said with what. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had sold himself, but
hadn't somehow got the cash. That, however, was what,
characteristically, WOULD happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). It would naturally be his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
kind of traffic. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thought of these things he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) reminded Chad of
the truth they mustn't lose sight of--the truth that, with all
deference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) susceptibility to new interests, Sarah would have come
out with a high firm definite purpose. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hasn't come out, you know,
to be bamboozled. We may all be ravishing--nothing perhaps can be more
easy for us; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hasn't come out to be ravished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) has come out
just simply to take you home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well, with HER I'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad good-humouredly. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
you'll allow THAT.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And then as for a minute Strether said nothing:
<div class="bookquote">``Or is your idea that when I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) I shan't want to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>As this
question, however, again left his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend silent he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) presently went on:
<div class="bookquote">``My own idea at any rate is that they shall have while they're here the
best sort of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was at this that Strether spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Ah there you are! I think if you
really wanted to go--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad to bring it out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you wouldn't trouble about our good time. You wouldn't care
what sort of a time we have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad could always take in the easiest way in the world any ingenious
suggestion. <div class="bookquote">``I see. But can I help it? I'm too decent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you're too decent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether heavily sighed. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt for the
moment as if it were the preposterous end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mission.

<p/>It ministered for the time to this temporary effect that Chad made no
rejoinder. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) spoke again as they came in sight of the station.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to Miss Gostrey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>As to this Strether was ready. <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But haven't you told me they know about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I've told you your mother knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And won't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) have told Sally?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's one of the things I want to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you find she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) HAS--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will I then, you mean, bring them together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) pleasant promptness: <div class="bookquote">``to show her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) there's
nothing in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I care very much what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may
think there's in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if it represents what Mother thinks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah what DOES your mother think?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was in this some sound of
bewilderment.

<p/>But they were just driving up, and help, of a sort, might after all be
quite at hand. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't that, my dear man, what we're both just going to
make out?''



 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>II


<p/>Strether quitted the station half an hour later in different company.
Chad had taken charge, for the journey to the hotel, of Sarah, Mamie,
the maid and the luggage, all spaciously installed and conveyed; and it
was only after the four had rolled away that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion got into a
cab with Jim. A strange new feeling had come over Strether, in
consequence of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) spirits had risen; it was as if what had
occurred on the alighting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) critics had been something other than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fear, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fear had vet not been of an instant scene of
violence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) impression had been nothing but what was inevitable--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
said that to himself; yet relief and reassurance had softly dropped
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). Nothing could be so odd as to be indebted for these things
to the look of faces and the sound of voices that had been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to
satiety, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might have said, for years; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) now knew, all the
same, how uneasy he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had felt; that was brought home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
present sense of a respite. It had come moreover in the flash of an
eye, it had come in the smile with which Sarah, whom, at the window of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) compartment, they had effusively greeted from the platform, rustled
down to them a moment later, fresh and handsome from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) cool June
progress through the charming land. It was only a sign, but enough:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was going to be gracious and unallusive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was going to play the
larger game--which was still more apparent, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had emerged from
Chad's arms, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) direct greeting to the valued friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) family.

<p/>Strether WAS then as much as ever the valued friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) family, it
was something he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could at all events go on with; and the manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
response to it expressed even for himself how little he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had enjoyed the
prospect of ceasing to figure in that likeness. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had always seen
Sarah gracious--had in fact rarely seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) shy or dry, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) marked
thin-lipped smile, intense without brightness and as prompt to act as
the scrape of a safety-match; the protrusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) rather remarkably
long chin, which in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) case represented invitation and urbanity, and
not, as in most others, pugnacity and defiance; the penetration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
voice to a distance, the general encouragement and approval of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
manner, were all elements with which intercourse had made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) familiar,
but which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) noted today almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had been a new acquaintance.
This first glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had given a brief but vivid accent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
resemblance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) for Mrs. Newsome
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes as the train rolled into the station. It was an
impression that quickly dropped; Mrs. Newsome was much handsomer, and
while Sarah inclined to the massive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother had, at an age, still
the girdle of a maid; also the latter's chin was rather short, than
long, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) smile, by good fortune, much more, oh ever so much more,
mercifully vague. Strether had seen Mrs. Newsome reserved; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
literally heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) silent, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never known her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) unpleasant.
It was the case with Mrs. Pocock that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had known HER unpleasant, even
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never known her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) not affable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had forms of affability
that were in a high degree assertive; nothing for instance had ever
been more striking than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was affable to Jim.

<p/>What had told in any case at the window of the train was her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) high clear
forehead, that forehead which her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) friends, for some reason, always
thought of as a <div class="bookquote">``brow'' (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>; the long reach of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) eyes--it came out at this
juncture in such a manner as to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), oddly enough, also of that
of Waymarsh's; and the unusual gloss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) dark hair, dressed and
hatted, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) mother's refined example, with such an avoidance of
extremes that it was always spoken of at Woollett as <div class="bookquote">``their own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Woollett</b></font>)</div>Though this analogy dropped as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) was on the platform it had
lasted long enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) feel all the advantage, as it were, of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) relief. The woman at home, the woman to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was attached, was
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) just long enough to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) again the measure of the
wretchedness, in fact really of the shame, of their having to recognise
the formation, between them, of a <div class="bookquote">``split.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had taken this measure
in solitude and meditation: but the catastrophe, as Sarah steamed up,
looked for its seconds unprecedentedly dreadful--or proved, more
exactly, altogether unthinkable; so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) finding something free and
familiar to respond to brought with it an instant renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
loyalty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had suddenly sounded the whole depth, had gasped at what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) might have lost.

<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could now, for the quarter of an hour of their detention hover
about the travellers as soothingly as if their direct message to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had lost nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wasn't going to have Sarah write to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother that night that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was in any way altered or strange. There
had been times enough for a month when it had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was
strange, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was altered, in every way; but that was a matter for
himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knew at least whose business it was not; it was not at all
events such a circumstance as Sarah's own unaided lights would help her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
to. Even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had come out to flash those lights more than yet
appeared she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wouldn't make much headway against mere pleasantness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
counted on being able to be merely pleasant to the end, and if only
from incapacity moreover to formulate anything different. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) couldn't
even formulate to himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) being changed and queer; it had taken
place, the process, somewhere deep down; Maria Gostrey had caught
glimpses of it; but how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to fish it up, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) desired, for
Mrs. Pocock? This was then the spirit in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hovered, and with
the easier throb in it much indebted furthermore to the impression of
high and established adequacy as a pretty girl promptly produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
by Mamie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had wondered vaguely--turning over many things in the
fidget of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) thoughts--if Mamie WERE as pretty as Woollett published
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>); as to which issue seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) now again was to be so swept away by
Woollett's opinion that this consequence really let loose for the
imagination an avalanche of others. There were positively five minutes
in which the last word seemed of necessity to abide with a Woollett
represented by a Mamie. This was the sort of truth the place itself
would feel; it would send her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) forth in confidence; it would point to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) with triumph; it would take its stand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) with assurance; it
would be conscious of no requirements she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) didn't meet, of no question
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) couldn't answer.

<p/>Well, it was right, Strether slipped smoothly enough into the
cheerfulness of saying: granted that a community MIGHT be best
represented by a young lady of twenty-two, Mamie perfectly played the
part, played it as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) were used to it, and looked and spoke and
dressed the character. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) mightn't, in the high light
of Paris, a cool full studio-light, becoming yet treacherous, show as
too conscious of these matters; but the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) felt satisfied
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) consciousness was after all empty for its size, rather too
simple than too mixed, and that the kind way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) would be not to
take many things out of it, but to put as many as possible in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) was
robust and conveniently tall; just a trifle too bloodlessly fair
perhaps, but with a pleasant public familiar radiance that affirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
vitality. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) might have been <div class="bookquote">``receiving''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>for Woollett, wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
found herself, and there was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) tone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
motion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) pretty blue eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) pretty perfect teeth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) very
small, too small, nose, that immediately placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>), to the fancy,
between the windows of a hot bright room in which voices were high--up
at that end to which people were brought to be <div class="bookquote">``presented.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>They were
there to congratulate, these images, and Strether's renewed vision, on
this hint, completed the idea. What Mamie was like was the happy
bride, the bride after the church and just before going away. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
wasn't the mere maiden, and yet was only as much married as that
quantity came to. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was in the brilliant acclaimed festal stage.
Well, might it last her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) long!

<p/>Strether rejoiced in these things for Chad, who was all genial
attention to the needs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friends, besides having arranged that his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
servant should reinforce him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); the ladies were certainly pleasant to
see, and Mamie would be at any time and anywhere pleasant to exhibit.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) would look extraordinarily like his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) young wife--the wife of a
honeymoon, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) go about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>); but that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own affair--or
perhaps it was hers; it was at any rate something she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) couldn't help.
Strether remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) come up with Jeanne de Vionnet
in Gloriani's garden, and the fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had had about that--the fancy
obscured now, thickly overlaid with others; the recollection was during
these minutes his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) only note of trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had often, in spite of
himself, wondered if Chad but too probably were not with Jeanne the
object of a still and shaded flame. It was on the cards that the child
MIGHT be tremulously in love, and this conviction now flickered up not
a bit the less for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) disliking to think of it, for its being, in a
complicated situation, a complication the more, and for something
indescribable in Mamie, something at all events straightway lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own mind, something that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) value, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) intensity and
purpose, as the symbol of an opposition. Little Jeanne wasn't really
at all in question--how COULD she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) be?--yet from the moment Miss Pocock
had shaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) skirts on the platform, touched up the immense bows of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) hat and settled properly over her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) shoulder the strap of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
morocco-and-gilt travelling-satchel, from that moment little Jeanne was
opposed.

<p/>It was in the cab with Jim that impressions really crowded on Strether,
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the strangest sense of length of absence from people among
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had lived for years. Having them thus come out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had returned to find them: and the droll promptitude of Jim's
mental reaction threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) own initiation far back into the past.
Whoever might or mightn't be suited by what was going on among them,
Jim, for one, would certainly be: his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) instant recognition--frank and
whimsical--of what the affair was for HIM gave Strether a glow of
pleasure. <div class="bookquote">``I say, you know, this IS about my shape, and if it hadn't
been for YOU--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) broke out as the charming streets met his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
healthy appetite; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wound up, after an expressive nudge, with a
clap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's knee and an <div class="bookquote">``Oh you, you--you ARE doing it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>that was charged with rich meaning. Strether felt in it the intention
of homage, but, with a curiosity otherwise occupied, postponed taking
it up. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was asking himself for the time was how Sarah Pocock,
in the opportunity already given her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>), had judged her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) brother--from whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) himself, as they finally, at the station, separated for their
different conveyances, had had a look into which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could read more
than one message. However Sarah was judging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) brother, Chad's
conclusion about his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sister, and about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) husband's
sister, was at the least on the way not to fail of confidence. Strether
felt the confidence, and that, as the look between them was an
exchange, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself gave back was relatively vague. This
comparison of notes however could wait; everything struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as
depending on the effect produced by Chad. Neither Sarah nor Mamie had
in any way, at the station--where they had had after all ample
time--broken out about it; which, to make up for this, was what our
friend had expected of Jim as soon as they should find themselves
together.

<p/>It was queer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had that noiseless brush with Chad; an
ironic intelligence with this youth on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) relatives, an
intelligence carried on under their nose and, as might be said, at
their expense--such a matter marked again for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) strongly the number
of stages he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had come; albeit that if the number seemed great the time
taken for the final one was but the turn of a hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had before this
had many moments of wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) himself weren't perhaps changed
even as Chad was changed. Only what in Chad was conspicuous
improvement--well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had no name ready for the working, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own
organism, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own more timid dose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should have to see first what
this action would amount to. And for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) occult passage with the young
man, after all, the directness of it had no greater oddity than the
fact that the young man's way with the three travellers should have
been so happy a manifestation. Strether liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for it, on the spot,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't yet liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); it affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) while it lasted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might
have been affected by some light pleasant perfect work of art: to that
degree that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondered if they were really worthy of it, took it in
and did it justice; to that degree that it would have been scarce a
miracle if, there in the luggage-room, while they waited for their
things, Sarah had pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sleeve and drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) aside. <div class="bookquote">``You're right;
we haven't quite known what you mean, Mother and I, but now we see.
Chad's magnificent; what can one want more? If THIS is the kind of
thing--!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>On which they might, as it were, have embraced and begun to
work together.

<p/>Ah how much, as it was, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) bridling brightness--which was
merely general and noticed nothing--WOULD they work together? Strether
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was unreasonable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) set it down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) being nervous: people
couldn't notice everything and speak of everything in a quarter of an
hour. Possibly, no doubt, also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) made too much of Chad's display.
Yet, none the less, when, at the end of five minutes, in the cab, Jim
Pocock had said nothing either--hadn't said, that is, what Strether
wanted, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had said much else--it all suddenly bounced back to
their being either stupid or wilful. It was more probably on the whole
the former; so that that would be the drawback of the bridling
brightness. Yes, they would bridle and be bright; they would make the
best of what was before them, but their observation would fail; it
would be beyond them; they simply wouldn't understand. Of what use
would it be then that they had come?--if they weren't to be intelligent
up to THAT point: unless indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) himself were utterly deluded and
extravagant? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), on this question of Chad's improvement, fantastic
and away from the truth? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) live in a false world, a world that
had grown simply to suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and was his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) present slight irritation--in
the face now of Jim's silence in particular--but the alarm of the vain
thing menaced by the touch of the real? Was this contribution of the
real possibly the mission of the Pococks?--had they come to make the
work of observation, as HE (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had practised observation, crack and
crumble, and to reduce Chad to the plain terms in which honest minds
could deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)? Had they come in short to be sane where Strether
was destined to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself had only been silly?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) glanced at such a contingency, but it failed to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) long when
once he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have been silly, in this case, with
Maria Gostrey and little Bilham, with Madame de Vionnet and little
Jeanne, with Lambert Strether, in fine, and above all with Chad Newsome
himself. Wouldn't it be found to have made more for reality to be
silly with these persons than sane with Sarah and Jim? Jim in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
presently made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mind, was individually out of it; Jim didn't
care; Jim hadn't come out either for Chad or for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>); Jim in short left
the moral side to Sally and indeed simply availed himself now, for the
sense of recreation, of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) left almost everything to
Sally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was nothing compared to Sally, and not so much by reason of
Sally's temper and will as by that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) more developed type and
greater acquaintance with the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) quite frankly and serenely
confessed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sat there with Strether, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) type hang
far in the rear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wife's and still further, if possible, in the
rear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sister's. Their types, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) well knew, were recognised and
acclaimed; whereas the most a leading Woollett business-man could hope
to achieve socially, and for that matter industrially, was a certain
freedom to play into this general glamour.

<p/>The impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) made on our friend was another of the things that
marked our friend's road. It was a strange impression, especially as
so soon produced; Strether had received it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) judged, all in the
twenty minutes; it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at least as but in a minor degree the
work of the long Woollett years. Pocock was normally and consentingly
though not quite wittingly out of the question. It was despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
being normal; it was despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) being cheerful; it was despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
being a leading Woollett business-man; and the determination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
fate left him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thus perfectly usual--as everything else about it was
clearly, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sense, not less so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed to say that there was a
whole side of life on which the perfectly usual WAS for leading
Woollett business-men to be out of the question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) made no more of it
than that, and Strether, so far as Jim was concerned, desired to make
no more. Only Strether's imagination, as always, worked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked
himself if this side of life were not somehow connected, for those who
figured on it with the fact of marriage. Would HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) relation to it, had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) married ten years before, have become now the same as Pocock's?
Might it even become the same should he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) marry in a few months? Should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ever know himself as much out of the question for Mrs. Newsome as
Jim knew himself--in a dim way--for Mrs. Jim?

<p/>To turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) eyes in that direction was to be personally reassured; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
was different from Pocock; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had affirmed himself differently and was
held after all in higher esteem. What none the less came home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>),
however, at this hour, was that the society over there, that of which
Sarah and Mamie--and, in a more eminent way, Mrs. Newsome herself--were
specimens, was essentially a society of women, and that poor Jim wasn't
in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) himself Lambert Strether, WAS as yet in some degree--which
was an odd situation for a man; but it kept coming back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a
whimsical way that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should perhaps find his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
place. This occasion indeed, whatever that fancy represented, was not
a time of sensible exclusion for Jim, who was in a state of manifest
response to the charm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) adventure. Small and fat and constantly
facetious, straw-coloured and destitute of marks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would have been
practically indistinguishable hadn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) constant preference for
light-grey clothes, for white hats, for very big cigars and very little
stories, done what it could for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) identity. There were signs in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>),
though none of them plaintive, of always paying for others; and the
principal one perhaps was just this failure of type. It was with this
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) paid, rather than with fatigue or waste; and also doubtless a
little with the effort of humour--never irrelevant to the conditions,
to the relations, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was acquainted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) gurgled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) joy as they rolled through the happy streets; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
declared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) trip was a regular windfall, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wasn't
there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was eager to remark, to hang back from anything: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) didn't
know quite what Sally had come for, but HE (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had come for a good time.
Strether indulged him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) even while wondering if what Sally wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)
brother to go back for was to become like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trusted that
a good time was to be, out and out, the programme for all of them; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) assented liberally to Jim's proposal that, disencumbered and
irresponsible--his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) things were in the omnibus with those of the
others--they should take a further turn round before going to the
hotel. It wasn't for HIM to tackle Chad--it was Sally's job; and as it
would be like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) felt, to open fire on the spot, it wouldn't be
amiss of them to hold off and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) time. Strether, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) side,
only asked to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) time; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) jogged with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion along
boulevards and avenues, trying to extract from meagre material some
forecast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) catastrophe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was quick enough to see that Jim
Pocock declined judgement, had hovered quite round the outer edge of
discussion and anxiety, leaving all analysis of their question to the
ladies alone and now only feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) way toward some small droll
cynicism. It broke out afresh, the cynicism--it had already shown a
flicker--in a but slightly deferred: <div class="bookquote">``Well, hanged if I would if I
were he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean you wouldn't in Chad's place--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give up this to go back and boss the advertising!''  (<font color='red'><b>Poor Jim</b></font>)</div>Poor Jim, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
arms folded and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) little legs out in the open fiacre, drank in the
sparkling Paris noon and carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) eyes from one side of their vista
to the other. <div class="bookquote">``Why I want to come right out and live here myself. And
I want to live while I AM here too. I feel with YOU--oh you've been
grand, old man, and I've twigged--that it ain't right to worry Chad. I
don't mean to persecute him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); I couldn't in conscience. It's thanks to
you at any rate that I'm here, and I'm sure I'm much obliged. You're a
lovely pair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>There were things in this speech that Strether let pass for the time.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you then think it important the advertising should be thoroughly
taken in hand? Chad WILL be, so far as capacity is concerned,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went
on, <div class="bookquote">``the man to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) get his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) capacity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>Jim asked, <div class="bookquote">``over here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't get it over here, and the wonderful thing is that over here
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hasn't inevitably lost it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has a natural turn for business, an
extraordinary head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) comes by that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether explained, <div class="bookquote">``honestly
enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s in that respect his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) father's son, and also--for she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
wonderful in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way too--his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has other tastes and other
tendencies; but Mrs. Newsome and your wife are quite right about his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
having that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s very remarkable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>Jim Pocock comfortably sighed. <div class="bookquote">``But if you've
believed so in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) making us hum, why have you so prolonged the
discussion? Don't you know we've been quite anxious about you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>These questions were not informed with earnestness, but Strether saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
must none the less make a choice and take a line. <div class="bookquote">``Because, you see,
I've greatly liked it. I've liked my Paris, I dare say I've liked it
too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you old wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>Jim gaily exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But nothing's concluded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on. <div class="bookquote">``The case is more complex
than it looks from Woollett.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well, it looks bad enough from Woollett!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>Jim declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even after all I've written?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim bethought himself. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it what you've written that has made
Mrs. Newsome pack us off? That at least and Chad's not turning up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether made a reflexion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``I see. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) should do
something was, no doubt, inevitable, and your wife has therefore of
course come out to act.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>Jim concurred--<div class="bookquote">``to act. But Sally comes out to act, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) lucidly added, <div class="bookquote">``every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) leaves the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) never
comes out but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) DOES act. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s acting moreover now for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) mother,
and that fixes the scale.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wound up, opening all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) senses to
it, with a renewed embrace of pleasant Paris. <div class="bookquote">``We haven't all the same
at Woollett got anything like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether continued to consider. <div class="bookquote">``I'm bound to say for you all that you
strike me as having arrived in a very mild and reasonable frame of
mind. You don't show your claws. I felt just now in Mrs. Pocock no
symptom of that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) isn't fierce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I'm such a nervous
idiot that I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) might be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh don't you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>Pocock asked, <div class="bookquote">``to have noticed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) never gives herself away, any more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) mother ever does?
They ain't fierce, either of 'em; they let you come quite close. They
wear their fur the smooth side out--the warm side in. Do you know what
they are?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>Jim pursued as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), giving the question, as
Strether felt, but half his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) care--<div class="bookquote">``do you know what they are? They're
about as intense as they can live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--and Strether's concurrence had a positive precipitation;
<div class="bookquote">``they're about as intense as they can live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't lash about and shake the cage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>said Jim, who seemed
pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) analogy; <div class="bookquote">``and it's at feeding-time that they're
quietest. But they always get there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do indeed--they always get there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether replied with a laugh
that justified his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) confession of nervousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) disliked to be
talking sincerely of Mrs. Newsome with Pocock; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could have talked
insincerely. But there was something he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted to know, a need created
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) recent intermission, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) having given from the first
so much, as now more than ever appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and got so little. It
was as if a queer truth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's metaphor had rolled over him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
with a rush. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) HAD been quiet at feeding-time; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had fed, and
Sarah had fed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), out of the big bowl of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) recent free
communication, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) vividness and pleasantness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ingenuity and even
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eloquence, while the current of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) response had steadily run thin.
Jim meanwhile however, it was true, slipped characteristically into
shallowness from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ceased to speak out of the experience of
a husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But of course Chad has now the advantage of being there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) doesn't work that for all it's worth--!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) sighed with contingent
pity at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) brother-in-law's possible want of resource. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has worked
it on YOU, pretty well, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) asked the next moment if there were
anything new at the Varieties, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) pronounced in the American
manner. They talked about the Varieties--Strether confessing to a
knowledge which produced again on Pocock's part a play of innuendo as
vague as a nursery-rhyme, yet as aggressive as an elbow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) side;
and they finished their drive under the protection of easy themes.
Strether waited to the end, but still in vain, for any show that Jim
had seen Chad as different; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could scarce have explained the
discouragement he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) drew from the absence of this testimony. It was what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) own stand on, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had taken a stand; and if
they were all only going to see nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had only wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) friend till the very last moment, till they had come into
sight of the hotel; and when poor Pocock only continued cheerful and
envious and funny he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) fairly grew to dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), to feel him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
extravagantly common. If they were ALL going to see
nothing!--Strether knew, as this came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was also
letting Pocock represent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) what Mrs. Newsome wouldn't see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
went on disliking, in the light of Jim's commonness, to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
about that lady; yet just before the cab pulled up he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knew the extent
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) desire for the real word from Woollett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Mrs. Newsome at all given way--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Given way'?'' (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>--Jim echoed it with the practical derision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) sense
of a long past.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Under the strain, I mean, of hope deferred, of disappointment repeated
and thereby intensified.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh is she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) prostrate, you mean?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) categories in hand. <div class="bookquote">``Why
yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s prostrate--just as Sally is. But they're never so lively,
you know, as when they're prostrate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah Sarah's prostrate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether vaguely murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's when they're prostrate that they most sit up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mrs. Newsome's sitting up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All night, my boy--for YOU!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>And Jim fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), with a vulgar
little guffaw, a thrust that gave relief to the picture. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had
got what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) felt on the spot that this WAS the real word
from Woollett. <div class="bookquote">``So don't you go home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Pocock</b></font>)</div>Jim added while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) alighted and
while his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) friend, letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) profusely pay the cabman, sat on in a
momentary muse. Strether wondered if that were the real word too.



<p/>III


<p/>As the door of Mrs. Pocock's salon was pushed open for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), the next
day, well before noon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was reached by a voice with a charming sound
that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) just falter before crossing the threshold. Madame de
Vionnet was already on the field, and this gave the drama a quicker
pace than he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt it as yet--though his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) suspense had increased--in the
power of any act of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) own to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had spent the previous evening
with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) old friends together yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) would still have described
himself as quite in the dark in respect to a forecast of their
influence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) situation. It was strange now, none the less, that in
the light of this unexpected note of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) presence he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt Madame de
Vionnet a part of that situation as she (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) hadn't even yet been. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was
alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) found himself assuming, with Sarah, and there was a bearing
in that--somehow beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) control--on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) personal fate. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was
only saying something quite easy and independent--the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had
come, as a good friend of Chad's, on purpose to say. <div class="bookquote">``There isn't
anything at all--? I should be so delighted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was clear enough, when they were there before him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had been
received. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) saw this, as Sarah got up to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), from something
fairly hectic in Sarah's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) saw furthermore that they weren't,
as had first come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), alone together; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was at no loss as to the
identity of the broad high back presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) in the embrasure of
the window furthest from the door. Waymarsh, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had to-day not yet
seen, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) only knew to have left the hotel before him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and who
had taken part, the night previous, on Mrs. Pocock's kind invitation,
conveyed by Chad, in the entertainment, informal but cordial, promptly
offered by that lady--Waymarsh had anticipated him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) even as Madame de
Vionnet had done, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) attitude
unaffected by Strether's entrance, was looking out, in marked
detachment, at the Rue de Rivoli. The latter felt it in the air--it
was immense how Waymarsh could mark things--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had remained
deeply dissociated from the overture to their hostess that we have
recorded on Madame de Vionnet's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had, conspicuously, tact,
besides a stiff general view; and this was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had left Mrs. Pocock
to struggle alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) would outstay the visitor; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) would
unmistakeably wait; to what had he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) been doomed for months past but
waiting? Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) in reserve. What
support she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) drew from this was still to be seen, for, although Sarah
was vividly bright, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had given herself up for the moment to an
ambiguous flushed formalism. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had had to reckon more quickly than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) expected; but it concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) first of all to signify that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was
not to be taken unawares. Strether arrived precisely in time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
showing it. <div class="bookquote">``Oh you're too good; but I don't think I feel quite
helpless. I have my brother--and these American friends. And then you
know I've been to Paris. I KNOW Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sally</b></font>)</div>said Sally Pocock in a tone
that breathed a certain chill on Strether's heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but a woman, in this tiresome place where everything's always
changing, a woman of good will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet threw off, <div class="bookquote">``can
always help a woman. I'm sure you `know'--but we know perhaps
different things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) too, visibly, wished to make no mistake; but it
was a fear of a different order and more kept out of sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) smiled
in welcome at Strether; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) more familiarly than Mrs.
Pocock; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) without moving from her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) place; and
it came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) in the course of a minute and in the oddest way
that--yes, positively--she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) over to ruin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was all
kindness and ease, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) couldn't help so giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was
exquisite, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) being just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was poured for Sarah a sudden rush
of meaning into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) own equivocations. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was
hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) wanted to show as simple and humble--in the degree
compatible with operative charm; but it was just this that seemed to
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as dressed, as arranged, as
prepared infinitely to conciliate--with the very poetry of good taste
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) view of the conditions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) early call. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was ready to
advise about dressmakers and shops; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) held herself wholly at the
disposition of Chad's family. Strether noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) card on the
table--her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) coronet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Comtesse'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--and the imagination was sharp in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) of certain private adjustments in Sarah's mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had never, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
was sure, sat with a <div class="bookquote">``Comtesse''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>before, and such was the specimen of
that class he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been keeping to play on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had crossed the sea
very particularly for a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) read in Madame de Vionnet's
own eyes that this curiosity hadn't been so successfully met as that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) herself wouldn't now have more than ever need of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked
much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had looked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that morning at Notre Dame; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) noted in
fact the suggestive sameness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) discreet and delicate dress. It
seemed to speak--perhaps a little prematurely or too finely--of the
sense in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would help Mrs. Pocock with the shops. The way that
lady took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in, moreover, added depth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) impression of what Miss
Gostrey, by their common wisdom, had escaped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) winced as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw
himself but for that timely prudence ushering in Maria as a guide and
an example. There was however a touch of relief for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
glimpse, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had got it, of Sarah's line. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``knew Paris.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet had, for that matter, lightly taken this up. <div class="bookquote">``Ah
then you've a turn for that, an affinity that belongs to your family.
Your brother, though his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) long experience makes a difference, I admit,
has become one of us in a marvellous way.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) appealed to Strether
in the manner of a woman who could always glide off with smoothness
into another subject. Wasn't HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) struck with the way Mr. Newsome had
made the place his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) own, and hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) been in a position to profit by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) friend's wondrous expertness?

<p/>Strether felt the bravery, at the least, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) presenting herself so
promptly to sound that note, and yet asked himself what other note,
after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) COULD strike from the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) presented herself at
all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) could meet Mrs. Pocock only on the ground of the obvious, and
what feature of Chad's situation was more eminent than the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had created for himself a new set of circumstances? Unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hid
herself altogether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) could show but as one of these, an illustration
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) domiciled and indeed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) confirmed condition. And the
consciousness of all this in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) charming eyes was so clear and fine
that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thus publicly drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) boat she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
such a silent agitation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was not to fail afterwards to denounce as
pusillanimous. <div class="bookquote">``Ah don't be so charming to me!--for it makes us
intimate, and after all what IS between us when I've been so
tremendously on my guard and have seen you but half a dozen times?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
recognised once more the perverse law that so inveterately governed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
poor personal aspects: it would be exactly LIKE the way things always
turned out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should affect Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh as
launched in a relation in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had really never been launched at
all. They were at this very moment--they could only be--attributing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) the full licence of it, and all by the operation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) own tone
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); whereas his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sole licence had been to cling with intensity to
the brink, not to dip so much as a toe into the flood. But the flicker
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fear on this occasion was not, as may be added, to repeat
itself; it sprang up, for its moment, only to die down and then go out
for ever. To meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fellow visitor's invocation and, with Sarah's
brilliant eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), answer, WAS quite sufficiently to step into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
boat. During the rest of the time her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) visit lasted he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) felt himself
proceed to each of the proper offices, successively, for helping to
keep the adventurous skiff afloat. It rocked beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
settled himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) took up an oar and, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was to
have the credit of pulling, pulled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will make it all the pleasanter if it so happens that we DO
meet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet had further observed in reference to Mrs.
Pocock's mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) initiated state; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had immediately added
that, after all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) hostess couldn't be in need with the good offices
of Mr. Strether so close at hand. <div class="bookquote">``It's he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), I gather, who has learnt
to know his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) Paris, and to love it, better than any one ever before in
so short a time; so that between him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) and your brother, when it comes to
the point, how can you possibly want for good guidance? The great
thing, Mr. Strether will show you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``is just to let one's
self go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I've not let myself go very far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether answered, feeling quite
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been called upon to hint to Mrs. Pocock how Parisians
could talk. <div class="bookquote">``I'm only afraid of showing I haven't let myself go far
enough. I've taken a good deal of time, but I must quite have had the
air of not budging from one spot.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at Sarah in a manner that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) might take as engaging, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) made, under Madame de
Vionnet's protection, as it were, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) first personal point. <div class="bookquote">``What has
really happened has been that, all the while, I've done what I came out
for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet it only at first gave Madame de Vionnet a chance immediately to
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``You've renewed acquaintance with your friend--you've
learnt to know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) again.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) spoke with such cheerful helpfulness
that they might, in a common cause, have been calling together and
pledged to mutual aid.

<p/>Waymarsh, at this, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had been in question, straightway turned
from the window. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, Countess--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has renewed acquaintance with
ME, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) HAS, I guess, learnt something about me, though I don't know
how much he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has liked it. It's for Strether himself to say whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
has felt it justifies his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>said the Countess gaily, <div class="bookquote">``are not in the least what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
came out for--is he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really, Strether? and I hadn't you at all in my
mind. I was thinking of Mr. Newsome, of whom we think so much and with
whom, precisely, Mrs. Pocock has given herself the opportunity to take
up threads. What a pleasure for you both!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
eyes on Sarah, bravely continued.

<p/>Mrs. Pocock met her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) handsomely, but Strether quickly saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) meant to
accept no version of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) movements or plans from any other lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
required no patronage and no support, which were but other names for a
false position; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) would show in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) own way what she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) chose to show,
and this she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) expressed with a dry glitter that recalled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a fine
Woollett winter morning. <div class="bookquote">``I've never wanted for opportunities to see
my brother. We've many things to think of at home, and great
responsibilities and occupations, and our home's not an impossible
place. We've plenty of reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>Sarah continued a little piercingly,
<div class="bookquote">``for everything we do'' (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>--and in short she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wouldn't give herself the
least little scrap away. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) added as one who was always bland and
who could afford a concession: <div class="bookquote">``I've come because--well, because we do
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then fortunately!'' (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>--Madame de Vionnet breathed it to the air. Five
minutes later they were on their feet for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) to take leave, standing
together in an affability that had succeeded in surviving a further
exchange of remarks; only with the emphasised appearance on Waymarsh's
part of a tendency to revert, in a ruminating manner and as with an
instinctive or a precautionary lightening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) tread, to an open
window and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) point of vantage. The glazed and gilded room, all red
damask, ormolu, mirrors, clocks, looked south, and the shutters were
bowed upon the summer morning; but the Tuileries garden and what was
beyond it, over which the whole place hung, were things visible through
gaps; so that the far-spreading presence of Paris came up in coolness,
dimness and invitation, in the twinkle of gilt-tipped palings, the
crunch of gravel, the click of hoofs, the crack of whips, things that
suggested some parade of the circus. <div class="bookquote">``I think it probable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Pocock, <div class="bookquote">``that I shall have the opportunity of going to my brother's
I've no doubt it's very pleasant indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) spoke as to Strether, but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) face was turned with an intensity of brightness to Madame de
Vionnet, and there was a moment during which, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) thus fronted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>), our friend expected to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) add: <div class="bookquote">``I'm much obliged to you,
I'm sure, for inviting me there.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) guessed that for five seconds
these words were on the point of coming; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heard them as clearly as if
they had been spoken; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) presently knew they had just failed--knew
it by a glance, quick and fine, from Madame de Vionnet, which told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) too had felt them in the air, but that the point had luckily
not been made in any manner requiring notice. This left her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) free to
reply only to what had been said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That the Boulevard Malesherbes may be common ground for us offers me
the best prospect I see for the pleasure of meeting you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I shall come to see you, since you've been so good'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>: and Mrs.
Pocock looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) invader well in the eyes. The flush in Sarah's
cheeks had by this time settled to a small definite crimson spot that
was not without its own bravery; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) head a good deal up, and
it came to Strether that of the two, at this moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was the one
who most carried out the idea of a Countess. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) quite took in,
however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would really return her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) visitor's civility: she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
wouldn't report again at Woollett without at least so much producible
history as that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want extremely to be able to show you my little daughter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>Madame de
Vionnet went on; <div class="bookquote">``and I should have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) with me if I hadn't
wished first to ask your leave. I was in hopes I should perhaps find
Miss Pocock, of whose being with you I've heard from Mr. Newsome and
whose acquaintance I should so much like my child to make. If I have
the pleasure of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) and you do permit it I shall venture to ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) to be kind to Jeanne. Mr. Strether will tell you'' (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) beautifully
kept it up--<div class="bookquote">``that my poor girl is gentle and good and rather lonely.
They've made friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), ever so happily, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) doesn't, I
believe, think ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). As for Jeanne herself he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) has had the same
success with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) that I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) has had here wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) has turned.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) seemed to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) for permission to say these things, or seemed
rather to take it, softly and happily, with the ease of intimacy, for
granted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had quite the consciousness now that not to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) at
any point more than halfway would be odiously, basely to abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).
Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was WITH her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), and, opposed even in this covert, this semi-safe
fashion to those who were not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt, strangely and confusedly, but
excitedly, inspiringly, how much and how far. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had
positively waited in suspense for something from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) that would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
in deeper, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) might show her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could take it. And what
did in fact come as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) drew out a little her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) farewell served
sufficiently the purpose. <div class="bookquote">``As his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) success is a matter that I'm sure
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)'ll never mention for himself, I feel, you see, the less scruple;
which it's very good of me to say, you know, by the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) added as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) addressed herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``considering how little direct advantage
I've gained from your triumphs with ME. When does one ever see you? I
wait at home and I languish. You'll have rendered me the service, Mrs.
Pocock, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``of giving me one of my much-too-rare
glimpses of this gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly should be sorry to deprive you of anything that seems so
much, as you describe it, your natural due. Mr. Strether and I are
very old friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>Sarah allowed, <div class="bookquote">``but the privilege of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) society
isn't a thing I shall quarrel about with any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet, dear Sarah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) freely broke in, <div class="bookquote">``I feel, when I hear you say
that, that you don't quite do justice to the important truth of the
extent to which--as you're also mine--I'm your natural due. I should
like much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``to see you fight for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>), Mrs. Pocock, on this, with an arrest of speech--with a
certain breathlessness, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) immediately fancied, on the score of a
freedom for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) wasn't quite prepared. It had flared up--for all
the harm he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had intended by it--because, confoundedly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) didn't want
any more to be afraid about her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wanted to be afraid about
Madame de Vionnet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had never, naturally, called her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) anything but
Sarah at home, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had perhaps never quite so markedly
invoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>that was somehow partly because no occasion
had hitherto laid so effective a trap for it. But something admonished
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) now that it was too late--unless indeed it were possibly too early;
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) at any rate shouldn't have pleased Mrs. Pocock the more by
it. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Strether--!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) murmured with vagueness, yet with
sharpness, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) crimson spot burned a trifle brighter and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was
aware that this must be for the present the limit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) response.
Madame de Vionnet had already, however, come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) aid, and Waymarsh,
as if for further participation, moved again back to them. It was true
that the aid rendered by Madame de Vionnet was questionable; it was a
sign that, for all one might confess to with her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>), and for all she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) might
complain of not enjoying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) could still insidiously show how much of
the material of conversation had accumulated between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The real truth is, you know, that you sacrifice one without mercy to
dear old Maria. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) leaves no room in your life for anybody else. Do

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether answered for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Pocock knows about

mean as I am with Maria. He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reserves her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) best hours; keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
consummately to himself; only gives us others the crumbs of the feast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, Countess, I<div class="bookquote">``VE had some of the crumbs,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh observed with
weight and covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) large look; which led her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) to break in
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could go on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Comment donc, he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shares her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) with YOU?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) exclaimed in droll
stupefaction. <div class="bookquote">``Take care you don't have, before you go much further,
rather more of all ces dames than you may know what to do with!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) only continued in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) massive way. <div class="bookquote">``I can post you about the
lady, Mrs. Pocock, so far as you may care to hear. I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) quite
a number of times, and I was practically present when they made
acquaintance. I've kept my eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) right along, but I don't know as
there's any real harm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Harm'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet quickly echoed. <div class="bookquote">``Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'s the dearest and
cleverest of all the clever and dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you run her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) pretty close, Countess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh returned with
spirit; <div class="bookquote">``though there's no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'s pretty well up in things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) way round Europe. Above all there's no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) does love
Strether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but we all do that--we all love Strether: it isn't a merit!''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>their
fellow visitor laughed, keeping to her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) idea with a good conscience at
which our friend was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) marvelled, though he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) trusted also
for it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) exquisitely expressive eyes, to some later light.

<p/>The prime effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) tone, however--and it was a truth which his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own
eyes gave back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) in sad ironic play--could only be to make him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
feel that, to say such things to a man in public, a woman must
practically think of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as ninety years old. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had turned awkwardly,
responsively red, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew, at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mention of Maria Gostrey; Sarah
Pocock's presence--the particular quality of it--had made this
inevitable; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had grown still redder in proportion as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
hated to have shown anything at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt indeed that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
showing much, as, uncomfortably and almost in pain, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) offered up his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
redness to Waymarsh, who, strangely enough, seemed now to be looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with a certain explanatory yearning. Something deep--something
built on their old old relation--passed, in this complexity, between
them; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got the side-wind of a loyalty that stood behind all actual
queer questions. Waymarsh's dry bare humour--as it gave itself to be
taken--gloomed out to demand justice. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if you talk of Miss
Barrace I've MY chance too,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>it appeared stiffly to nod, and it granted
that it was giving him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) away, but struggled to add that it did so only
to save him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). The sombre glow stared it at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) till it fairly sounded
out--<div class="bookquote">``to save you, poor old man, to save you; to save you in spite of
yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Yet it was somehow just this communication that showed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
to himself as more than ever lost. Still another result of it was to
put before him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as never yet that between his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) comrade and the interest
represented by Sarah there was already a basis. Beyond all question
now, yes: Waymarsh had been in occult relation with Mrs. Newsome--out,
out it all came in the very effort of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you're feeling
my hand'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as good as proclaimed it; <div class="bookquote">``but only because this at least
I SHALL have got out of the damned Old World: that I shall have picked
up the pieces into which it has caused you to crumble.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was as if in
short, after an instant, Strether had not only had it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), but had
recognised that so far as this went the instant had cleared the air.
Our friend understood and approved; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had the sense that they wouldn't
otherwise speak of it. This would be all, and it would mark in himself
a kind of intelligent generosity. It was with grim Sarah then--Sarah
grim for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) grace--that Waymarsh had begun at ten o'clock in the
morning to save him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Well--if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) COULD, poor dear man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) big
bleak kindness! The upshot of which crowded perception was that
Strether, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own side, still showed no more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) absolutely had
to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) showed the least possible by saying to Mrs. Pocock after an
interval much briefer than our glance at the picture reflected in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>):
<div class="bookquote">``Oh it's as true as they please!--There's no Miss Gostrey for any one
but me--not the least little peep. I keep her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's very good of you to notify me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>Sarah replied without
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) and thrown for a moment by this discrimination, as the
direction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) eyes showed, upon a dimly desperate little community
with Madame de Vionnet. <div class="bookquote">``But I hope I shan't miss her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Vionnet instantly rallied. <div class="bookquote">``And you know--though it might
occur to one--it isn't in the least that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)'s
really--in a way--extremely good-looking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but extremely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondered at the odd part
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found thus imposed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>).

<p/>It continued to be so by every touch from Madame de Vionnet. <div class="bookquote">``Well, as
I say, you know, I wish you would keep ME a little more to yourself.
Couldn't you name some day for me, some hour--and better soon than
late? I'll be at home whenever it best suits you. There--I can't say
fairer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether thought a moment while Waymarsh and Mrs. Pocock affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
as standing attentive. <div class="bookquote">``I did lately call on you. Last week--while
Chad was out of town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--and I was away, as it happened, too. You choose your moments
well. But don't wait for my next absence, for I shan't make another,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet declared, <div class="bookquote">``while Mrs. Pocock's here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That vow needn't keep you long, fortunately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>Sarah observed with
reasserted suavity. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be at present but a short time in Paris.
I have my plans for other countries. I meet a number of charming
friends'' (<font color='red'><b>these persons</b></font>)</div>--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) voice seemed to caress that description of these
persons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then,''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) visitor cheerfully replied, <div class="bookquote">``all the more reason!
To-morrow, for instance, or next day?''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) continued to Strether.
<div class="bookquote">``Tuesday would do for me beautifully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tuesday then with pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And at half-past five?--or at six?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/>It was ridiculous, but Mrs. Pocock and Waymarsh struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as fairly
waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) answer. It was indeed as if they were arranged,
gathered for a performance, the performance of <div class="bookquote">``Europe''  (<font color='red'><b>confederate</b></font>)</div>by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
confederate and himself. Well, the performance could only go on. <div class="bookquote">``Say
five forty-five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five forty-five--good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>And now at last Madame de Vionnet must leave
them, though it carried, for herself, the performance a little further.
<div class="bookquote">``I DID hope so much also to see Miss Pocock. Mayn't I still?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah hesitated, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) rose equal. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'ll return your visit with
me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'s at present out with Mr. Pocock and my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see--of course Mr. Newsome has everything to show them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) has told
me so much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>). My great desire's to give my daughter the
opportunity of making her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) acquaintance. I'm always on the lookout for
such chances for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). If I didn't bring her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to-day it was only to make
sure first that you'd let me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>After which the charming woman risked a
more intense appeal. <div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't suit you also to mention some near
time, so that we shall be sure not to lose you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) side
waited, for Sarah likewise had, after all, to perform; and it occupied
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to have been thus reminded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had stayed at home--and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
first morning of Paris--while Chad led the others forth. Oh she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was up
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) eyes; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had stayed at home she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had stayed by an
understanding, arrived at the evening before, that Waymarsh would come
and find her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) alone. This was beginning well--for a first day in Paris;
and the thing might be amusing yet. But Madame de Vionnet's
earnestness was meanwhile beautiful. <div class="bookquote">``You may think me indiscreet, but
I've SUCH a desire my Jeanne shall know an American girl of the really
delightful kind. You see I throw myself for it on your charity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>The manner of this speech gave Strether such a sense of depths below it
and behind it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't yet had--ministered in a way that almost
frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) dim divinations of reasons; but if Sarah still,
in spite of it, faltered, this was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had time for a sign of
sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) petitioner. <div class="bookquote">``Let me say then, dear lady, to back
your plea, that Miss Mamie is of the most delightful kind of all--is
charming among the charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Even Waymarsh, though with more to produce on the subject, could get
into motion in time. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Countess, the American girl's a thing that
your country must at least allow ours the privilege to say we CAN show
you. But her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) full beauty is only for those who know how to make use of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>smiled Madame de Vionnet, <div class="bookquote">``that's exactly what I want to do.
I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has much to teach us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div><p/>It was wonderful, but what was scarce less so was that Strether found
himself, by the quick effect of it, moved another way. <div class="bookquote">``Oh that may
be! But don't speak of your own exquisite daughter, you know, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) weren't pure perfection. I at least won't take that from you.
Mademoiselle de Vionnet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) explained, in considerable form, to Mrs.
Pocock, <div class="bookquote">``IS pure perfection. Mademoiselle de Vionnet IS exquisite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/>It had been perhaps a little portentous, but <div class="bookquote">``Ah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>Sarah simply
glittered.

<p/>Waymarsh himself, for that matter, apparently recognised, in respect to
the facts, the need of a larger justice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had with it an
inclination to Sarah. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Jane's strikingly handsome--in the regular
French style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It somehow made both Strether and Madame de Vionnet laugh out, though
at the very moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) caught in Sarah's eyes, as glancing at the
speaker, a vague but unmistakeable <div class="bookquote">``You too?''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>It made Waymarsh in fact
look consciously over her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) head. Madame de Vionnet meanwhile, however,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) point in her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) own way. <div class="bookquote">``I wish indeed I could offer you my
poor child as a dazzling attraction: it would make one's position
simple enough! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'s as good as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) can be, but of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'s
different, and the question is now--in the light of the way things seem
to go--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) isn't after all TOO different: too different I mean from
the splendid type every one is so agreed that your wonderful country
produces. On the other hand of course Mr. Newsome, who knows it so
well, has, as a good friend, dear kind man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, done everything
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can--to keep us from fatal benightedness--for my small shy creature.
Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) wound up after Mrs. Pocock had signified, in a murmur still
a little stiff, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) would speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) own young charge on the
question--<div class="bookquote">``well, we shall sit, my child and I, and wait and wait and
wait for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) last fine turn was for Strether. <div class="bookquote">``Do speak of
us in such a way--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As that something can't but come of it? Oh something SHALL come of
it! I take a great interest!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) further declared; and in proof of it,
the next moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) carriage.





<p/>Book Ninth




<p/>I


<p/><div class="bookquote">``The difficulty is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Strether said to Madame de Vionnet a couple of
days later, <div class="bookquote">``that I can't surprise them into the smallest sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
not being the same old Chad they've been for the last three years
glowering at across the sea. They simply won't give any, and as a
policy, you know--what you call a parti pris, a deep game--that's
positively remarkable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so remarkable that our friend had pulled up before his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hostess
with the vision of it; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) chair at the end of ten
minutes and begun, as a help not to worry, to move about before her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
quite as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) moved before Maria. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) appointment with her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
to the minute and had been intensely impatient, though divided in truth
between the sense of having everything to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) and the sense of
having nothing at all. The short interval had, in the face of their
complication, multiplied his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) impressions--it being meanwhile to be
noted, moreover, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) already frankly, already almost publicly,
viewed the complication as common to them. If Madame de Vionnet, under
Sarah's eyes, had pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) boat, there was by this time no
doubt whatever that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had remained in it and that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had really
most been conscious of for many hours together was the movement of the
vessel itself. They were in it together this moment as they hadn't yet
been, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) hadn't at present uttered the least of the words of alarm
or remonstrance that had died on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) lips at the hotel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had other
things to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had put him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) in a position; so
quickly had his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) position grown to affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as quite excitingly,
altogether richly, inevitable. That the outlook, however--given the
point of exposure--hadn't cleared up half so much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had reckoned
was the first warning she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) arrival. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had
replied with indulgence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was in too great a hurry, and had
remarked soothingly that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) knew how to be patient surely HE (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) might
be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) presence, on the spot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) tone and everything
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), as an aid to that effort; and it was perhaps one of the
proofs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) success with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) seemed so much to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) ease
while they talked. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) why his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
impressions, though multiplied, still baffled him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>), it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had
been familiarly talking for hours. They baffled him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) because
Sarah--well, Sarah was deep, deeper than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had ever yet had a chance
to show herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) didn't say that this was partly the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
opening so straight down, as it were, into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother, and that, given
Mrs. Newsome's profundity, the shaft thus sunk might well have a reach;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wasn't without a resigned apprehension that, at such a rate of
confidence between the two women, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was likely soon to be moved to
show how already, at moments, it had been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) were dealing
directly with Mrs. Newsome. Sarah, to a certainty, would have begun
herself to feel it in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)--and this naturally put it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) power to
torment him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) the more. From the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) COULD be tormented--!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But WHY can you be?'' (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) companion was surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) use of the
word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I'm made so--I think of everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah one must never do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``One must think of as few
things as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``one must pick them out right. But all I mean
is--for I express myself with violence--that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s in a position to
watch me. There's an element of suspense for me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) can see me
wriggle. But my wriggling doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) pursued. <div class="bookquote">``I can bear
it. Besides, I shall wriggle out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The picture at any rate stirred in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) an appreciation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt to
be sincere. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see how a man can be kinder to a woman than you
are to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, kind was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wanted to be; yet even while her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) charming eyes
rested on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) with the truth of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) none the less had his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) humour of
honesty. <div class="bookquote">``When I say suspense I mean, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``suspense
about my own case too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--about your own case too!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It diminished his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) magnanimity, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) only looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) the more tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that I want to talk to you about that.
It's my own little affair, and I mentioned it simply as part of Mrs.
Pocock's advantage.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No, no; though there was a queer present
temptation in it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) suspense was so real that to fidget was a
relief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wouldn't talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) about Mrs. Newsome, wouldn't work off
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) the anxiety produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) by Sarah's calculated omissions of
reference. The effect she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) produced of representing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother had been
produced--and that was just the immense, the uncanny part of
it--without her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) having so much as mentioned that lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had brought
no message, had alluded to no question, had only answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) enquiries
with hopeless limited propriety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had invented a way of meeting
them--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had been a polite perfunctory poor relation, of distant
degree--that made them almost ridiculous in him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) couldn't moreover
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) own side ask much without appearing to publish how he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had lately
lacked news; a circumstance of which it was Sarah's profound policy not
to betray a suspicion. These things, all the same, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wouldn't breathe
to Madame de Vionnet--much as they might make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) walk up and down. And
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) didn't say--as well as what SHE didn't, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had also her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
high decencies--enhanced the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) being there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) at the
end of ten minutes more intimately on the basis of saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
had yet had occasion to be. It ended in fact by being quite beautiful
between them, the number of things they had a manifest consciousness of
not saying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) would have liked to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), critically, to the
subject of Mrs. Pocock, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) so stuck to the line he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt to be the
point of honour and of delicacy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) scarce even asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) what her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
personal impression had been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) knew it, for that matter, without
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) to trouble: that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) wondered how, with such elements,
Sarah could still have no charm, was one of the principal things she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) tongue about. Strether would have been interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
estimate of the elements--indubitably there, some of them, and to be
appraised according to taste--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) denied himself even the luxury of
this diversion. The way Madame de Vionnet affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) to-day was in
itself a kind of demonstration of the happy employment of gifts. How
could a woman think Sarah had charm who struck one as having arrived at
it herself by such different roads? On the other hand of course Sarah
wasn't obliged to have it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt as if somehow Madame de Vionnet
WAS. The great question meanwhile was what Chad thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sister;
which was naturally ushered in by that of Sarah's apprehension of Chad.
THAT they could talk of, and with a freedom purchased by their
discretion in other senses. The difficulty however was that they were
reduced as yet to conjecture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had given them in the day or two as
little of a lead as Sarah, and Madame de Vionnet mentioned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
hadn't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) since his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) sister's arrival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And does that strike you as such an age?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) met it in all honesty. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I won't pretend I don't miss him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).
Sometimes I see him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) every day. Our friendship's like that. Make what
you will of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) whimsically smiled; a little flicker of the kind,
occasional in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), that had more than once moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) to wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
might best make of HER. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s perfectly right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hastened to
add, <div class="bookquote">``and I wouldn't have him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) fail in any way at present for the world.
I'd sooner not see him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) for three months. I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to be beautiful
to them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) fully feels it for himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether turned away under his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) quick perception; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was so odd a
mixture of lucidity and mystery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) fell in at moments with the
theory about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) most cherished, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) seemed at others to blow it
into air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) spoke now as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) art were all an innocence, and then
again as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) innocence were all an art. <div class="bookquote">``Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s giving himself up,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'ll do so to the end. How can he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) but want, now that it's within
reach, his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) full impression?--which is much more important, you know,
than either yours or mine. But he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s just soaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
came back; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s going in conscientiously for a saturation. I'm bound
to say he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) IS very good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) quietly replied, <div class="bookquote">``to whom do you say it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then more
quietly still: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s capable of anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether more than reaffirmed--<div class="bookquote">``Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s excellent. I more and more
like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) insisted, <div class="bookquote">``to see him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) with them;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>though the oddity of this
tone between them grew sharper for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) even while they spoke. It placed
the young man so before them as the result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) interest and the
product of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) genius, acknowledged so her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) part in the phenomenon and
made the phenomenon so rare, that more than ever yet he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) might have been
on the very point of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) for some more detailed account of the
whole business than he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had yet received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>). The occasion almost
forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) some question as to how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had managed and as to the
appearance such miracles presented from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) own singularly close place
of survey. The moment in fact however passed, giving way to more
present history, and he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) continued simply to mark his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) appreciation of
the happy truth. <div class="bookquote">``It's a tremendous comfort to feel how one can trust
him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then again while for a little she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said nothing--as if after
all to HER trust there might be a special limit: <div class="bookquote">``I mean for making a
good show to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thoughtfully returned--<div class="bookquote">``but if they shut their eyes to it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether for an instant had his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own thought. <div class="bookquote">``Well perhaps that won't
matter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean because he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) probably--do what they will--won't like them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh `do what they will'--! They won't do much; especially if Sarah
hasn't more--well, more than one has yet made out--to give.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Vionnet weighed it. <div class="bookquote">``Ah she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) has all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) grace!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>It was a
statement over which, for a little, they could look at each other
sufficiently straight, and though it produced no protest from Strether
the effect was somehow as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had treated it as a joke. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) may be
persuasive and caressing with him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) may be eloquent beyond words.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) may get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wound up--<div class="bookquote">``well, as neither you nor I
have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) MAY'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--and now Strether smiled. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) has spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
time each day with Jim. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s still showing Jim round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) visibly wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Then how about Jim?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether took a turn before he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) given you Jim?
Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) before this `done' him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was a little at a loss.
<div class="bookquote">``Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) tell you things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``No'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and their eyes once more gave and took. <div class="bookquote">``Not as
you do. You somehow make me see them--or at least feel them. And I
haven't asked too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">``I've of late wanted so not to
worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah for that, so have I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said with encouraging assent; so that--as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had answered everything--they were briefly sociable on it. It
threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) other thought, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took another turn;
stopping again, however, presently with something of a glow. <div class="bookquote">``You see
Jim's really immense. I think it will be Jim who'll do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--just the other thing. Counteract Sarah's spell.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) showed
now, our friend, how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had worked it out. <div class="bookquote">``Jim's intensely
cynical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear Jim!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet vaguely smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, literally--dear Jim! He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s awful. What HE (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wants, heaven forgive
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), is to help us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was eager--<div class="bookquote">``help ME?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Chad and me in the first place. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) throws you in too,
though without as yet seeing you much. Only, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) does see
you--if you don't mind--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sees you as awful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Awful'?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wanted it all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A regular bad one--though of course of a tremendously superior kind.
Dreadful, delightful, irresistible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah dear Jim! I should like to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). I MUST.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, naturally. But will it do? You may, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether
suggested, <div class="bookquote">``disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was droll and humble about it. <div class="bookquote">``I can but try. But my wickedness
then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``is my recommendation for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your wickedness and the charms with which, in such a degree as yours,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) associates it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) understands, you see, that Chad and I have above
all wanted to have a good time, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) view is simple and sharp.
Nothing will persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)--in the light, that is, of my behaviour--that
I really didn't, quite as much as Chad, come over to have one before it
was too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wouldn't have expected it of me; but men of my age,
at Woollett--and especially the least likely ones--have been noted as
liable to strange outbreaks, belated uncanny clutches at the unusual,
the ideal. It's an effect that a lifetime of Woollett has quite been
observed as having; and I thus give it to you, in Jim's view, for what
it's worth. Now his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mother-in-law,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether continued to
explain, <div class="bookquote">``have, as in honour bound, no patience with such phenomena,

hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Chad's the bigger man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'ll work now, en dessous, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) quiet?''

which, as, taking it in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) seemed, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) recurrent alarm, bravely to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) again one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) indefinite reflexions. <div class="bookquote">``Oh

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) so exhilarated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) demonstration that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could

tribute to the ideal; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) will have done about the same. In Paris
it's in the air--so what can one do less? If there's a point that,
beyond any other, Sarah wants to make, it's that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) didn't come out to
be narrow. We shall feel at least that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) sighed, <div class="bookquote">``the quantity we seem likely to `feel'! But what
becomes, in these conditions, of the girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Mamie--if we're all provided? Ah for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``you
can trust Chad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be, you mean, all right to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) every attention as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has polished off Jim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
wants what Jim can give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)--and what Jim really won't--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) has
had it all, and more than all, from me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wants in short his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) own
personal impression, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'ll get it--strong. But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) has
got it Mamie won't suffer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh Mamie mustn't SUFFER!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Madame de Vionnet soothingly emphasised.

<p/>But Strether could reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't fear. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) has done
with Jim, Jim will fall to me. And then you'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as if in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) saw already; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) still waited. Then
<div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) really quite charming?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had got up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) last words and gathered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hat and gloves.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know; I'm watching. I'm studying the case, as it were--and I
dare say I shall be able to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Is it a case?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I think so. At any rate I shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But haven't you known her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smiled--<div class="bookquote">``but somehow at home she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) wasn't a case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) has
become one since.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) made it out for himself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) has
become one here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So very very soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) measured it, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Not sooner than I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you became one--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very very soon. The day I arrived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) intelligent eyes showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thought of it. <div class="bookquote">``Ah but the day you
arrived you met Maria. Whom has Miss Pocock met?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) paused again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) brought it out. <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) met Chad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--but not for the first time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s an old friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>At which
Strether had a slow amused significant headshake that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) go on:
<div class="bookquote">``You mean that for HER at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s a new person--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) sees him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as
different?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) sees him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how does she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether gave it up. <div class="bookquote">``How can one tell how a deep little girl sees a
deep young man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is every one so deep? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it strikes me deeper than I thought. But wait a little--between us
we'll make it out. You'll judge for that matter yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Vionnet looked for the moment fairly bent on the chance.
<div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) WILL come with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?--I mean Mamie with Mrs. Pocock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) curiosity, if nothing else, will in any case work
that. But leave it all to Chad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>wailed Madame de Vionnet, turning away a little wearily, <div class="bookquote">``the
things I leave to Chad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div><p/>The tone of it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) with a kindness that showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) suspense. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) fell back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) confidence. <div class="bookquote">``Oh
well--trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). Trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) all the way.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had indeed no sooner so
spoken than the queer displacement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) point of view appeared again
to come up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) in the very sound, which drew from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) a short
laugh, immediately checked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) became still more advisory. <div class="bookquote">``When they
do come give them plenty of Miss Jeanne. Let Mamie see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked for a moment as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) placed them face to face. <div class="bookquote">``For Mamie
to hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had another of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) corrective headshakes. <div class="bookquote">``Mamie won't. Trust THEM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) hard, and then as if it were what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) must always
come back to: <div class="bookquote">``It's you I trust. But I was sincere,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``at
the hotel. I did, I do, want my child--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether waited with deference while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) appeared to hesitate
as to how to put it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) can for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether for a little met her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) eyes on it; after which something that
might have been unexpected to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) came from him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Poor little duck!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Not more expected for himself indeed might well have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) echo of
it. <div class="bookquote">``Poor little duck! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) immensely wants herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``to see our friend's cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's what we call the young lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thought again; then with a laugh: <div class="bookquote">``Well, your daughter will help
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>And now at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been intending for five
minutes. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) went part of the way with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) out
of the room and into the next and the next. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) noble old apartment
offered a succession of three, the first two of which indeed, on
entering, smaller than the last, but each with its faded and formal
air, enlarged the office of the antechamber and enriched the sense of
approach. Strether fancied them, liked them, and, passing through them
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) more slowly now, met a sharp renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) original
impression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked back; the whole thing made a vista,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found high melancholy and sweet--full, once more, of dim
historic shades, of the faint faraway cannon-roar of the great Empire.
It was doubtless half the projection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mind, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mind was a
thing that, among old waxed parquets, pale shades of pink and green,
pseudo-classic candelabra, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had always needfully to reckon with. They
could easily make him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) irrelevant. The oddity, the originality, the
poetry--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't know what to call it--of Chad's connexion reaffirmed
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) its romantic side. <div class="bookquote">``They ought to see this, you know. They
MUST.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Pococks?'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked about in deprecation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed to see gaps
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamie and Sarah--Mamie in particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My shabby old place? But THEIR things--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh their things! You were talking of what will do something for you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that it strikes you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) broke in, <div class="bookquote">``that my poor place may? Oh,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ruefully mused, <div class="bookquote">``that WOULD be desperate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what I wish?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I wish Mrs. Newsome herself
could have a look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stared, missing a little his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) logic. <div class="bookquote">``It would make a difference?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) tone was so earnest that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) continued to look about he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``It might!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you've told her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), you tell me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All about you? Yes, a wonderful story. But there's all the
indescribable--what one gets only on the spot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) charmingly and sadly smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all about me here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) freely continued. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Newsome feels
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed doomed always to come back to doubt. <div class="bookquote">``No one feels so
much as YOU. No--not any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the worse then for every one. It's very easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They were by this time in the antechamber, still alone together, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
hadn't rung for a servant. The antechamber was high and square, grave
and suggestive too, a little cold and slippery even in summer, and with
a few old prints that were precious, Strether divined, on the walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
stood in the middle, slightly lingering, vaguely directing his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) glasses,
while, leaning against the door-post of the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gently pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) cheek to the side of the recess. <div class="bookquote">``YOU would have been a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--it startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For the reason you say. You're not stupid.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then abruptly, as if
bringing it out were somehow founded on that fact: <div class="bookquote">``We're marrying
Jeanne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) on the spot as a move in a game, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was even then
not without the sense that that wasn't the way Jeanne should be
married. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) quickly showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interest, though--as quickly
afterwards struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--with an absurd confusion of mind. <div class="bookquote">''`You'? You
and--a--not Chad?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Of course it was the child's father who made the
<div class="bookquote">``we,''  (<font color='red'><b>child father</b></font>)</div>but to the child's father it would have cost him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) an effort to
allude. Yet didn't it seem the next minute that Monsieur de Vionnet
was after all not in question?--since she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had gone on to say that it
was indeed to Chad she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) referred and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been in the whole
matter kindness itself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I must tell you all, it is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) himself who has put us in the way. I
mean in the way of an opportunity that, so far as I can yet see, is all
I could possibly have dreamed of. For all the trouble Monsieur de
Vionnet will ever take!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) husband, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) couldn't have expressed how much more intimate
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) it suddenly made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) feel. It wasn't much, in truth--there
were other things in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) was saying that were far more; but it was
as if, while they stood there together so easily in these cold chambers
of the past, the single touch had shown the reach of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) confidence.
<div class="bookquote">``But our friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``hasn't then told you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has told me nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it has come with rather a rush--all in a very few days; and
hasn't moreover yet taken a form that permits an announcement. It's
only for you--absolutely you alone--that I speak; I so want you to
know.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The sense he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had so often had, since the first hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
disembarkment, of being further and further <div class="bookquote">``in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) again at
this moment to another twinge; but in this wonderful way of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) putting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) in there continued to be something exquisitely remorseless.
<div class="bookquote">``Monsieur de Vionnet will accept what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) MUST accept. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) has proposed
half a dozen things--each one more impossible than the other; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
wouldn't have found this if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) lives to a hundred. Chad found it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)
continued with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) lighted, faintly flushed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) conscious confidential
face, <div class="bookquote">``in the quietest way in the world. Or rather it found HIM--for
everything finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); I mean finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) right. You'll think we do such
things strangely--but at my age,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``one has to accept one's
conditions. Our young man's people had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sisters, a
charming woman--we know all about them--had observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) somewhere with
me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) brother--turned him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) on; and we were again
observed, poor Jeanne and I, without our in the least knowing it. It
was at the beginning of the winter; it went on for some time; it
outlasted our absence; it began again on our return; and it luckily
seems all right. The young man had met Chad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) got a friend to
approach him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)--as having a decent interest in us. Mr. Newsome looked
well before he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) leaped; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) kept beautifully quiet and satisfied himself
fully; then only he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) spoke. It's what has for some time past occupied
us. It seems as if it were what would do; really, really all one could
wish. There are only two or three points to be settled--they depend on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) father. But this time I think we're safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, consciously gaping a little, had fairly hung upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) lips.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope so with all my heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) permitted himself: <div class="bookquote">``Does
nothing depend on HER?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah naturally; everything did. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s pleased comme tout. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) has
been perfectly free; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--our young friend--is really a combination.
I quite adore him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether just made sure. <div class="bookquote">``You mean your future son-in-law?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Future if we all bring it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether decorously, <div class="bookquote">``I heartily hope you may.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>There
seemed little else for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to say, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) communication had the
oddest effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). Vaguely and confusedly he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was troubled by it;
feeling as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had even himself been concerned in something deep and
dim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had allowed for depths, but these were greater: and it was as
if, oppressively--indeed absurdly--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was responsible for what they had
now thrown up to the surface. It was--through something ancient and
cold in it--what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have called the real thing. In short his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
hostess's news, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) couldn't have explained why, was a sensible
shock, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) oppression a weight he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) must somehow or other
immediately get rid of. There were too many connexions missing to make
it tolerable he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should do anything else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was prepared to
suffer--before his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own inner tribunal--for Chad; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was prepared to
suffer even for Madame de Vionnet. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wasn't prepared to suffer
for the little girl So now having said the proper thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wanted to
get away. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) an instant, however, with another appeal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I seem to you very awful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Awful? Why so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) called it to himself, even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
biggest insincerity yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our arrangements are so different from yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could dismiss that too! <div class="bookquote">``I haven't any arrangements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must accept mine; all the more that they're excellent.

you to like. Don't be afraid; you'll be satisfied.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could
talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) of what, of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) innermost life--for that was what it came
to--he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) must <div class="bookquote">``accept'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; thus she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could extraordinarily speak as if in
such an affair his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) being satisfied had an importance. It was all a
wonder and made the whole case larger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had struck himself at the
hotel, before Sarah and Waymarsh, as being in her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) boat; but where on
earth was he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) now? This question was in the air till her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) own lips
quenched it with another. <div class="bookquote">``And do you suppose HE (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--who loves her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
so--would do anything reckless or cruel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) supposed. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean your young man--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean yours. I mean Mr. Newsome.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>It flashed for Strether the next
moment a finer light, and the light deepened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) takes,
thank God, the truest tenderest interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It deepened indeed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I'm sure of that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``about one's trusting him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). You see then
how I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) waited a moment--it all came. <div class="bookquote">``I see--I see.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) really did
see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) wouldn't hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) for the world, nor--assuming she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) marries at
all--risk anything that might make against her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) happiness.
And--willingly, at least--he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) would never hurt ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) face, with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had by this time grasped, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
words; whether something had come into it, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) only read
clearer, her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) whole story--what at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) then took for such--reached
out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) from it. With the initiative she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) now attributed to Chad it
all made a sense, and this sense--a light, a lead, was what had
abruptly risen before him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wanted, once more, to get off with these
things; which was at last made easy, a servant having, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
assistance, on hearing voices in the hall, just come forward. All that
Strether had made out was, while the man opened the door and
impersonally waited, summed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last word. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think, you
know, Chad will tell me anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--perhaps not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I won't as yet speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah that's as you'll think best. You must judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had finally given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) hand, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held a moment. <div class="bookquote">``How MUCH
I have to judge!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Vionnet/Vionnet/de Vionnet</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Vionnet: a remark that was indeed--with
the refined disguised suppressed passion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) face--what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) most
carried away.



<p/>II


<p/>So far as a direct approach was concerned Sarah had neglected him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>), for
the week now about to end, with a civil consistency of chill that,
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) a higher idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) social resource, threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) back on the
general reflexion that a woman could always be amazing. It indeed
helped a little to console him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had for the same
period also left Chad's curiosity hanging; though on the other hand,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) personal relief, Chad could at least go through the various
motions--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) made them extraordinarily numerous--of seeing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a
good time. There wasn't a motion on which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presence, poor
Strether could so much as venture, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could do when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was out
of it was to walk over for a talk with Maria. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) walked over of course
much less than usual, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found a special compensation in a certain
half-hour during which, toward the close of a crowded empty expensive
day, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) several companions seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) so disposed of as to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
forms and usages a rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been with them in the morning and had
nevertheless called on the Pococks in the afternoon; but their whole
group, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) then found, had dispersed after a fashion of which it would
amuse Miss Gostrey to hear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was sorry again, gratefully sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
was so out of it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) who had really put him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
fortunately always her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) appetite for news. The pure flame of the
disinterested burned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) cave of treasures as a lamp in a Byzantine
vault. It was just now, as happened, that for so fine a sense as hers
a near view would have begun to pay. Within three days, precisely, the
situation on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to report had shown signs of an equilibrium;
the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) look in at the hotel was to confirm this appearance.
If the equilibrium might only prevail! Sarah was out with Waymarsh,
Mamie was out with Chad, and Jim was out alone. Later on indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
himself was booked to Jim, was to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) that evening to the
Varieties--which Strether was careful to pronounce as Jim pronounced
them.

<p/>Miss Gostrey drank it in. <div class="bookquote">``What then to-night do the others do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it has been arranged. Waymarsh takes Sarah to dine at Bignons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``And what do they do after? They can't come straight
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they can't come straight home--at least Sarah can't. It's their
secret, but I think I've guessed it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) waited: <div class="bookquote">``The circus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) stare a moment longer, then laugh almost to extravagance.
<div class="bookquote">``There's no one like you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like ME?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) only wanted to understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like all of you together--like all of us: Woollett, Milrose and their
products. We're abysmal--but may we never be less so! Mr. Newsome,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``meanwhile takes Miss Pocock--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely--to the Francais: to see what you took Waymarsh and me to,
a family-bill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then may Mr. Chad enjoy it as I did!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) saw so much in
things. <div class="bookquote">``Do they spend their evenings, your young people, like that,
alone together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they're young people--but they're old friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see, I see. And do THEY dine--for a difference--at Brebant's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh where they dine is their secret too. But I've my idea that it will
be, very quietly, at Chad's own place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) there alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked at each other a moment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has known her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) from a child.
Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether with emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``Mamie's remarkable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)'s
splendid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) expects to bring it off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Getting hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)? No--I think not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) doesn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) enough?--or doesn't believe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) power?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>On
which as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) finds she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) doesn't care
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) finds she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) does. But that's what I mean by so
describing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>). It's IF she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) does that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)'s splendid. But we'll see,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) comes out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to show me sufficiently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey laughed, <div class="bookquote">``where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
goes in! But is her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) childhood's friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``permitting
himself recklessly to flirt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not that. Chad's also splendid. They're ALL splendid!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
declared with a sudden strange sound of wistfulness and envy. <div class="bookquote">``They're
at least HAPPY.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy?'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--it appeared, with their various difficulties, to surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I seem to myself among them the only one who isn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) demurred. <div class="bookquote">``With your constant tribute to the ideal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had a laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) tribute to the ideal, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) explained after a
moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) impression. <div class="bookquote">``I mean they're living. They're rushing about.
I've already had my rushing. I'm waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But aren't you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) asked by way of cheer, <div class="bookquote">``waiting with ME?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) in all kindness. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--if it weren't for that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you help me to wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I've
really something for you that will help you to wait and which you shall
have in a minute. Only there's something more I want from you first. I
revel in Sarah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I. If it weren't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) again amusedly sighed, <div class="bookquote">``for THAT--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you owe more to women than any man I ever saw. We do seem to
keep you going. Yet Sarah, as I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), must be great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) IS''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether fully assented: <div class="bookquote">``great! Whatever happens, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
won't, with these unforgettable days, have lived in vain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey had a pause. <div class="bookquote">``You mean she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) has fallen in love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wonders if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hasn't--and it serves all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria laughed, <div class="bookquote">``served women's purposes before!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--for giving in. But I doubt if the idea--as an idea--has ever up
to now answered so well for holding out. That's HER tribute to the
ideal--we each have our own. It's her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) romance--and it seems to me
better on the whole than mine. To have it in Paris too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
explained--<div class="bookquote">``on this classic ground, in this charged infectious air,
with so sudden an intensity: well, it's more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
has had in short to recognise the breaking out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) of a real
affinity--and with everything to enhance the drama.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey followed. <div class="bookquote">``Jim for instance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jim. Jim hugely enhances. Jim was made to enhance. And then Mr.
Waymarsh. It's the crowning touch--it supplies the colour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s
positively separated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) herself unfortunately isn't--that supplies the colour too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey was all there. But somehow--! <div class="bookquote">``Is HE (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) in love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) a long time; then looked all about the room;
then came a little nearer. <div class="bookquote">``Will you never tell any one in the world
as long as ever you live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was charming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) thinks Sarah really is. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) has no fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether hastened to
add.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) being affected by it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) being. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) likes it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) can hold out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s
helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s floating her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) over, by kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria rather funnily considered it. <div class="bookquote">``Floating her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) over in champagne?
The kindness of dining her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), nose to nose, at the hour when all Paris is
crowding to profane delights, and in the--well, in the great temple, as
one hears of it, of pleasure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just IT, for both of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether insisted--<div class="bookquote">``and all of a
supreme innocence. The Parisian place, the feverish hour, the
putting before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) of a hundred francs' worth of food and drink, which
they'll scarcely touch--all that's the dear man's own romance; the
expensive kind, expensive in francs and centimes, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) abounds.
And the circus afterwards--which is cheaper, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll find some
means of making as dear as possible--that's also HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tribute to the
ideal. It does for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) through. They won't talk of
anything worse than you and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we're bad enough perhaps, thank heaven,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``to upset
them! Mr. Waymarsh at any rate is a hideous old coquette.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And the
next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had dropped everything for a different pursuit. <div class="bookquote">``What
you don't appear to know is that Jeanne de Vionnet has become engaged.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)'s to marry--it has been definitely arranged--young Monsieur de
Montbron.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fairly blushed. <div class="bookquote">``Then--if you know it--it's `out'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I often know things that are NOT out? However,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``this
will be out to-morrow. But I see I've counted too much on your
possible ignorance. You've been before me, and I don't make you jump
as I hoped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gave a gasp at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) insight. <div class="bookquote">``You never fail! I've HAD my jump. I
had it when I first heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then if you knew why didn't you tell me as soon as you came in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I had it from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as a thing not yet to be spoken of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey wondered. <div class="bookquote">``From Madame de Vionnet herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a probability--not quite a certainty: a good cause in which Chad
has been working. So I've waited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need wait no longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``It reached me
yesterday--roundabout and accidental, but by a person who had had it
from one of the young man's own people--as a thing quite settled. I
was only keeping it for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought Chad wouldn't have told me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hasn't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hasn't. And yet the thing appears to have been practically his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
doing. So there we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There we are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria candidly echoed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why I jumped. I jumped,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued to explain, <div class="bookquote">``because it
means, this disposition of the daughter, that there's now nothing else:
nothing else but him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) and the mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still--it simplifies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It simplifies'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fully concurred. <div class="bookquote">``But that's precisely where we
are. It marks a stage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) relation. The act is his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) answer to Mrs.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It tells,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria asked, <div class="bookquote">``the worst?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The worst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is the worst what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wants Sarah to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At which Miss Gostrey's eyebrows went up. <div class="bookquote">``You mean she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) has already

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether took a turn about; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had thought it out again and again
before this, to the end; but the vista seemed each time longer. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
wants his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) good friend to know the best. I mean the measure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
attachment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) asked for a sign, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thought of that one. There
it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A concession to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) jealousy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether pulled up. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--call it that. Make it lurid--for that makes
my problem richer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, let us have it lurid--for I quite agree with you that we
want none of our problems poor. But let us also have it clear. Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>),
in the midst of such a preoccupation, or on the heels of it, have
seriously cared for Jeanne?--cared, I mean, as a young man at liberty
would have cared?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, Strether had mastered it. <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can have thought it would
be charming if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) COULD care. It would be nicer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nicer than being tied up to Marie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--than the discomfort of an attachment to a person he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can never
hope, short of a catastrophe, to marry. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said
Strether. <div class="bookquote">``It would certainly have been nicer. Even when a thing's

Marie. The relation is too special and has gone too far. It's the
very basis, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recent lively contribution toward establishing
Jeanne in life has been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) definite and final acknowledgement to
Madame de Vionnet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) has ceased squirming. I doubt meanwhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)

I shall have every inch and every ounce of it. I shall be USED for
it--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Strether lost himself in the prospect. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fancifully
expressed the issue. <div class="bookquote">``To the last drop of my blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria, however, roundly protested. <div class="bookquote">``Ah you'll please keep a drop for

She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had come back the next moment to another matter. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Pocock, with

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the charm's not working?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The best for Madame de Vionnet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had a pause. <div class="bookquote">``The difficulty's Jim. Jim's the note of home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) debated. <div class="bookquote">``Ah surely not the note of Mrs. Newsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had it all. <div class="bookquote">``The note of the home for which Mrs. Newsome wants
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)--the home of the business. Jim stands, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) little legs apart,

awful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria stared. <div class="bookquote">``And you in, you poor thing, for your evening with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s all right for ME!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Any one's good enough

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head with decision. <div class="bookquote">``Not really.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) frankly do the same. <div class="bookquote">``Well, no--since you ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria rubbed it in. <div class="bookquote">``Not really either?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) rates him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) rather high.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With which indeed,
immediately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took himself up. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) IS good too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) way. It
depends on what you want him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey, however, wouldn't let it depend on anything--wouldn't
have it, and wouldn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), at any price. <div class="bookquote">``It suits my book,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) should be impossible; and it suits it still better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
more imaginatively added, <div class="bookquote">``that Mrs. Newsome doesn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, in consequence, had to take it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fell back on
something else. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you who does really know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Waymarsh? Never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never indeed. I'm not ALWAYS thinking of Mr. Waymarsh; in fact I find
now I never am.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mentioned the person as if there were a good
deal in it. <div class="bookquote">``Mamie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) own sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Oddly enough it but let her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) down. <div class="bookquote">``What good will
that do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None perhaps. But there--as usual--we are!''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>III


<p/>There they were yet again, accordingly, for two days more; when
Strether, on being, at Mrs. Pocock's hotel, ushered into that lady's
salon, found himself at first assuming a mistake on the part of the
servant who had introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) and retired. The occupants hadn't come
in, for the room looked empty as only a room can look in Paris, of a
fine afternoon when the faint murmur of the huge collective life,
carried on out of doors, strays among scattered objects even as a
summer air idles in a lonely garden. Our friend looked about and
hesitated; observed, on the evidence of a table charged with purchases
and other matters, that Sarah had become possessed--by no aid from
HIM--of the last number of the salmon-coloured Revue; noted further
that Mamie appeared to have received a present of Fromentin's <div class="bookquote">``Maitres
d'Autrefois''  (<font color='red'><b>Mamie/Mamie Pocock</b></font>)</div>from Chad, who had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) name on the cover; and
pulled up at the sight of a heavy letter addressed in a hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) knew.
This letter, forwarded by a banker and arriving in Mrs. Pocock's
absence, had been placed in evidence, and it drew from the fact of its
being unopened a sudden queer power to intensify the reach of its
author. It brought home to him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) the scale on which Mrs. Newsome--for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had been copious indeed this time--was writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) daughter
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) kept HIM in durance; and it had altogether such an effect
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) as made him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) for a few minutes stand still and breathe low. In
his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) own room, at his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) own hotel, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) had dozens of well-filled envelopes
superscribed in that character; and there was actually something in the
renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) interrupted vision of the character that played straight
into the so frequent question of whether he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) weren't already
disinherited beyond appeal. It was such an assurance as the sharp
downstrokes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) pen hadn't yet had occasion to give him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>); but they
somehow at the present crisis stood for a probable absoluteness in any
decree of the writer. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) looked at Sarah's name and address, in short,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had been looking hard into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother's face, and then turned
from it as if the face had declined to relax. But since it was in a
manner as if Mrs. Newsome were thereby all the more, instead of the
less, in the room, and were conscious, sharply and sorely conscious, of
himself, so he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) felt both held and hushed, summoned to stay at least and
take his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) punishment. By staying, accordingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) took it--creeping
softly and vaguely about and waiting for Sarah to come in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) WOULD
come in if he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) stayed long enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had now more than ever the
sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) success in leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) a prey to anxiety. It wasn't to be
denied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had had a happy instinct, from the point of view of
Woollett, in placing him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) thus at the mercy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) own initiative. It
was very well to try to say he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) didn't care--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) might break ground
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would, might never break it at all if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) wouldn't, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had no confession whatever to wait upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) with: he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) breathed from
day to day an air that damnably required clearing, and there were
moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) quite ached to precipitate that process. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) couldn't
doubt that, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) only oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) by surprising him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
then was, a clarifying scene of some sort would result from the
concussion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) humbly circulated in this spirit till he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) suddenly had a fresh
arrest. Both the windows of the room stood open to the balcony, but it
was only now that, in the glass of the leaf of one of them, folded
back, he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) caught a reflexion quickly recognised as the colour of a
lady's dress. Somebody had been then all the while on the balcony, and
the person, whoever it might be, was so placed between the windows as
to be hidden from him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>); while on the other hand the many sounds of the
street had covered his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) own entrance and movements. If the person were
Sarah he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) might on the spot therefore be served to his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) taste. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) might
lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) by a move or two up to the remedy for his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) vain tension; as to
which, should he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) get nothing else from it, he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) would at least have the
relief of pulling down the roof on their heads. There was fortunately
no one at hand to observe--in respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) valour--that even on this
completed reasoning he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) still hung fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had been waiting for Mrs.
Pocock and the sound of the oracle; but he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had to gird himself
afresh--which he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) did in the embrasure of the window, neither advancing
nor retreating--before provoking the revelation. It was apparently for
Sarah to come more into view; he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was in that case there at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) service.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) did however, as meanwhile happened, come more into view; only she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
luckily came at the last minute as a contradiction of Sarah. The
occupant of the balcony was after all quite another person, a person
presented, on a second look, by a charming back and a slight shift of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) position, as beautiful brilliant unconscious Mamie--Mamie alone at
home, Mamie passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) own innocent way, Mamie in short
rather shabbily used, but Mamie absorbed interested and interesting.
With her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) arms on the balustrade and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) attention dropped to the street
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) allowed Strether to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>), to consider several things, without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) turning round.

<p/>But the oddity was that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) HAD so watched and considered he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) simply
stepped back into the room without following up his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) advantage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
revolved there again for several minutes, quite as with something new
to think of and as if the bearings of the possibility of Sarah had been
superseded. For frankly, yes, it HAD bearings thus to find the girl in
solitary possession. There was something in it that touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to a
point not to have been reckoned beforehand, something that softly but
quite pressingly spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and that spoke the more each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
paused again at the edge of the balcony and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still unaware. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
companions were plainly scattered; Sarah would be off somewhere with
Waymarsh and Chad off somewhere with Jim. Strether didn't at all
mentally impute to Chad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``good friend'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
the benefit of supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) involved in appearances that, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
to describe them--for instance to Maria--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would have conveniently
qualified as more subtle. It came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) indeed the next thing that
there was perhaps almost an excess of refinement in having left Mamie
in such weather up there alone; however she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) might in fact have
extemporised, under the charm of the Rue de Rivoli, a little makeshift
Paris of wonder arid fancy. Our friend in any case now recognised--and
it was as if at the recognition Mrs. Newsome's fixed intensity had
suddenly, with a deep audible gasp, grown thin and vague--that day
after day he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been conscious in respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) young lady of
something odd and ambiguous, yet something into which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could at last
read a meaning. It had been at the most, this mystery, an
obsession--oh an obsession agreeable; and it had just now fallen into
its place as at the touch of a spring. It had represented the
possibility between them of some communication baffled by accident and
delay--the possibility even of some relation as yet unacknowledged.

<p/>There was always their old relation, the fruit of the Woollett years;
but that--and it was what was strangest--had nothing whatever in common
with what was now in the air. As a child, as a <div class="bookquote">``bud,''  (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div>and then again
as a flower of expansion, Mamie had bloomed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>), freely, in the
almost incessantly open doorways of home; where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) as
first very forward, as then very backward--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had carried on at one
period, in Mrs. Newsome's parlours -LRB-oh Mrs. Newsome's phases and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
own!-RRB- a course of English Literature re-enforced by exams and teas--and
once more, finally, as very much in advance. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had kept no great
sense of points of contact; it not being in the nature of things at
Woollett that the freshest of the buds should find herself in the same
basket with the most withered of the winter apples. The child had
given sharpness, above all, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) sense of the flight of time; it was
but the day before yesterday that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had tripped up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) hoop, yet
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) experience of remarkable women--destined, it would seem, remarkably
to grow--felt itself ready this afternoon, quite braced itself, to
include her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had in fine more to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had ever
dreamed the pretty girl of the moment COULD have; and the proof of the
circumstance was that, visibly, unmistakeably, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been able to say
it to no one else. It was something she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could mention neither to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
brother, to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sister-in-law nor to Chad; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could just imagine
that had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still been at home she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have brought it out, as a
supreme tribute to age, authority and attitude, for Mrs. Newsome. It
was moreover something in which they all took an interest; the strength
of their interest was in truth just the reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) prudence. All
this then, for five minutes, was vivid to Strether, and it put before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that, poor child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had now but her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) prudence to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). That,
for a pretty girl in Paris, struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), with a rush, as a sorry state;
so that under the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) with a step as
hypocritically alert, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was well aware, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had just come into
the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) turned with a start at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) voice; preoccupied with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was just a scrap disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I thought
you were Mr. Bilham!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>The remark had been at first surprising and our friend's private
thought, under the influence of it, temporarily blighted; yet we are
able to add that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) presently recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) inward tone and that many a
fresh flower of fancy was to bloom in the same air. Little
Bilham--since little Bilham was, somewhat incongruously,
expected--appeared behindhand; a circumstance by which Strether was to
profit. They came back into the room together after a little, the
couple on the balcony, and amid its crimson-and-gold elegance, with the
others still absent, Strether passed forty minutes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) appraised
even at the time as far, in the whole queer connexion, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) idlest.
Yes indeed, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had the other day so agreed with Maria about the
inspiration of the lurid, here was something for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) problem that
surely didn't make it shrink and that was floated in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as part
of a sudden flood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was doubtless not to know till afterwards, on
turning them over in thought, of how many elements his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) impression was
composed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) none the less felt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sat with the charming girl,
the signal growth of a confidence. For she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) WAS charming, when all was
said--and none the less so for the visible habit and practice of
freedom and fluency. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was charming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was aware, in spite of the
fact that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) something
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should have been in peril of expressing as <div class="bookquote">``funny.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
funny, wonderful Mamie, and without dreaming it; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bland, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
bridal--with never, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could make out as yet, a bridegroom to
support it; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was handsome and portly and easy and chatty, soft and
sweet and almost disconcertingly reassuring. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was dressed, if we
might so far discriminate, less as a young lady than as an old one--had
an old one been supposable to Strether as so committed to vanity; the
complexities of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair missed moreover also the looseness of youth;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a mature manner of bending a little, as to encourage and
reward, while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held neatly together in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a pair of
strikingly polished hands: the combination of all of which kept up
about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the glamour of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``receiving,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>placed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again perpetually
between the windows and within sound of the ice-cream plates, suggested
the enumeration of all the names, all the Mr. Brookses and Mr.
Snookses, gregarious specimens of a single type, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was happy to
<div class="bookquote">``meet.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But if all this was where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was funny, and if what was
funnier than the rest was the contrast between her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beautiful benevolent
patronage--such a hint of the polysyllabic as might make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) something
of a bore toward middle age--and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rather flat little voice, the
voice, naturally, unaffectedly yet, of a girl of fifteen; so Strether,
none the less, at the end of ten minutes, felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a quiet dignity
that pulled things bravely together. If quiet dignity, almost more
than matronly, with voluminous, too voluminous clothes, was the effect
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) proposed to produce, that was an ideal one could like in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when
once one had got into relation. The great thing now for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) visitor
was that this was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had done; it made so extraordinary a
mixture of the brief and crowded hour. It was the mark of a relation
that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had begun so quickly to find himself sure she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, of all
people, as might have been said, on the side and of the party of Mrs.
Newsome's original ambassador. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was in HIS (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) interest and not in
Sarah's, and some sign of that was precisely what he (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) had been feeling
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), these last days, as imminent. Finally placed, in Paris, in
immediate presence of the situation and of the hero of it--by whom
Strether was incapable of meaning any one but Chad--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had
accomplished, and really in a manner all unexpected to herself, a
change of base; deep still things had come to pass within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), and by
the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had grown sure of them Strether had become aware of the
little drama. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) knew where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was, in short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had made it
out; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) made it out at present still better; though with never a
direct word passing between them all the while on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
own predicament. There had been at first, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sat there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), a
moment during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) meant to break ground in respect
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) prime undertaking. That door stood so strangely ajar that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
was half-prepared to be conscious, at any juncture, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) having, of
any one's having, quite bounced in. But, friendly, familiar, light of
touch and happy of tact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) exquisitely stayed out; so that it was for
all the world as if to show she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) could deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) without being
reduced to--well, scarcely anything.

<p/>It fully came up for them then, by means of their talking of everything
BUT Chad, that Mamie, unlike Sarah, unlike Jim, knew perfectly what had
become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). It fully came up that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had taken to the last
fraction of an inch the measure of the change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
wanted Strether to know what a secret she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) proposed to make of it. They
talked most conveniently--as if they had had no chance yet--about
Woollett; and that had virtually the effect of their keeping the secret
more close. The hour took on for Strether, little by little, a queer
sad sweetness of quality, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had such a revulsion in Mamie's favour and
on behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) social value as might have come from remorse at some
early injustice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), as under the breath of some vague
western whiff, homesick and freshly restless; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could really for the
time have fancied himself stranded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) on a far shore, during an
ominous calm, in a quaint community of shipwreck. Their little
interview was like a picnic on a coral strand; they passed each other,
with melancholy smiles and looks sufficiently allusive, such cupfuls of
water as they had saved. Especially sharp in Strether meanwhile was
the conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion really knew, as we have hinted, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had come out. It was at a very particular place--only THAT she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
would never tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); it would be above all what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should have to
puzzle for himself. This was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hoped for, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interest
in the girl wouldn't be complete without it. No more would the
appreciation to which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was entitled--so assured was he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that the more
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) process the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should see of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pride. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw,
herself, everything; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't want, and that it was
that had helped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). What didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) want?--there was a pleasure lost
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) old friend in not yet knowing, as there would doubtless be a
thrill in getting a glimpse. Gently and sociably she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept that dark to
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soothed and beguiled him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in other ways to
make up for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came out with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) impression of Madame de
Vionnet--of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``heard so much'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came out with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
impression of Jeanne, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been <div class="bookquote">``dying to see'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brought it
out with a blandness by which her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) auditor was really stirred that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had been with Sarah early that very afternoon, and after dreadful
delays caused by all sorts of things, mainly, eternally, by the
purchase of clothes--clothes that unfortunately wouldn't be themselves
eternal--to call in the Rue de Bellechasse.

<p/>At the sound of these names Strether almost blushed to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
couldn't have sounded them first--and yet couldn't either have
justified his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) squeamishness. Mamie made them easy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) couldn't have
begun to do, and yet it could only have cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should
ever have had to spend. It was as friends of Chad's, friends special,
distinguished, desirable, enviable, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) spoke of them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
beautifully carried it off that much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had heard of them--though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) didn't say how or where, which was a touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) own--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had
found them beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) supposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) abounded in praise of them, and
after the manner of Woollett--which made the manner of Woollett a
loveable thing again to Strether. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never so felt the true
inwardness of it as when his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) blooming companion pronounced the elder of
the ladies of the Rue de Bellechasse too fascinating for words and
declared of the younger that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) was perfectly ideal, a real little
monster of charm. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) said of Jeanne, <div class="bookquote">``ought ever to happen
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)'s so awfully right as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) is. Another touch will spoil
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) oughtn't to BE touched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jeanne/Jeanne de Vionnet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but things, here in Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether observed, <div class="bookquote">``do happen to little
girls.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And then for the joke's and the occasion's sake: <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you
found that yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That things happen--? Oh I'm not a little girl. I'm a big battered
blowsy one. I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mamie/Mamie Pocock</b></font>)</div>Mamie laughed, <div class="bookquote">``WHAT happens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mamie/Mamie Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had a pause while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondered if it mightn't happen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
should give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) the pleasure of learning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) nicer than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had really dreamed--a pause that ended when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had said to himself
that, so far as it at all mattered for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had in fact perhaps
already made this out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) risked accordingly a different
question--though conscious, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had spoken, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) seemed to
place it in relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) last speech. <div class="bookquote">``But that Mademoiselle de
Vionnet is to be married--I suppose you've heard of THAT.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
then found, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) need fear! <div class="bookquote">``Dear, yes; the gentleman was there:
Monsieur de Montbron, whom Madame de Vionnet presented to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) nice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mamie/Mamie Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/>Mamie bloomed and bridled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) best reception manner. <div class="bookquote">``Any man's
nice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)'s in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It made Strether laugh. <div class="bookquote">``But is Monsieur de Montbron in
love--already--with YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh that's not necessary--it's so much better he (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) should be so with HER:
which, thank goodness, I lost no time in discovering for myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>)'s
perfectly gone--and I couldn't have borne it for her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) hadn't been.
She (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)'s just too sweet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``And through being in love too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>On which with a smile that struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as wonderful Mamie had a
wonderful answer. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) doesn't know if she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) again laugh out. <div class="bookquote">``Oh but YOU do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) was willing to take it that way. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I know everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) sat there rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) polished hands and making the best of
it--only holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) elbows perhaps a little too much out--the
momentary effect for Strether was that every one else, in all their
affair, seemed stupid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know that poor little Jeanne doesn't know what's the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as near as they came to saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) was probably in love
with Chad; but it was quite near enough for what Strether wanted; which
was to be confirmed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) certitude that, whether in love or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
appealed to something large and easy in the girl before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). Mamie
would be fat, too fat, at thirty; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) would always be the person
who, at the present sharp hour, had been disinterestedly tender. <div class="bookquote">``If I
see a little more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>), as I hope I shall, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)'ll like me

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `then'--Mr. Newsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something really grand for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in the serenity of this

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Last only'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) good-humouredly kept it up.

<p/>Strether considered. <div class="bookquote">``So that every one after all then will be suited?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) few hesitations, but it was a question only of a
moment; and it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) nearest approach to being explicit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
about what was between them. <div class="bookquote">``I think I can speak for myself. I shall
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It said indeed so much, told such a story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) being ready to help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), so committed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that truth, in short, for such use as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might
make of it toward those ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own with which, patiently and
trustfully, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) had nothing to do--it so fully achieved all this that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) appeared to himself simply to meet it in its own spirit by the last
frankness of admiration. Admiration was of itself almost accusatory,
but nothing less would serve to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) how nearly he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand for good-bye with a <div class="bookquote">``Splendid, splendid, splendid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) splendour, still waiting for little Bilham.





<p/>Book Tenth




<p/>I


<p/>Strether occupied beside little Bilham, three evenings after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
interview with Mamie Pocock, the same deep divan they had enjoyed
together on the first occasion of our friend's meeting Madame de
Vionnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) daughter in the apartment of the Boulevard Malesherbes,
where his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) position affirmed itself again as ministering to an easy
exchange of impressions. The present evening had a different stamp; if
the company was much more numerous, so, inevitably, were the ideas set
in motion. It was on the other hand, however, now strongly marked that
the talkers moved, in respect to such matters, round an inner, a
protected circle. They knew at any rate what really concerned them
to-night, and Strether had begun by keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion close to it.
Only a few of Chad's guests had dined--that is fifteen or twenty, a few
compared with the large concourse offered to sight by eleven o'clock;
but number and mass, quantity and quality, light, fragrance, sound, the
overflow of hospitality meeting the high tide of response, had all from
the first pressed upon Strether's consciousness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt himself
somehow part and parcel of the most festive scene, as the term was, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had ever in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) life been engaged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had perhaps seen, on
Fourths of July and on dear old domestic Commencements, more people
assembled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never seen so many in proportion to the space, or
had at all events never known so great a promiscuity to show so
markedly as picked. Numerous as was the company, it had still been made
so by selection, and what was above all rare for Strether was that, by
no fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was in the secret of the principle that had
worked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't enquired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head, but Chad had put
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a pair of questions that themselves smoothed the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't
answered the questions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had replied that they were the young man's
own affair; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had then seen perfectly that the latter's direction
was already settled.

<p/>Chad had applied for counsel only by way of intimating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) knew
what to do; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had clearly never known it better than in now
presenting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sister the whole circle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) society. This was all
in the sense and the spirit of the note struck by him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) on that lady's
arrival; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had taken at the station itself a line that led him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) without
a break, and that enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to lead the Pococks--though dazed a
little, no doubt, breathless, no doubt, and bewildered--to the
uttermost end of the passage accepted by them perforce as pleasant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had made it for them violently pleasant and mercilessly full; the
upshot of which was, to Strether's vision, that they had come all the
way without discovering it to be really no passage at all. It was a
brave blind alley, where to pass was impossible and where, unless they
stuck fast, they would have--which was always awkward--publicly to back
out. They were touching bottom assuredly tonight; the whole scene
represented the terminus of the cul-de-sac. So could things go when
there was a hand to keep them consistent--a hand that pulled the wire
with a skill at which the elder man more and more marvelled. The elder
man felt responsible, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also felt successful, since what had taken
place was simply the issue of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own contention, six weeks before,
that they properly should wait to see what their friends would have
really to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had determined Chad to wait, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
to see; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was therefore not to quarrel with the time given up to the
business. As much as ever, accordingly, now that a fortnight had
elapsed, the situation created for Sarah, and against which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had
raised no protest, was that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) having accommodated herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
adventure as to a pleasure-party surrendered perhaps even somewhat in
excess to bustle and to <div class="bookquote">``pace.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>If her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) brother had been at any point
the least bit open to criticism it might have been on the ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
spicing the draught too highly and pouring the cup too full. Frankly
treating the whole occasion of the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) relatives as an
opportunity for amusement, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) left it, no doubt, but scant margin as an
opportunity for anything else. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) suggested, invented, abounded--yet
all the while with the loosest easiest rein. Strether, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own
weeks, had gained a sense of knowing Paris; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw it afresh, and
with fresh emotion, in the form of the knowledge offered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
colleague.

<p/>A thousand unuttered thoughts hummed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in the air of these
observations; not the least frequent of which was that Sarah might well
of a truth not quite know whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was drifting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was in no
position not to appear to expect that Chad should treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) handsomely;
yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) struck our friend as privately stiffening a little each time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) missed the chance of marking the great nuance. The great nuance was
in brief that of course her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) brother must treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) handsomely--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not; but that treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) handsomely, none the
less, wasn't all in all--treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) handsomely buttered no parsnips;
and that in fine there were moments when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) felt the fixed eyes of
their admirable absent mother fairly screw into the flat of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) back.
Strether, watching, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) habit, and overscoring with thought,
positively had moments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found himself sorry for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)--occasions on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as a person seated in a
runaway vehicle and turning over the question of a possible jump. WOULD
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) jump, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), would THAT be a safe placed--this question, at
such instants, sat for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) lapse into pallor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) tight lips,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) conscious eyes. It came back to the main point at issue: would she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
be, after all, to be squared? He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) believed on the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would jump;
yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) alternations on this subject were the more especial stuff of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) suspense. One thing remained well before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--a conviction that
was in fact to gain sharpness from the impressions of this evening:
that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) SHOULD gather in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) skirts, close her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) eyes and quit the
carriage while in motion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would promptly enough become aware. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
would alight from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) headlong course more or less directly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>);
it would be appointed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), unquestionably, to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) entire
weight. Signs and portents of the experience thus in reserve for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had as it happened, multiplied even through the dazzle of Chad's party.
It was partly under the nervous consciousness of such a prospect that,
leaving almost every one in the two other rooms, leaving those of the
guests already known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as well as a mass of brilliant strangers of
both sexes and of several varieties of speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had desired five
quiet minutes with little Bilham, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) always found soothing and
even a little inspiring, and to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had actually moreover something
distinct and important to say.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had felt of old--for it already seemed long ago--rather humiliated
at discovering he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) could learn in talk with a personage so much his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
junior the lesson of a certain moral ease; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had now got used to
that--whether or no the mixture of the fact with other humiliations had
made it indistinct, whether or no directly from little Bilham's
example, the example of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) being contentedly just the obscure and
acute little Bilham he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was. It worked so for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>), Strether seemed to
see; and our friend had at private hours a wan smile over the fact that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself, after so many more years, was still in search of something
that would work. However, as we have said, it worked just now for them
equally to have found a corner a little apart. What particularly kept
it apart was the circumstance that the music in the salon was
admirable, with two or three such singers as it was a privilege to hear
in private. Their presence gave a distinction to Chad's entertainment,
and the interest of calculating their effect on Sarah was actually so
sharp as to be almost painful. Unmistakeably, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) single person,
the motive of the composition and dressed in a splendour of crimson
which affected Strether as the sound of a fall through a skylight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
would now be in the forefront of the listening circle and committed by
it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) eyes. Those eyes during the wonderful dinner itself he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
hadn't once met; having confessedly--perhaps a little
pusillanimously--arranged with Chad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should be on the same side
of the table. But there was no use in having arrived now with little
Bilham at an unprecedented point of intimacy unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) could pitch
everything into the pot. <div class="bookquote">``You who sat where you could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>), what
does she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) make of it all? By which I mean on what terms does she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) take
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) takes it, I judge, as proving that the claim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) family is
more than ever justified.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) isn't then pleased with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) has to show?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)'s pleased with it as with his (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) capacity to do this
kind of thing--more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) has been pleased with anything for a long
time. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) to show it THERE. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) has no right to waste it
on the likes of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) to move the whole thing over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole thing--with an important exception. Everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) has
`picked up'--and the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Montbron</b></font>) knows how. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>) sees no difficulty in that.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)'d run the show herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeanne</b></font>)'ll make the handsome concession
that Woollett would be on the whole in some ways the better for it. Not
that it wouldn't be also in some ways the better for Woollett. The
people there are just as good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as good as you and these others? Ah that may be. But such an
occasion as this, whether or no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said, <div class="bookquote">``isn't the people.
It's what has made the people possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend replied, <div class="bookquote">``there you are; I give you my
impression for what it's worth. Mrs. Pocock has SEEN, and that's
to-night how she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) sits there. If you were to have a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) face
you'd understand me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) has made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) mind--to the sound of
expensive music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether took it freely in. <div class="bookquote">``Ah then I shall have news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to frighten you, but I think that likely. However,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham continued, <div class="bookquote">``if I'm of the least use to you to hold on
by--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not of the least!'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--and Strether laid an appreciative hand on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to say it. <div class="bookquote">``No one's of the least.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With which, to mark how gaily
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could take it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's knee. <div class="bookquote">``I must meet my fate
alone, and I SHALL--oh you'll see! And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pursued the next
moment, <div class="bookquote">``you CAN help me too. You once said to me'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) followed this
further--<div class="bookquote">``that you held Chad should marry. I didn't see then so well as
I know now that you meant he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should marry Miss Pocock. Do you still
consider that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should? Because if you do'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) kept it up--<div class="bookquote">``I want
you immediately to change your mind. You can help me that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Help you by thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should NOT marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not marry at all events Mamie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether returned, <div class="bookquote">``that I'm not obliged to say. But Madame de
Vionnet--I suggest--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>said little Bilham with some sharpness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh precisely! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) needn't marry at all--I'm at any rate not
obliged to provide for it. Whereas in your case I rather feel that I
AM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham was amused. <div class="bookquote">``Obliged to provide for my marrying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--after all I've done to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man weighed it. <div class="bookquote">``Have you done as much as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, thus challenged, <div class="bookquote">``of course I must remember what
you've also done to ME. We may perhaps call it square. But all the
same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I wish awfully you'd marry Mamie Pocock yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham laughed out. <div class="bookquote">``Why it was only the other night, in this
very place, that you were proposing to me a different union altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle de Vionnet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Well, Strether easily confessed it. <div class="bookquote">``That,
I admit, was a vain image. THIS is practical politics. I want to do
something good for both of you--I wish you each so well; and you can
see in a moment the trouble it will save me to polish you off by the
same stroke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) likes you, you know. You console her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'s
splendid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham stared as a delicate appetite stares at an overheaped
plate. <div class="bookquote">``What do I console her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>It just made his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend impatient. <div class="bookquote">``Oh come, you knows''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what proves for you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) likes me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why the fact that I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) three days ago stopping at home alone
all the golden afternoon on the mere chance that you'd come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>), and
hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) balcony on that of seeing your cab drive up. I don't
know what you want more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham after a moment found it. <div class="bookquote">``Only just to know what proves
to you that I like HER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh if what I've just mentioned isn't enough to make you do it, you're
a stony-hearted little fiend. Besides'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether encouraged his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
fancy's flight--<div class="bookquote">``you showed your inclination in the way you kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
waiting, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) on purpose to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) cared enough for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) ingenuity the deference of a pause. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) waiting. I came at the hour. I wouldn't have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
waiting for the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man honourably declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better still--then there you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And Strether, charmed, held him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
the faster. <div class="bookquote">``Even if you didn't do her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) justice, moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``I should insist on your immediately coming round to it. I
want awfully to have worked it. I want'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and our friend spoke now with
a yearning that was really earnest--<div class="bookquote">``at least to have done THAT.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To have married me off--without a penny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I shan't live long; and I give you my word, now and here, that
I'll leave you every penny of my own. I haven't many, unfortunately,
but you shall have them all. And Miss Pocock, I think, has a few. I
want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on, <div class="bookquote">``to have been at least to that extent
constructive even expiatory. I've been sacrificing so to strange gods
that I feel I want to put on record, somehow, my
fidelity--fundamentally unchanged after all--to our own. I feel as if
my hands were embrued with the blood of monstrous alien altars--of
another faith altogether. There it is--it's done.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) further
explained. <div class="bookquote">``It took hold of me because the idea of getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) quite
out of the way for Chad helps to clear my ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man, at this, bounced about, and it brought them face to face
in admitted amusement. <div class="bookquote">``You want me to marry as a convenience to Chad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether debated--<div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) doesn't care whether you marry or not. It's
as a convenience simply to my own plan FOR him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Simply'!'' (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>--and little Bilham's concurrence was in itself a lively
comment. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. But I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``you had exactly
NO plan `for' him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then call it my plan for myself--which may be well, as you say,
to have none. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) situation, don't you see? is reduced now to the bare
facts one has to recognise. Mamie doesn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) doesn't
want Mamie: so much as that these days have made clear. It's a thread
we can wind up and tuck in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>But little Bilham still questioned. <div class="bookquote">``YOU can--since you seem so much
to want to. But why should I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Strether thought it over, but was obliged of course to admit that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) demonstration did superficially fail. <div class="bookquote">``Seriously, there is no
reason. It's my affair--I must do it alone. I've only my fantastic
need of making my dose stiff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham wondered. <div class="bookquote">``What do you call your dose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why what I have to swallow. I want my conditions unmitigated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had spoken in the tone of talk for talk's sake, and yet with an
obscure truth lurking in the loose folds; a circumstance presently not
without its effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) young friend. Little Bilham's eyes rested on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) a moment with some intensity; then suddenly, as if everything had
cleared up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) gave a happy laugh. It seemed to say that if
pretending, or even trying, or still even hoping, to be able to care
for Mamie would be of use, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) was all there for the job. <div class="bookquote">``I'll do
anything in the world for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether smiled, <div class="bookquote">``anything in the world is all I want. I don't
know anything that pleased me in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``than the way
that, on my finding her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) up there all alone, coming on her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) unawares and
feeling greatly for her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) being so out of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) knocked down my tall
house of cards with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) instant and cheerful allusion to the next young
man. It was somehow so the note I needed--her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) staying at home to
receive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Chad of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>said little Bilham, <div class="bookquote">``who asked the next young
man--I like your name for me!--to call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I supposed--all of which, thank God, is in our innocent and natural
manners. But do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked, <div class="bookquote">``if Chad knows--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And
then as this interlocutor seemed at a loss: <div class="bookquote">``Why where she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) has come
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this interlocutor</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham, at this, met his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) face with a conscious look--it was as
if, more than anything yet, the allusion had penetrated. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know
yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether lightly shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``There I stop. Oh, odd as it may
appear to you, there ARE things I don't know. I only got the sense
from her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) of something very sharp, and yet very deep down, that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was
keeping all to herself. That is I had begun with the belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
HAD kept it to herself; but face to face with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) there I soon made out
that there was a person with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would have shared it. I had
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) possibly might with ME--but I saw then that I was only half
in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) confidence. When, turning to me to greet me--for she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was on the
balcony and I had come in without her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) knowing it--she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) showed me she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had
been expecting YOU and was proportionately disappointed, I got hold of
the tail of my conviction. Half an hour later I was in possession of
all the rest of it. You know what has happened.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
young friend hard--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt sure. <div class="bookquote">``For all you say, you're up to
your eyes. So there you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham after an instant pulled half round. <div class="bookquote">``I assure you she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
hasn't told me anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hasn't. For what do you suggest that I suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to
take you? But you've been with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) every day, you've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) freely,
you've liked her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) greatly--I stick to that--and you've made your profit
of it. You know what she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) has been through as well as you know that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
has dined here to-night--which must have put her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), by the way, through a
good deal more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man faced this blast; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulled round the rest of
the way. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't in the least said she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hasn't been nice to me. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s proud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And quite properly. But not too proud for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) pride that has made her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). Chad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>little Bilham loyally
went on, <div class="bookquote">``has really been as kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) as possible. It's awkward for
a man when a girl's in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) isn't--now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham sat staring before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>); then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) sprang up as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
friend's penetration, recurrent and insistent, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) really after
all too nervous. <div class="bookquote">``No--she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) isn't now. It isn't in the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) went
on, <div class="bookquote">``Chad's fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s really all right. I mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would have been
willing. But she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) came over with ideas. Those she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had got at home.
They had been her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) motive and support in joining her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was to SAVE our friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah like me, poor thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether also got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly--she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had a bad moment. It was very soon distinct to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), to
pull her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) up, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) down, that, alas, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) IS, saved. There's
nothing left for her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even to love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) better as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) originally believed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered <div class="bookquote">``Of course one asks one's self what notion a little
girl forms, where a young man's in question, of such a history and such
a state.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, this little girl saw them, no doubt, as obscure, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw
them practically as wrong. The wrong for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) WAS the obscure. Chad
turns out at any rate right and good and disconcerting, while what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was all prepared for, primed and girded and wound up for, was to deal
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as the general opposite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet wasn't her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whole point'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether weighed it--<div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was to be,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) COULD be, made better, redeemed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham fixed it all a moment, and then with a small headshake

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'' (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion saw enough. <div class="bookquote">``Still, if the worst fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)

her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own miracle. THAT<div class="bookquote">``S what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s too late for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether quite felt how it all fitted, yet there seemed one loose
piece. <div class="bookquote">``I'm bound to say, you know, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strikes one, on these
lines, as fastidious--what you call here difficile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Bilham tossed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) chin. <div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s difficile--on any
lines! What else in the world ARE our Mamies--the real, the right
ones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>our friend repeated, charmed by the responsive wisdom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had ended by so richly extracting. <div class="bookquote">``Mamie is one of the real and
the right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what it comes to then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on, <div class="bookquote">``is that poor awful Chad
is simply too good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah too good was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was after all to be; but it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) herself,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) herself only, who was to have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It hung beautifully together, but with still a loose end. <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should after all break--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) actual influence?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bilham/Mr. Bilham</b></font>)</div>Oh little Bilham had for this enquiry the
sharpest of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) controls. <div class="bookquote">``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) `do'--on any terms
whatever--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s flagrantly spoiled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether could only meet the question with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) passive, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) receptive
pleasure. ``Well, thank goodness, YOU<div class="bookquote">``RE not! You remain for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) to
save, and I come back, on so beautiful and full a demonstration, to my
contention of just now--that of your showing distinct signs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
having already begun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The most he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could further say to himself--as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) young friend turned
away--was that the charge encountered for the moment no renewed denial.
Little Bilham, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) course back to the music, only shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
good-natured ears an instant, in the manner of a terrier who has got
wet; while Strether relapsed into the sense--which had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in these
days most of comfort--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was free to believe in anything that from
hour to hour kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) going. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had positively motions and flutters of
this conscious hour-to-hour kind, temporary surrenders to irony, to
fancy, frequent instinctive snatches at the growing rose of
observation, constantly stronger for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt, in scent and
colour, and in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could bury his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nose even to wantonness. This
last resource was offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), for that matter, in the very form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
next clear perception--the vision of a prompt meeting, in the doorway
of the room, between little Bilham and brilliant Miss Barrace, who was
entering as Bilham withdrew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had apparently put him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) a question, to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had replied by turning to indicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) late interlocutor;
toward whom, after an interrogation further aided by a resort to that
optical machinery which seemed, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) other ornaments, curious and
archaic, the genial lady, suggesting more than ever for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fellow
guest the old French print, the historic portrait, directed herself
with an intention that Strether instantly met. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew in advance the
first note she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would sound, and took in as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) approached all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) need
of sounding it. Nothing yet had been so <div class="bookquote">``wonderful''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>between them as
the present occasion; and it was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) special sense of this quality in
occasions that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was there, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in most places, to feed. That
sense had already been so well fed by the situation about them that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had quitted the other room, forsaken the music, dropped out of the
play, abandoned, in a word, the stage itself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might stand a
minute behind the scenes with Strether and so perhaps figure as one of
the famous augurs replying, behind the oracle, to the wink of the
other. Seated near him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) presently where little Bilham had sat, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
replied in truth to many things; beginning as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had said to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) said without fatuity--<div class="bookquote">``All you ladies are
extraordinarily kind to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) played her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) long handle, which shifted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) observation; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw in
an instant all the absences that left them free. ``How can we be
anything else? But isn't that exactly your plight? <div class="bookquote">``We ladies'--oh
we're nice, and you must be having enough of us! As one of us, you
know, I don't pretend I'm crazy about us. But Miss Gostrey at least
to-night has left you alone, hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again looked
about as if Maria might still lurk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)'s only sitting up for me at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And
then as this elicited from his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) gay <div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) meant sitting up in suspense and prayer. <div class="bookquote">``We thought
it on the whole better she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) shouldn't be present; and either way of
course it's a terrible worry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) abounded in the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
appeal to the ladies, and they might take their choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) doing so
from humility or from pride. <div class="bookquote">``Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) inclines to believe I shall come
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I incline to believe too you'll come out!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Miss Barrace, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
laugh, was not to be behind. <div class="bookquote">``Only the question's about WHERE, isn't
it? However,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) happily continued, <div class="bookquote">``if it's anywhere at all it must
be very far on, mustn't it? To do us justice, I think, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
laughed, <div class="bookquote">``we do, among us all, want you rather far on. Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
repeated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) quick droll way; <div class="bookquote">``we want you very, VERY far on!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wished to know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had thought it better Maria shouldn't
be present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``it was really her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own idea. I should have wished
it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dreads responsibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And isn't that a new thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To dread it? No doubt--no doubt. But her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nerve has given way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Barrace looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has too much at stake.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then
less gravely: <div class="bookquote">``Mine, luckily for me, holds out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Luckily for me too'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether came back to that. <div class="bookquote">``My own isn't so
firm, MY appetite for responsibility isn't so sharp, as that I haven't
felt the very principle of this occasion to be `the more the merrier.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>If we ARE so merry it's because Chad has understood so well.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has understood amazingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Barrace.

<p/>``It's wonderful--Strether anticipated for her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's wonderful!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), to meet it, intensified; so that, face to face
over it, they largely and recklessly laughed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) presently added:
<div class="bookquote">``Oh I see the principle. If one didn't one would be lost. But when
once one has got hold of it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's as simple as twice two! From the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had to do something--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A crowd'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) straight up--<div class="bookquote">``was the only thing? Rather,

the theme.

<p/>Strether followed, but scrupulous of justice. <div class="bookquote">``Yet with every one in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonderfully--but just so that it does build her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'s bricked

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether seemed for a moment to look at it; but it brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to a
sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Oh but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'s not dead! It will take more than this to kill
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) remained pensive as if with the same compunction. <div class="bookquote">``It's only up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) chin.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then again for the fun of it: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) can breathe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) focussed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) clink of chains. <div class="bookquote">``Well--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be enough for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether ruefully laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Waymarsh has

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered. <div class="bookquote">``And how did you try?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why I didn't speak of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was silent a little. <div class="bookquote">``No, it's Mr. Waymarsh's. It's the fault of

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) couldn't afford not to.''

slightly at sea: <div class="bookquote">``The man who had succeeded with ME, don't you see?

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether saw, but as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) path was still strewn with surprises. <div class="bookquote">``It's
`from' you then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) has got him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was amused at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) momentary muddle. ``You can fancy my fight! She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) joy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether sceptically murmured.

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--isn't it indeed funny?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace quite rose to it. <div class="bookquote">``That's
the way we ARE in Paris.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was always pleased with a new

<div class="bookquote">``I think that must be why the hero has taken refuge in this corner.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) winced at it as at the very voice of prophecy, and it kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a
moment quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), however, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) appearing about to
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) alone in the rather cold clearance their talk had made.
<div class="bookquote">``There positively isn't a sign of a hero to-night; the hero's dodging

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew it. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)'s more wonderful than ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Than ever. With Mr. Pocock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered. <div class="bookquote">``Madame de Vionnet--with Jim?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame de Vionnet--with `Jim.'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace was historic.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah you must ask HIM!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's face lighted again at the prospect. <div class="bookquote">``It WILL be amusing to
do so.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued to wonder. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) must have some idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) has--she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) has twenty ideas. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) has in the first place,''

her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) part. Her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) part is to help YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It came out as nothing had come yet; links were missing and connexions
unnamed, but it was suddenly as if they were at the heart of their
subject. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; how much more she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) does it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether gravely reflected,
<div class="bookquote">``than I help HER!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>It all came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as with the near presence of
the beauty, the grace, the intense, dissimulated spirit with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said, been putting off contact. <div class="bookquote">``SHE has courage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) has courage!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace quite agreed; and it was as if for a
moment they saw the quantity in each other's face.

<p/>But indeed the whole thing was present. <div class="bookquote">``How much she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) must care!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah there it is. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) does care. But it isn't, is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether seemed suddenly to like to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really never had. <div class="bookquote">``Why
of course it's the whole point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Voila!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Barrace smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's why one came out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on. <div class="bookquote">``And it's why one has
stayed so long. And it's also'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) abounded--<div class="bookquote">``why one's going home.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's why everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) concurred. ``It's why she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) might be
to-night--for all she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) looks and shows, and for all your friend <div class="bookquote">``Jim'

more than sufficiently before them. <div class="bookquote">``When Mr. Newsome has his (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hands so

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's quite the least'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether filled it out--<div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should take

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh it IS funny.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That of course essentially went with it.

<p/>But it brought them back. <div class="bookquote">``How indeed then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must care!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>In answer to
which Strether's entertainer dropped a comprehensive <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether entertainer</b></font>)</div>expressive
perhaps of some impatience for the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took to get used to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
herself had got used to it long before.



<p/>II


<p/>When one morning within the week he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) perceived the whole thing to be
really at last upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) Strether's immediate feeling was all relief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had known this morning that something was about to happen--known it, in
a moment, by Waymarsh's manner when Waymarsh appeared before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) during
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) brief consumption of coffee and a roll in the small slippery
salle-a-manger so associated with rich rumination. Strether had taken
there of late various lonely and absent-minded meals; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) communed
there, even at the end of June, with a suspected chill, the air of old
shivers mixed with old savours, the air in which so many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
impressions had perversely matured; the place meanwhile renewing its
message to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) by the very circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) single state. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now
sat there, for the most part, to sigh softly, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) vaguely tilted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) carafe, over the vision of how much better Waymarsh was occupied.
That was really his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) success by the common measure--to have led this
companion so on and on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) remembered how at first there had been
scarce a squatting-place he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could beguile him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) into passing; the actual
outcome of which at last was that there was scarce one that could
arrest him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) rush. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) rush--as Strether vividly and amusedly
figured it--continued to be all with Sarah, and contained perhaps
moreover the word of the whole enigma, whipping up in its fine
full-flavoured froth the very principle, for good or for ill, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
own, of Strether's destiny. It might after all, to the end, only be
that they had united to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and indeed, so far as Waymarsh was
concerned, that HAD to be the spring of action. Strether was glad at
all events, in connexion with the case, that the saving he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) required was
not more scant; so constituted a luxury was it in certain lights just
to lurk there out of the full glare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had moments of quite seriously
wondering whether Waymarsh wouldn't in fact, thanks to old friendship
and a conceivable indulgence, make about as good terms for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
might make for himself. They wouldn't be the same terms of course; but
they might have the advantage that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself probably should be able
to make none at all.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was never in the morning very late, but Waymarsh had already been
out, and, after a peep into the dim refectory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) presented himself
with much less than usual of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) large looseness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had made sure,
through the expanse of glass exposed to the court, that they would be
alone; and there was now in fact that about him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that pretty well took
up the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was dressed in the garments of summer; and save that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) white waistcoat was redundant and bulging these things favoured,
they determined, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) expression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wore a straw hat such as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
friend hadn't yet seen in Paris, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) showed a buttonhole freshly
adorned with a magnificent rose. Strether read on the instant his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
story--how, astir for the previous hour, the sprinkled newness of the
day, so pleasant at that season in Paris, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was fairly panting with
the pulse of adventure and had been with Mrs. Pocock, unmistakeably, to
the Marche aux Fleurs. Strether really knew in this vision of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a joy
that was akin to envy; so reversed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stood there did their old
positions seem; so comparatively doleful now showed, by the sharp turn
of the wheel, the posture of the pilgrim from Woollett. He (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) wondered,
this pilgrim, if he (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) had originally looked to Waymarsh so brave and
well, so remarkably launched, as it was at present the latter's
privilege to appear. He (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) recalled that his (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) friend had remarked to him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>)
even at Chester that his (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) aspect belied his (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) plea of prostration; but
there certainly couldn't have been, for an issue, an aspect less
concerned than Waymarsh's with the menace of decay. Strether had at
any rate never resembled a Southern planter of the great days--which
was the image picturesquely suggested by the happy relation between the
fuliginous face and the wide panama of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) visitor. This type, it
further amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to guess, had been, on Waymarsh's part, the object
of Sarah's care; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) taste had not been a
stranger to the conception and purchase of the hat, any more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
fine fingers had been guiltless of the bestowal of the rose. It came
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in the current of thought, as things so oddly did come, that HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had never risen with the lark to attend a brilliant woman to the Marche
aux Fleurs; this could be fastened on him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in connexion neither with
Miss Gostrey nor with Madame de Vionnet; the practice of getting up
early for adventures could indeed in no manner be fastened on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). It
came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) in fact that just here was his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) usual case: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was for ever
missing things through his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) general genius for missing them, while
others were for ever picking them up through a contrary bent. And it
was others who looked abstemious and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) who looked greedy; it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
somehow who finally paid, and it was others who mainly partook. Yes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) should go to the scaffold yet for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wouldn't know quite whom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
almost, for that matter, felt on the scaffold now and really quite
enjoying it. It worked out as BECAUSE he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was anxious there--it worked
out as for this reason that Waymarsh was so blooming. It was HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) trip
for health, for a change, that proved the success--which was just what
Strether, planning and exerting himself, had desired it should be. That
truth already sat full-blown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion's lips; benevolence
breathed from them as with the warmth of active exercise, and also a
little as with the bustle of haste.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Pocock, whom I left a quarter of an hour ago at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) hotel, has
asked me to mention to you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) would like to find you at home here
in about another hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) wants to see you; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) has something to
say--or considers, I believe, that you may have: so that I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
myself why she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) shouldn't come right round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) hasn't BEEN round
yet--to see our place; and I took upon myself to say that I was sure
you'd be glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>). The thing's therefore, you see, to keep
right here till she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>The announcement was sociably, even though, after Waymarsh's wont,
somewhat solemnly made; but Strether quickly felt other things in it
than these light features. It was the first approach, from that
quarter, to admitted consciousness; it quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pulse; it simply
meant at last that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) should have but himself to thank if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't
know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) breakfast; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pushed it away
and was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feet. There were plenty of elements of surprise, but
only one of doubt. <div class="bookquote">``The thing's for YOU to keep here too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>Waymarsh
had been slightly ambiguous.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wasn't ambiguous, however, after this enquiry; and Strether's
understanding had probably never before opened so wide and effective a
mouth as it was to open during the next five minutes. It was no part of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend's wish, as appeared, to help to receive Mrs. Pocock; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
quite understood the spirit in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was to present herself, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) connexion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) visit was limited to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) having--well, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
might say--perhaps a little promoted it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had thought, and had let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) know it, that Strether possibly would think she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) might have been
round before. At any rate, as turned out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had been wanting
herself, quite a while, to come. <div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>said Waymarsh, <div class="bookquote">``that it
would have been a bright idea if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had only carried it out before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether pronounced it so bright as to be almost dazzling. <div class="bookquote">``But why
HASn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) carried it out before? She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) has seen me every day--she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had
only to name her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) hour. I've been waiting and waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) you had. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) has been waiting too.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was, in
the oddest way in the world, on the showing of this tone, a genial new
pressing coaxing Waymarsh; a Waymarsh conscious with a different
consciousness from any he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had yet betrayed, and actually rendered by it
almost insinuating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lacked only time for full persuasion, and
Strether was to see in a moment why. Meantime, however, our friend
perceived, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was announcing a step of some magnanimity on Mrs.
Pocock's part, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could deprecate a sharp question. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
own high purpose in fact to have smoothed sharp questions to rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
looked his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) old comrade very straight in the eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had never
conveyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in so mute a manner so much kind confidence and so much
good advice. Everything that was between them was again in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face,
but matured and shelved and finally disposed of. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'s coming now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Considering how many pieces had to fit themselves, it all fell, in
Strether's brain, into a close rapid order. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw on the spot what
had happened, and what probably would yet; and it was all funny enough.
It was perhaps just this freedom of appreciation that wound him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) up to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) flare of high spirits. <div class="bookquote">``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) coming FOR?--to kill me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)'s coming to be very VERY kind to you, and you must let me say that
I greatly hope you'll not be less so to herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>This was spoken by Waymarsh with much gravity of admonition, and as
Strether stood there he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had but to make a movement to take the
attitude of a man gracefully receiving a present. The present was that
of the opportunity dear old Waymarsh had flattered himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had
divined in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the slight soreness of not having yet thoroughly
enjoyed; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had brought it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thus, as on a little silver
breakfast-tray, familiarly though delicately--without oppressive pomp;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to bend and smile and acknowledge, was to take and use and
be grateful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was not--that was the beauty of it--to be asked to
deflect too much from his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) dignity. No wonder the old boy bloomed in
this bland air of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own distillation. Strether felt for a moment as
if Sarah were actually walking up and down outside. Wasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hanging
about the porte-cochere while her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) friend thus summarily opened a way?
Strether would meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) but to take it, and everything would be for the
best in the best of possible worlds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never so much known what
any one meant as, in the light of this demonstration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew what Mrs.
Newsome did. It had reached Waymarsh from Sarah, but it had reached
Sarah from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother, and there was no break in the chain by which it
reached HIM. <div class="bookquote">``Has anything particular happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked after a
minute--<div class="bookquote">``so suddenly to determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) heard anything
unexpected from home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh, on this, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) harder than ever.
<div class="bookquote">''`Unexpected'?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had a brief hesitation; then, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was firm.
<div class="bookquote">``We're leaving Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leaving? That IS sudden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh showed a different opinion. <div class="bookquote">``Less so than it may seem. The
purpose of Mrs. Pocock's visit is to explain to you in fact that it's
NOT.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether didn't at all know if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had really an advantage--anything
that would practically count as one; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) enjoyed for the moment--as
for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) life--the sense of so carrying it off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
wondered--it was amusing--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt as the impudent feel. <div class="bookquote">``I shall
take great pleasure, I assure you, in any explanation. I shall be
delighted to receive Sarah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>comrade</b></font>)</div><p/>The sombre glow just darkened in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comrade's eyes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was struck
with the way it died out again. It was too mixed with another
consciousness--it was too smothered, as might be said, in flowers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
really for the time regretted it--poor dear old sombre glow! Something
straight and simple, something heavy and empty, had been eclipsed in
its company; something by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had best known his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend. Waymarsh
wouldn't BE his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend, somehow, without the occasional ornament of the
sacred rage, and the right to the sacred rage--inestimably precious for
Strether's charity--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) also seemed in a manner, and at Mrs. Pocock's
elbow, to have forfeited. Strether remembered the occasion early in
their stay when on that very spot he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had come out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) earnest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
ominous <div class="bookquote">``Quit it!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and, so remembering, felt it hang by a hair that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
didn't himself now utter the same note. Waymarsh was having a good
time--this was the truth that was embarrassing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was
having it then and there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was having it in Europe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was having it
under the very protection of circumstances of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) didn't in the
least approve; all of which placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in a false position, with no
issue possible--none at least by the grand manner. It was practically
in the manner of any one--it was all but in poor Strether's own--that
instead of taking anything up he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) merely made the most of having to be
himself explanatory. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not leaving for the United States direct.
Mr. and Mrs. Pocock and Miss Mamie are thinking of a little trip before
their own return, and we've been talking for some days past of our
joining forces. We've settled it that we do join and that we sail
together the end of next month. But we start to-morrow for Switzerland.
Mrs. Pocock wants some scenery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) hasn't had much yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was brave in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) way too, keeping nothing back, confessing all there
was, and only leaving Strether to make certain connexions. <div class="bookquote">``Is what
Mrs. Newsome had cabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) daughter an injunction to break off short?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The grand manner indeed at this just raised its head a little. <div class="bookquote">``I know
nothing about Mrs. Newsome's cables.''

 (<font color='red'><b>proportion</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes met on it with some intensity--during the few seconds of
which something happened quite out of proportion to the time. It
happened that Strether, looking thus at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend, didn't take his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
answer for truth--and that something more again occurred in consequence
of THAT. Yes--Waymarsh just DID know about Mrs. Newsome's cables: to
what other end than that had they dined together at Bignon's? Strether
almost felt for the instant that it was to Mrs. Newsome herself the
dinner had been given; and, for that matter, quite felt how she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) must
have known about it and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might think, protected and consecrated
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had a quick blurred view of daily cables, questions, answers,
signals: clear enough was his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) vision of the expense that, when so
wound up, the lady at home was prepared to incur. Vivid not less was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) memory of what, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) long observation of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), some of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
attainments of that high pitch had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Distinctly she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was at the
highest now, and Waymarsh, who imagined himself an independent
performer, was really, forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) fine old natural voice, an
overstrained accompanist. The whole reference of his (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) errand seemed to
mark her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) for Strether as by this time consentingly familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and
nothing yet had so despoiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) of a special shade of consideration.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``whether Sarah has been directed from home
to try me on the matter of my also going to Switzerland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>said Waymarsh as manfully as possible, <div class="bookquote">``nothing whatever
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) private affairs; though I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) to be acting in
conformity with things that have my highest respect.''  (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div>It was as manful
as possible, but it was still the false note--as it had to be to convey
so sorry a statement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew everything, Strether more and more felt,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thus disclaimed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) little punishment was just in this
doom to a second fib. What falser position--given the man--could the
most vindictive mind impose? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ended by squeezing through a passage in
which three months before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would certainly have stuck fast. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs
Pocock will probably be ready herself to answer any enquiry you may put
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>). But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``BUT--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faltered on it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what? Don't put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) too many?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh looked large, but the harm was done; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't, do what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would, help looking rosy. <div class="bookquote">``Don't do anything you'll be sorry for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It was an attenuation, Strether guessed, of something else that had
been on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lips; it was a sudden drop to directness, and was thereby
the voice of sincerity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had fallen to the supplicating note, and
that immediately, for our friend, made a difference and reinstated him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
They were in communication as they had been, that first morning, in
Sarah's salon and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) presence and Madame de Vionnet's; and the same
recognition of a great good will was again, after all, possible. Only
the amount of response Waymarsh had then taken for granted was doubled,
decupled now. This came out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) presently said: <div class="bookquote">``Of course I
needn't assure you I hope you'll come with us.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then it was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
implications and expectations loomed up for Strether as almost
pathetically gross.

<p/>The latter patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shoulder while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), giving the go-by
to the question of joining the Pococks; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) expressed the joy he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt at
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) go forth again so brave and free, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in fact almost took
leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) on the spot. <div class="bookquote">``I shall see you again of course before you
go; but I'm meanwhile much obliged to you for arranging so conveniently
for what you've told me. I shall walk up and down in the court
there--dear little old court which we've each bepaced so, this last
couple of months, to the tune of our flights and our drops, our
hesitations and our plunges: I shall hang about there, all impatience
and excitement, please let Sarah know, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) graciously presents
herself. Leave me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) without fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) laughed; <div class="bookquote">``I assure you I
shan't hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>). I don't think either she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'ll hurt ME: I'm in a
situation in which damage was some time ago discounted. Besides, THAT
isn't what worries you--but don't, don't explain! We're all right as we
are: which was the degree of success our adventure was pledged to for
each of us. We weren't, it seemed, all right as we were before; and
we've got over the ground, all things considered, quickly. I hope
you'll have a lovely time in the Alps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh fairly looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as from the foot of them. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know as I OUGHT really to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the conscience of Milrose in the very voice of Milrose, but, oh
it was feeble and flat! Strether suddenly felt quite ashamed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>);
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) breathed a greater boldness. <div class="bookquote">``LET yourself, on the contrary, go--in
all agreeable directions. These are precious hours--at our age they
mayn't recur. Don't have it to say to yourself at Milrose, next
winter, that you hadn't courage for them.''  (<font color='red'><b>comrade</b></font>)</div>And then as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comrade
queerly stared: <div class="bookquote">``Live up to Mrs. Pocock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>comrade</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Live up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a great help to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waymarsh/Mrs. Waymarsh</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh looked at it as at one of the uncomfortable things that were
certainly true and that it was yet ironical to say. <div class="bookquote">``It's more then
than you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's exactly your own chance and advantage. Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said
Strether, <div class="bookquote">``I do in my way contribute. I know what I'm about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Waymarsh had kept on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) great panama, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now stood nearer the
door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) last look beneath the shade of it had turned again to
darkness and warning. <div class="bookquote">``So do I! See here, Strether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I know what you're going to say. <div class="bookquote">``Quit this'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quit this!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But it lacked its old intensity; nothing of it remained;
it went out of the room with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>).



<p/>III


<p/>Almost the first thing, strangely enough, that, about an hour later,
Strether found himself doing in Sarah's presence was to remark
articulately on this failure, in their friend, of what had been
superficially his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) great distinction. It was as if--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) alluded of
course to the grand manner--the dear man had sacrificed it to some
other advantage; which would be of course only for himself to measure.
It might be simply that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was physically so much more sound than on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first coming out; this was all prosaic, comparatively cheerful and
vulgar. And fortunately, if one came to that, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) improvement in
health was really itself grander than any manner it could be conceived
as having cost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You yourself alone, dear Sarah'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether took
the plunge--<div class="bookquote">``have done him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), it strikes me, in these three weeks, as
much good as all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) time together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a plunge because somehow the range of reference was, in the
conditions, <div class="bookquote">``funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>and made funnier still by Sarah's attitude, by the
turn the occasion had, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) appearance, so sensibly taken. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
appearance was really indeed funnier than anything else--the spirit in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) to be there as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was there, the shade of
obscurity that cleared up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was seated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) in
the small salon de lecture that had, for the most part, in all the
weeks, witnessed the wane of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) early vivacity of discussion with
Waymarsh. It was an immense thing, quite a tremendous thing, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
to have come: this truth opened out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) having
already arrived for himself at a fairly vivid view of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had done
exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had given Waymarsh his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) word for--had walked and
re-walked the court while he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) advent; acquiring in this
exercise an amount of light that affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at the time as flooding
the scene. She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had decided upon the step in order to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the
benefit of a doubt, in order to be able to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) mother that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
had, even to abjectness, smoothed the way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). The doubt had been
as to whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mightn't take her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) as not having smoothed it--and the
admonition had possibly come from Waymarsh's more detached spirit.
Waymarsh had at any rate, certainly, thrown his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) weight into the
scale--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had pointed to the importance of depriving their friend of a
grievance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had done justice to the plea, and it was to set herself
right with a high ideal that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) actually sat there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) state. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
calculation was sharp in the immobility with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) tall
parasol-stick upright and at arm's length, quite as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had struck
the place to plant her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) flag; in the separate precautions she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) took not
to show as nervous; in the aggressive repose in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) did quite
nothing but wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). Doubt ceased to be possible from the moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had taken in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had arrived with no proposal whatever; that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) concern was simply to show what she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had come to receive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) had
come to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) submission, and Waymarsh was to have made it plain
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) would expect nothing less. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw fifty things, her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>)
host, at this convenient stage; but one of those he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) most saw was that
their anxious friend hadn't quite had the hand required of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
Waymarsh HAD, however, uttered the request that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) might find him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
mild, and while hanging about the court before her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
turned over with zeal the different ways in which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could be so. The
difficulty was that if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was mild he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wasn't, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) purpose,
conscious. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) conscious--as everything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) cried
aloud that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) did--she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) must accordingly be at costs to make him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so.
Conscious he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was, for himself--but only of too many things; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) must
choose the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) required.

<p/>Practically, however, it at last got itself named, and when once that
had happened they were quite at the centre of their situation. One
thing had really done as well as another; when Strether had spoken of
Waymarsh's leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and that had necessarily brought on a reference
to Mrs. Pocock's similar intention, the jump was but short to supreme
lucidity. Light became indeed after that so intense that Strether
would doubtless have but half made out, in the prodigious glare, by
which of the two the issue had been in fact precipitated. It was, in
their contracted quarters, as much there between them as if it had been
something suddenly spilled with a crash and a splash on the floor. The
form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) submission was to be an engagement to acquit himself within
the twenty-four hours. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll go in a moment if you give him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) the
word--he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) assures me on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) honour he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll do that'' (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>: this came in its
order, out of its order, in respect to Chad, after the crash had
occurred. It came repeatedly during the time taken by Strether to feel
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was even more fixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) rigour than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had supposed--the
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was not above adding to a little by telling her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) that such a way
of putting it on her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) brother's part left him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sufficiently surprised.
She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wasn't at all funny at last--she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was really fine; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) felt
easily where she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was strong--strong for herself. It hadn't yet so come
home to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was nobly and appointedly officious. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was
acting in interests grander and clearer than that of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) poor little
personal, poor little Parisian equilibrium, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) consciousness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mother's moral pressure profited by this proof of its sustaining
force. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would be held up; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would be strengthened; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) needn't in
the least be anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). What would once more have been distinct
to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) tried to make it so was that, as Mrs. Newsome was
essentially all moral pressure, the presence of this element was almost
identical with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) own presence. It wasn't perhaps that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
dealing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) straight, but it was certainly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had been
dealing straight with HIM. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) somehow by the
lengthened arm of the spirit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was having to that extent to take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) into account; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wasn't reaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) in turn, not making her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
take HIM; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was only reaching Sarah, who appeared to take so little of
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Something has clearly passed between you and Chad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) presently
said, <div class="bookquote">``that I think I ought to know something more about. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) put
it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``on me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you come out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``to put it all on HIM?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) replied to this no further than, after an instant, by saying:
<div class="bookquote">``Oh it's all right. Chad I mean's all right in having said to
you--well anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) may have said. I'll TAKE it all--what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) does
put on me. Only I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) before I see you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hesitated, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) brought it out. <div class="bookquote">``Is it absolutely necessary you
should see me again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, if I'm to give you any definite word about anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it your idea then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``that I shall keep on meeting you
only to be exposed to fresh humiliation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) a longer time. <div class="bookquote">``Are your instructions from Mrs. Newsome
that you shall, even at the worst, absolutely and irretrievably break
with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My instructions from Mrs. Newsome are, if you please, my affair. You
know perfectly what your own were, and you can judge for yourself of
what it can do for you to have made what you have of them. You can
perfectly see, at any rate, I'll go so far as to say, that if I wish
not to expose myself I must wish still less to expose HER.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had
already said more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had quite expected; but, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had also
pulled up, the colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) face showed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should from one moment
to the other have it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) now indeed felt the high importance of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
having it. <div class="bookquote">``What is your conduct,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) broke out as if to
explain--<div class="bookquote">``what is your conduct but an outrage to women like US? I mean
your acting as if there can be a doubt--as between us and such
another--of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) duty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thought a moment. It was rather much to deal with at once; not only
the question itself, but the sore abysses it revealed. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
they're totally different kinds of duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has any at all--to such another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to Madame de Vionnet?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) uttered the name not to affront
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), but yet again to gain time--time that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) needed for taking in
something still other and larger than her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) demand of a moment before. It
wasn't at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could see all that was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) actual challenge;
but when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) found himself just checking a low vague sound, a
sound which was perhaps the nearest approach his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) vocal chords had ever
known to a growl. Everything Mrs. Pocock had failed to give a sign of
recognising in Chad as a particular part of a
transformation--everything that had lent intention to this particular
failure--affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as gathered into a large loose bundle and thrown,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) words, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) face. The missile made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to that extent catch
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) breath; which however he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) presently recovered. <div class="bookquote">``Why when a woman's
at once so charming and so beneficent--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can sacrifice mothers and sisters to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) without a blush and can
make them cross the ocean on purpose to feel the more and take from you
the straighter, HOW you do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) up as short and as sharply as that, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) tried
not to flounder in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) grasp. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think there's anything I've
done in any such calculated way as you describe. Everything has come as
a sort of indistinguishable part of everything else. Your coming out
belonged closely to my having come before you, and my having come was a
result of our general state of mind. Our general state of mind had
proceeded, on its side, from our queer ignorance, our queer
misconceptions and confusions--from which, since then, an inexorable
tide of light seems to have floated us into our perhaps still queerer
knowledge. Don't you LIKE your brother as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``and
haven't you given your mother an intelligible account of all that that
comes to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It put to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) also, doubtless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own tone, too many things, this at
least would have been the case hadn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) final challenge directly
helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>). Everything, at the stage they had reached, directly helped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>), because everything betrayed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) such a basis of intention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
saw--the odd way things came out!--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would have been held less
monstrous had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) only been a little wilder. What exposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was just
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) poor old trick of quiet inwardness, what exposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
THINKING such offence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't in the least however the desire to
irritate that Sarah imputed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could only at last
temporise, for the moment, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) indignant view. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was altogether
more inflamed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had expected, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would probably understand
this better when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should learn what had occurred for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) with Chad.
Till then her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) particular blackness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) clear surprise at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) not clutching the pole she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) held out, must pass as extravagant. <div class="bookquote">``I
leave you to flatter yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) returned, ``that what you speak of
is what YOU``VE beautifully done. When a thing has been already
described in such a lovely way--!'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) caught herself up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
comment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) description rang out sufficiently loud. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
consider her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) even an apology for a decent woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah there it was at last! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) put the matter more crudely than, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
own mixed purposes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had yet had to do; but essentially it was all
one matter. It was so much--so much; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) treated it, poor lady, as
so little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) grew conscious, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was now apt to do, of a strange
smile, and the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) found himself talking like Miss Barrace.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has struck me from the first as wonderful. I've been thinking too
moreover that, after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would probably have represented even for
yourself something rather new and rather good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was to have given Mrs. Pocock with this, however, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) best
opportunity for a sound of derision. <div class="bookquote">``Rather new? I hope so with all
my heart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have affected you by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
exquisite amiability--a real revelation, it has seemed to myself; her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
high rarity, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) distinction of every sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been, with these words, consciously a little <div class="bookquote">``precious'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had had to be--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) couldn't give her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) the truth of the case without them;
and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) moreover now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't care. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had at all
events not served his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) cause, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) sprang at its exposed side. <div class="bookquote">``A
`revelation'--to ME: I've come to such a woman for a revelation? You
talk to me about `distinction'--YOU, you who've had your
privilege?--when the most distinguished woman we shall either of us
have seen in this world sits there insulted, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loneliness, by your
incredible comparison!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether forbore, with an effort, from straying; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) looked all
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Does your mother herself make the point that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sits
insulted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div><p/>Sarah's answer came so straight, so <div class="bookquote">``pat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>as might have been said,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) felt on the instant its origin. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has confided to my
judgement and my tenderness the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) personal sense of
everything, and the assertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) personal dignity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>They were the very words of the lady of Woollett--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would have known
them in a thousand; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) parting charge to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) child. Mrs. Pocock
accordingly spoke to this extent by book, and the fact immensely moved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does really feel as you say it's of course very very
dreadful. I've given sufficient proof, one would have thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``of my deep admiration for Mrs. Newsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray what proof would one have thought you'd CALL sufficient? That
of thinking this person here so far superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wondered again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) waited. <div class="bookquote">``Ah dear Sarah, you must LEAVE me this
person here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) desire to avoid all vulgar retorts, to show how, even
perversely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) rag of reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had softly almost wailed
this plea. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) knew it to be perhaps the most positive declaration
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had ever made in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) life, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) visitor's reception of it
virtually gave it that importance. <div class="bookquote">``That's exactly what I'm delighted
to do. God knows WE don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)! You take good care not to meet,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) observed in a still higher key, <div class="bookquote">``my question about their life. If
you do consider it a thing one can even SPEAK of, I congratulate you on
your taste!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The life she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) alluded to was of course Chad's and Madame de Vionnet's,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) thus bracketed together in a way that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) wince a
little; there being nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) but to take home her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) full
intention. It was none the less his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) inconsequence that while he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had
himself been enjoying for weeks the view of the brilliant woman's
specific action, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) just suffered from any characterisation of it by
other lips. <div class="bookquote">``I think tremendously well of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), at the same time that I
seem to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) `life' to be really none of my business. It's my
business, that is, only so far as Chad's own life is affected by it;
and what has happened, don't you see? is that Chad's has been affected
so beautifully. The proof of the pudding's in the eating'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) tried,
with no great success, to help it out with a touch of pleasantry, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) go on as if to sink and sink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) went on however well
enough, as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could do without fresh counsel; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) indeed
shouldn't stand quite firm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) felt, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) should have re-established
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) communications with Chad. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could always speak for the
woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had so definitely promised to <div class="bookquote">``save.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This wasn't quite for
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the air of salvation; but as that chill fairly deepened what did it
become but a reminder that one might at the worst perish WITH her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? And
it was simple enough--it was rudimentary: not, not to give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away.
<div class="bookquote">``I find in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) more merits than you would probably have patience with
my counting over. And do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) enquired, <div class="bookquote">``the effect you
produce on me by alluding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) in such terms? It's as if you had
some motive in not recognising all she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) has done for your brother, and
so shut your eyes to each side of the matter, in order, whichever side
comes up, to get rid of the other. I don't, you must allow me to say,
see how you can with any pretence to candour get rid of the side
nearest you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Near me--THAT sort of thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>And Sarah gave a jerk back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) head
that well might have nullified any active proximity.

<p/>It kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) friend himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) distance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) respected for a
moment the interval. Then with a last persuasive effort he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bridged it.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't, on your honour, appreciate Chad's fortunate development?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fortunate?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) echoed again. And indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was prepared. <div class="bookquote">``I call it
hideous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) departure had been for some minutes marked as imminent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was
already at the door that stood open to the court, from the threshold of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) delivered herself of this judgement. It rang out so loud as
to produce for the time the hush of everything else. Strether quite,
as an effect of it, breathed less bravely; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could acknowledge it, but
simply enough. <div class="bookquote">``Oh if you think THAT--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then all's at an end? So much the better. I do think that!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
passed out as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) spoke and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) way straight across the court,
beyond which, separated from them by the deep arch of the porte-cochere
the low victoria that had conveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) own hotel was drawn up.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) made for it with decision, and the manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) break, the sharp
shaft of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) rejoinder, had an intensity by which Strether was at first
kept in arrest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had let fly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as from a stretched cord, and
it took him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a minute to recover from the sense of being pierced. It
was not the penetration of surprise; it was that, much more, of
certainty; his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) case being put for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had as yet only put it to
himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was away at any rate; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had distanced him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--with rather
a grand spring, an effect of pride and ease, after all; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had got
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) carriage before he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), and the vehicle was
already in motion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stopped halfway; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stood there in the court
only seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) go and noting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) no other look. The way
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had put it to himself was that all quite MIGHT be at an end. Each
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) movements, in this resolute rupture, reaffirmed, re-enforced
that idea. Sarah passed out of sight in the sunny street while, planted
there in the centre of the comparatively grey court, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued
merely to look before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). It probably WAS all at an end.

<p/>I


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went late that evening to the Boulevard Malesherbes, having his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
impression that it would be vain to go early, and having also, more
than once in the course of the day, made enquiries of the concierge.
Chad hadn't come in and had left no intimation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had affairs,
apparently, at this juncture--as it occurred to Strether he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) so well
might have--that kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) long abroad. Our friend asked once for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
at the hotel in the Rue de Rivoli, but the only contribution offered
there was the fact that every one was out. It was with the idea that
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would have to come home to sleep that Strether went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) rooms,
from which however he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was still absent, though, from the balcony, a few
moments later, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) visitor heard eleven o'clock strike. Chad's servant
had by this time answered for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) reappearance; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) HAD, the visitor
learned, come quickly in to dress for dinner and vanish again. Strether
spent an hour in waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--an hour full of strange suggestions,
persuasions, recognitions; one of those that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to recall, at the
end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) adventure, as the particular handful that most had counted.
The mellowest lamplight and the easiest chair had been placed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
disposal by Baptiste, subtlest of servants; the novel half-uncut, the
novel lemon-coloured and tender, with the ivory knife athwart it like
the dagger in a contadina's hair, had been pushed within the soft
circle--a circle which, for some reason, affected Strether as softer
still after the same Baptiste had remarked that in the absence of a
further need of anything by Monsieur he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would betake himself to bed.
The night was hot and heavy and the single lamp sufficient; the great
flare of the lighted city, rising high, spending itself afar, played up
from the Boulevard and, through the vague vista of the successive
rooms, brought objects into view and added to their dignity. Strether
found himself in possession as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) never yet had been; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been there
alone, had turned over books and prints, had invoked, in Chad's
absence, the spirit of the place, but never at the witching hour and
never with a relish quite so like a pang.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) spent a long time on the balcony; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hung over it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had seen
little Bilham hang the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) first approach, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had seen Mamie
hang over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) own the day little Bilham himself might have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)
from below; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) passed back into the rooms, the three that occupied the
front and that communicated by wide doors; and, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) circulated and
rested, tried to recover the impression that they had made on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) three
months before, to catch again the voice in which they had seemed then
to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>). That voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had to note, failed audibly to sound;
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) took as the proof of all the change in himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had heard,
of old, only what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) COULD then hear; what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) could do now was to think
of three months ago as a point in the far past. All voices had grown
thicker and meant more things; they crowded on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) moved
about--it was the way they sounded together that wouldn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) be
still. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) felt, strangely, as sad as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had come for some wrong,
and yet as excited as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had come for some freedom. But the freedom
was what was most in the place and the hour, it was the freedom that
most brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) round again to the youth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) own that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had long
ago missed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) could have explained little enough to-day either why he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
had missed it or why, after years and years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) should care that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
had; the main truth of the actual appeal of everything was none the
less that everything represented the substance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) loss put it
within reach, within touch, made it, to a degree it had never been, an
affair of the senses. That was what it became for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) at this singular
time, the youth he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had long ago missed--a queer concrete presence, full
of mystery, yet full of reality, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) could handle, taste, smell,
the deep breathing of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) could positively hear. It was in the
outside air as well as within; it was in the long watch, from the
balcony, in the summer night, of the wide late life of Paris, the
unceasing soft quick rumble, below, of the little lighted carriages
that, in the press, always suggested the gamblers he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had seen of old at
Monte Carlo pushing up to the tables. This image was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) at last became aware that Chad was behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tells me you put it all on ME'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had arrived after this promptly
enough at that information; which expressed the case however quite as
the young man appeared willing for the moment to leave it. Other
things, with this advantage of their virtually having the night before
them, came up for them, and had, as well, the odd effect of making the
occasion, instead of hurried and feverish, one of the largest, loosest
and easiest to which Strether's whole adventure was to have treated
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been pursuing Chad from an early hour and had overtaken
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) only now; but now the delay was repaired by their being so
exceptionally confronted. They had foregathered enough of course in
all the various times; they had again and again, since that first night
at the theatre, been face to face over their question; but they had
never been so alone together as they were actually alone--their talk
hadn't yet been so supremely for themselves. And if many things
moreover passed before them, none passed more distinctly for Strether
than that striking truth about Chad of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been so often moved
to take note: the truth that everything came happily back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) knowing how to live. It had been seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) pleased smile--a
smile that pleased exactly in the right degree--as his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) visitor turned
round, on the balcony, to greet his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) advent; his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) visitor in fact felt on
the spot that there was nothing their meeting would so much do as bear
witness to that facility. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) surrendered himself accordingly to so
approved a gift; for what was the meaning of the facility but that
others DID surrender themselves? He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) didn't want, luckily, to prevent
Chad from living; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was quite aware that even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would
himself have thoroughly gone to pieces. It was in truth essentially by
bringing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) personal life to a function all subsidiary to the
young man's own that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) held together. And the great point, above all,
the sign of how completely Chad possessed the knowledge in question,
was that one thus became, not only with a proper cheerfulness, but with
wild native impulses, the feeder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) stream. Their talk had
accordingly not lasted three minutes without Strether's feeling basis
enough for the excitement in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had waited. This overflow fairly
deepened, wastefully abounded, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) observed the smallness of anything
corresponding to it on the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend. That was exactly this
friend's happy case; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``put out''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) excitement, or whatever other
emotion the matter involved, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) washing; than which no
arrangement could make more for domestic order. It was quite for
Strether himself in short to feel a personal analogy with the laundress
bringing home the triumphs of the mangle.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had reported on Sarah's visit, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) did very fully, Chad
answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) question with perfect candour. <div class="bookquote">``I positively referred her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
to you--told her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) must absolutely see you. This was last night, and
it all took place in ten minutes. It was our first free talk--really
the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had tackled me. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew I also knew what her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) line
had been with yourself; knew moreover how little you had been doing to
make anything difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). So I spoke for you frankly--assured
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) you were all at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) service. I assured her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) I was too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young
man continued; <div class="bookquote">``and I pointed out how she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could perfectly, at any time,
have got at me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) difficulty has been simply her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) not finding the
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) fancied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) difficulty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether returned, <div class="bookquote">``has been simply that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) finds
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s afraid of you. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s not afraid of ME, Sarah, one little scrap;
and it was just because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) has seen how I can fidget when I give my
mind to it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) has felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) best chance, rightly enough to be in
making me as uneasy as possible. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s at bottom as pleased to
HAVE you put it on me as you yourself can possibly be to put it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what in the world, my dear man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad enquired in objection to
this luminosity, <div class="bookquote">``have I done to make Sally afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been `wonderful, wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>as we say--we poor people who
watch the play from the pit; and that's what has, admirably, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).
Made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) all the more effectually that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) could see you didn't set
about it on purpose--I mean set about affecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) as with fear.''

<p/>Chad cast a pleasant backward glance over his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) possibilities of motive.
<div class="bookquote">``I've only wanted to be kind and friendly, to be decent and
attentive--and I still only want to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether smiled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) comfortable clearness. <div class="bookquote">``Well, there can
certainly be no way for it better than by my taking the onus. It
reduces your personal friction and your personal offence to almost
nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah but Chad, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) completer conception of the friendly, wouldn't
quite have this! They had remained on the balcony, where, after their
day of great and premature heat, the midnight air was delicious; and
they leaned back in turn against the balustrade, all in harmony with
the chairs and the flower-pots, the cigarettes and the starlight. <div class="bookquote">``The
onus isn't REALLY yours--after our agreeing so to wait together and
judge together. That was all my answer to Sally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad pursued--<div class="bookquote">``that
we have been, that we are, just judging together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of the burden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether explained; <div class="bookquote">``I haven't come in
the least that you should take it off me. I've come very much, it
seems to me, to double up my fore legs in the manner of the camel when
he (<font color='blue'><b>yours</b></font>) gets down on his (<font color='blue'><b>yours</b></font>) knees to make his (<font color='blue'><b>yours</b></font>) back convenient. But I've
supposed you all this while to have been doing a lot of special and
private judging--about which I haven't troubled you; and I've only
wished to have your conclusion first from you. I don't ask more than
that; I'm quite ready to take it as it has come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) face to the sky with a slow puff of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) smoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I've seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether waited a little. <div class="bookquote">``I've left you wholly alone; haven't, I
think I may say, since the first hour or two--when I merely preached
patience--so much as breathed on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you've been awfully good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've both been good then--we've played the game. We've given them
the most liberal conditions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad conditions</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``splendid conditions! It was open to them, open to
them'' (<font color='red'><b>Chad conditions</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) seemed to make it out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) smoked, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) eyes still on
the stars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might in quiet sport have been reading their horoscope.
Strether wondered meanwhile what had been open to them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) finally
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) have it. <div class="bookquote">``It was open to them simply to let me alone; to have
made up their minds, on really seeing me for themselves, that I could
go on well enough as I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether assented to this proposition with full lucidity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
companion's plural pronoun, which stood all for Mrs. Newsome and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
daughter, having no ambiguity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). There was nothing, apparently,
to stand for Mamie and Jim; and this added to our friend's sense of
Chad's knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thought. ``But they've made up their minds to
the opposite--that you CAN<div class="bookquote">``T go on as you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad continued in the same way; <div class="bookquote">``they won't have it for a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) side also reflectively smoked. It was as if their high
place really represented some moral elevation from which they could
look down on their recent past. <div class="bookquote">``There never was the smallest chance,
do you know, that they WOULD have it for a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not--no real chance. But if they were willing to think
there was--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They weren't willing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether had worked it all out. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't for
you they came out, but for me. It wasn't to see for themselves what
you're doing, but what I'm doing. The first branch of their curiosity
was inevitably destined, under my culpable delay, to give way to the
second; and it's on the second that, if I may use the expression and
you don't mind my marking the invidious fact, they've been of late
exclusively perched. When Sarah sailed it was me, in other words, they
were after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad took it in both with intelligence and with indulgence. <div class="bookquote">``It IS
rather a business then--what I've let you in for!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had again a brief pause; which ended in a reply that seemed to
dispose once for all of this element of compunction. Chad was to treat
it, at any rate, so far as they were again together, as having done so.
<div class="bookquote">``I was `in' when you found me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but it was you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man laughed, <div class="bookquote">``who found ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only found you out. It was you who found me in. It was all in the
day's work for them, at all events, that they should come. And they've
greatly enjoyed it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've tried to make them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion did himself presently the same justice. <div class="bookquote">``So have I. I
tried even this very morning--while Mrs. Pocock was with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
enjoys for instance, almost as much as anything else, not being, as
I've said, afraid of me; and I think I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) help in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad took a deeper interest. <div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) very very nasty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether debated. <div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was the most important thing--she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was
definite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) was--at last--crystalline. And I felt no remorse. I saw
that they must have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I wanted to see them for myself; so that if it were only for
THAT--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad's own remorse was as small.

<p/>This appeared almost all Strether wanted. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't your having seen them
for yourself then THE thing, beyond all others, that has come of their
visit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thought it nice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) old friend to put it so.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you count it as anything that you're dished--if you ARE dished?
Are you, my dear man, dished?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) were asking if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had caught cold or hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) foot,
and Strether for a minute but smoked and smoked. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>)
again. I must see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you must.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Then Chad hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean--a--Mother
herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh your mother--that will depend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as if Mrs. Newsome had somehow been placed by the words very far
off. Chad however endeavoured in spite of this to reach the place.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you mean it will depend on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether, for all answer, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a longish look. <div class="bookquote">``I was speaking of
Sarah. I must positively--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) quite cast me off--see HER again.
I can't part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was awfully unpleasant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Strether exhaled. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) had to be. I mean that from
the moment they're not delighted they can only be--well what I admit
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was. We gave them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``their chance to be delighted, and
they've walked up to it, and looked all round it, and not taken it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can bring a horse to water--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely. And the tune to which this morning Sarah wasn't
delighted--the tune to which, to adopt your metaphor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) refused to
drink--leaves us on that side nothing more to hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad had a pause, and then as if consolingly: <div class="bookquote">``It was never of course
really the least on the cards that they would be `delighted.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether mused. <div class="bookquote">``I've had to come as
far round. However'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) shook it off--<div class="bookquote">``it's doubtless MY performance
that's absurd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are certainly moments,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``when you seem to me too good
to be true. Yet if you are true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that seems to be all that
need concern me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm true, but I'm incredible. I'm fantastic and ridiculous--I don't
explain myself even TO myself. How can they then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether asked,
<div class="bookquote">``understand me? So I don't quarrel with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. They quarrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad rather comfortably, <div class="bookquote">``with US.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Strether noted once more the comfort, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) young friend had already
gone on. <div class="bookquote">``I should feel greatly ashamed, all the same, if I didn't put
it before you again that you ought to think, after all, tremendously
well. I mean before giving up beyond recall--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With which insistence,
as from a certain delicacy, dropped.

<p/>Ah but Strether wanted it. <div class="bookquote">``Say it all, say it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, at your age, and with what--when all's said and done--Mother
might do for you and be for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad had said it all, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) natural scruple, only to that extent; so
that Strether after an instant himself took a hand. <div class="bookquote">``My absence of an
assured future. The little I have to show toward the power to take
care of myself. The way, the wonderful way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would certainly take
care of me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) fortune, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) kindness, and the constant miracle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
having been disposed to go even so far. Of course, of course'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
summed it up. <div class="bookquote">``There are those sharp facts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad had meanwhile thought of another still. <div class="bookquote">``And don't you really
care--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) friend slowly turned round to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Will you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go if you'll say you now consider I should. You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) went
on, <div class="bookquote">``I was ready six weeks ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``that was when you didn't know I wasn't! You're
ready at present because you do know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad returned; <div class="bookquote">``but all the same I'm sincere. You talk
about taking the whole thing on your shoulders, but in what light do
you regard me that you think me capable of letting you pay?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Strether
patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) arm, as they stood together against the parapet,
reassuringly--seeming to wish to contend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) HAD the wherewithal;
but it was again round this question of purchase and price that the
young man's sense of fairness continued to hover. <div class="bookquote">``What it literally
comes to for you, if you'll pardon my putting it so, is that you give
up money. Possibly a good deal of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether laughed, <div class="bookquote">``if it were only just enough you'd still be
justified in putting it so! But I've on my side to remind you too that
YOU give up money; and more than `possibly'--quite certainly, as I
should suppose--a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True enough; but I've got a certain quantity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad returned after a
moment. <div class="bookquote">``Whereas you, my dear man, you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't be at all said'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether took him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) up--<div class="bookquote">``to have a `quantity'
certain or uncertain? Very true. Still, I shan't starve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you mustn't STARVE!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad pacifically emphasised; and so, in the
pleasant conditions, they continued to talk; though there was, for that
matter, a pause in which the younger companion might have been taken as
weighing again the delicacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) then and there promising the elder
some provision against the possibility just mentioned. This, however,
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) presumably thought best not to do, for at the end of another minute
they had moved in quite a different direction. Strether had broken in
by returning to the subject of Chad's passage with Sarah and enquiring
if they had arrived, in the event, at anything in the nature of a
<div class="bookquote">``scene.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah/Sarah Pocock/Pocock</b></font>)</div>To this Chad replied that they had on the contrary kept
tremendously polite; adding moreover that Sally was after all not the
woman to have made the mistake of not being. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hands are a good
deal tied, you see. I got so, from the first,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sagaciously
observed, <div class="bookquote">``the start of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has taken so much from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I couldn't of course in common decency give less: only she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
hadn't expected, I think, that I'd give her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) nearly so much. And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
began to take it before she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) began to like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) began to
take it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has liked it--also more than she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) expected.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>After which Chad
observed: <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't like ME. In fact she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hates me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's interest grew. <div class="bookquote">``Then why does she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) want you at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because when you hate you want to triumph, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) should get me
neatly stuck there she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) WOULD triumph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether followed afresh, but looking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly--in a
manner. But it would scarce be a triumph worth having if, once
entangled, feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) dislike and possibly conscious in time of a
certain quantity of your own, you should on the spot make yourself
unpleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can bear ME--could bear me at least at home. It's
my being there that would be her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) triumph. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hates me in Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hates in other words--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, THAT``S it!''--Chad had quickly understood this understanding;
which formed on the part of each as near an approach as they had yet
made to naming Madame de Vionnet. The limitations of their
distinctness didn't, however, prevent its fairly lingering in the air
that it was this lady Mrs. Pocock hated. It added one more touch
moreover to their established recognition of the rare intimacy of
Chad's association with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had never yet more twitched away the
last light veil from this phenomenon than in presenting himself as
confounded and submerged in the feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocock</b></font>) had created at Woollett.
<div class="bookquote">``And I'll tell you who hates me too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) immediately went on.

<p/>Strether knew as immediately whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) meant, but with as prompt a
protest. <div class="bookquote">``Ah no! Mamie doesn't hate--well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) caught himself in
time--<div class="bookquote">``anybody at all. Mamie's beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``That's just why I mind it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) certainly
doesn't like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much do you mind it? What would you do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'd like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mamie</b></font>)'d like me. Really, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad declared.

<p/>It gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion a moment's pause. <div class="bookquote">``You asked me just now if I
don't, as you said, `care' about a certain person. You rather tempt me
therefore to put the question in my turn. Don't YOU care about a
certain other person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hard in the lamplight of the window. <div class="bookquote">``The
difference is that I don't want to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wondered. <div class="bookquote">''`Don't want' to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I try not to--that is I HAVE tried. I've done my best. You can't be
surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man easily went on, <div class="bookquote">``when you yourself set me on
it. I was indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``already on it a little; but you set me
harder. It was six weeks ago that I thought I had come out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether took it well in. <div class="bookquote">``But you haven't come out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--it's what I WANT to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>said Chad. <div class="bookquote">``And if I could
have sufficiently wanted--by myself--to go back, I think I might have
found out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly'' (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>--Strether considered. <div class="bookquote">``But all you were able to achieve was
to want to want to! And even then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``only till our friends
there came. Do you want to want to still?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As with a sound
half-dolorous, half-droll and all vague and equivocal, Chad buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
face for a little in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hands, rubbing it in a whimsical way that
amounted to an evasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) brought it out more sharply: <div class="bookquote">``DO you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad kept for a time his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) attitude, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) looked up, and then
abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``Jim IS a damned dose!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) declared.

<p/>``Oh I don't ask you to abuse or describe or in any way pronounce on
your relatives; I simply put it to you once more whether you're NOW
ready. You say you've ``seen.<div class="bookquote">'' Is what you've seen that you can't
resist?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a strange smile--the nearest approach he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had ever shown
to a troubled one. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you make me NOT resist?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What it comes to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on very gravely now and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
hadn't heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what it comes to is that more has been done for you,
I think, than I've ever seen done--attempted perhaps, but never so
successfully done--by one human being for another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh an immense deal certainly'' (<font color='red'><b>deal Chad</b></font>)</div>--Chad did it full justice. <div class="bookquote">``And you
yourself are adding to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>It was without heeding this either that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) visitor continued. <div class="bookquote">``And our
friends there won't have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they simply won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They demand you on the basis, as it were, of repudiation and
ingratitude; and what has been the matter with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether went on,
<div class="bookquote">``is that I haven't seen my way to working with you for repudiation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad appreciated this. <div class="bookquote">``Then as you haven't seen yours you naturally
haven't seen mine. There it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) proceeded, with a
certain abruptness, to a sharp interrogation. <div class="bookquote">``NOW do you say she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
doesn't hate me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">''`She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)'--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--Mother. We called it Sarah, but it comes to the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether objected, <div class="bookquote">``not to the same thing as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hating YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>On which--though as if for an instant it had hung fire--Chad remarkably
replied: <div class="bookquote">``Well, if they hate my good friend, THAT comes to the same
thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>It had a note of inevitable truth that made Strether take it as
enough, feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted nothing more. The young man spoke in it for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``good friend''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever yet directly spoken, confessed to
such deep identities between them as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might play with the idea of
working free from, but which at a given moment could still draw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
down like a whirlpool. And meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone on. <div class="bookquote">``Their hating
you too moreover--that also comes to a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``your mother doesn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad, however, loyally stuck to it--loyally, that is, to Strether. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
will if you don't look out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I do look out. I am, after all, looking out. That's just why,''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>our friend explained, <div class="bookquote">``I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>It drew from Chad again the same question. <div class="bookquote">``To see Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see--for the present--Sarah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then there you are! And what I don't for the life of me make out,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad pursued with resigned perplexity, <div class="bookquote">``is what you GAIN by it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh it would have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion too long to say! <div class="bookquote">``That's because
you have, I verily believe, no imagination. You've other qualities.
But no imagination, don't you see? at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say. I do see.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>It was an idea in which Chad showed interest.
<div class="bookquote">``But haven't you yourself rather too much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh RATHER--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>So that after an instant, under this reproach and as if
it were at last a fact really to escape from, Strether made his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) move
for departure.



<p/>II


<p/>One of the features of the restless afternoon passed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) after Mrs.
Pocock's visit was an hour spent, shortly before dinner, with Maria
Gostrey, whom of late, in spite of so sustained a call on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) attention
from other quarters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had by no means neglected. And that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was
still not neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) will appear from the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
again at the same hour on the very morrow--with no less fine a
consciousness moreover of being able to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) ear. It continued
inveterately to occur, for that matter, that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had taken one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) greater turns he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came back to where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) so faithfully awaited
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). None of these excursions had on the whole been livelier than the
pair of incidents--the fruit of the short interval since his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) previous
visit--on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had now to report to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had seen Chad Newsome
late the night before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had had that morning, as a sequel to this
conversation, a second interview with Sarah. <div class="bookquote">``But they're all off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``All?--Mr. Newsome with them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah not yet! Sarah and Jim and Mamie. But Waymarsh with them--for
Sarah. It's too beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether continued; <div class="bookquote">``I find I don't get
over that--it's always a fresh joy. But it's a fresh joy too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``that--well, what do you think? Little Bilham also goes. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
of course goes for Mamie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey wondered. <div class="bookquote">''`For' her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)? Do you mean they're already
engaged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, ``say then for ME. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)'ll do anything for me;
just as I will, for that matter--anything I can--for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>). Or for Mamie
either. SHE<div class="bookquote">``LL do anything for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey gave a comprehensive sigh. <div class="bookquote">``The way you reduce people to
subjection!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's certainly, on one side, wonderful. But it's quite equalled, on
another, by the way I don't. I haven't reduced Sarah, since yesterday;
though I've succeeded in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) again, as I'll presently tell you.
The others however are really all right. Mamie, by that blessed law of
ours, absolutely must have a young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what must poor Mr. Bilham have? Do you mean they'll MARRY for
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that, by the same blessed law, it won't matter a grain if they
don't--I shan't have in the least to worry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) saw as usual what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) meant. <div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Jim?--who goes for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether had to admit, <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't manage THAT. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s thrown, as
usual, on the world; the world which, after all, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) account--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
has prodigious adventures--seems very good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
fortunately--`over here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) says--finds the world everywhere; and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) most prodigious adventure of all,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``has been of course
of the last few days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey, already knowing, instantly made the connexion. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) has
seen Marie de Vionnet again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) went, all by himself, the day after Chad's party--didn't I tell
you?--to tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). By her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) invitation--all alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite like yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s more wonderful about her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) than I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>And then as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
friend showed how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could believe it, filling it out, fitting it on
to old memories of the wonderful woman: <div class="bookquote">``What I should have liked to
manage would have been HER going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Switzerland with the party?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For Jim--and for symmetry. If it had been workable moreover for a
fortnight she (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)'d have gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)'s ready'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) followed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) renewed
vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``for anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a minute. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)'s too perfect!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) WILL, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``go to-night to the station.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With Chad--marvellously--as part of their general attention. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
does it'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--it kept before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``with a light, light grace, a free, free
gaiety, that may well softly bewilder Mr. Pocock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) so before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion had after an instant a
friendly comment. <div class="bookquote">``As in short it has softly bewildered a saner man.
Are you really in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria threw off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's of no importance I should know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``It matters so
little--has nothing to do, practically, with either of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same'' (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>--Maria continued to smile--<div class="bookquote">``they go, the five, as I
understand you, and you and Madame de Vionnet stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh and Chad.''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>To which Strether added: <div class="bookquote">``And you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah `me'!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) gave a small impatient wail again, in which something
of the unreconciled seemed suddenly to break out. <div class="bookquote">``I don't stay, it
somehow seems to me, much to my advantage. In the presence of all you
cause to pass before me I've a tremendous sense of privation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``But your privation, your keeping out of
everything, has been--hasn't it?--by your own choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; it has been necessary--that is it has been better for you.
What I mean is only that I seem to have ceased to serve you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you tell that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know how you serve me.
When you cease--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) dropped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll LET you know. Be quiet till then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thought a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Then you positively like me to stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I treat you as if I did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're certainly very kind to me. But that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>said Maria, <div class="bookquote">``is for
myself. It's getting late, as you see, and Paris turning rather hot
and dusty. People are scattering, and some of them, in other places
want me. But if you want me here--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had spoken as resigned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) word, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had of a sudden a still
sharper sense than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have expected of desiring not to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I want you here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) took it as if the words were all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had wished; as if they brought
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) something that was the compensation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) case. <div class="bookquote">``Thank
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) simply answered. And then as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) a little
harder, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>It had broken as with a slight arrest into the current of their talk,
and it held him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a moment longer. <div class="bookquote">``Why, two months, or whatever the
time was, ago, did you so suddenly dash off? The reason you afterwards
gave me for having kept away three weeks wasn't the real one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) recalled. <div class="bookquote">``I never supposed you believed it was. Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``if you didn't guess it that was just what helped you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) on this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) indulged, so far as space
permitted, in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) slow absences. <div class="bookquote">``I've often thought of it, but
never to feel that I could guess it. And you see the consideration
with which I've treated you in never asking till now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then why DO you ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To show you how I miss you when you're not here, and what it does for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't seem to have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``all it might! However,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``if you've really never guessed the truth I'll tell it you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never guessed it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then I dashed off, as you say, so as not to have the confusion of
being there if Marie de Vionnet should tell you anything to my
detriment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) considerably doubted. <div class="bookquote">``You even then would have had
to face it on your return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh if I had found reason to believe it something very bad I'd have
left you altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``it was only on guessing she (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had been on the
whole merciful that you ventured back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria kept it together. <div class="bookquote">``I owe her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) thanks. Whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) temptation
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) didn't separate us. That's one of my reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) went on <div class="bookquote">``for
admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it pass then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``for one of mine as well. But what
would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) temptation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are ever the temptations of women?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) thought--but hadn't, naturally, to think too long. <div class="bookquote">``Men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) would have had you, with it, more for herself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
could have you without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh `have' me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether a trifle ambiguously sighed. <div class="bookquote">``YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
handsomely declared, <div class="bookquote">``would have had me at any rate WITH it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh `have' you!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) echoed it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had done. <div class="bookquote">``I do have you,
however,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) less ironically said, <div class="bookquote">``from the moment you express a
wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stopped before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), full of the disposition. <div class="bookquote">``I'll express fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Which indeed begot in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), with a certain inconsequence, a return of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) small wail. <div class="bookquote">``Ah there you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There, if it were so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued for the rest of the time to be, and
it was as if to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could still serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that, coming
back to the departure of the Pococks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) the view, vivid with
a hundred more touches than we can reproduce, of what had happened for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had had ten minutes with Sarah at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hotel, ten
minutes reconquered, by irresistible pressure, from the time over which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had already described her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) to Miss Gostrey as having, at the end of
their interview on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own premises, passed the great sponge of the
future. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) by not announcing himself, had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) sitting-room with a dressmaker and a lingere whose accounts she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
appeared to have been more or less ingenuously settling and who soon
withdrew. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had succeeded, late the
night before, in keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) promise of seeing Chad. <div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) I'd
take it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd `take' it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) doesn't go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria waited. <div class="bookquote">``And who takes it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) does?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) enquired with a
certain grimness of gaiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``I think I take, in any event, everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By which I suppose you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion brought out after a
moment, <div class="bookquote">``that you definitely understand you now lose everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``It does come perhaps to the same thing.
But Chad, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has seen, doesn't really want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could believe that, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) made, as always, for clearness. <div class="bookquote">``Still,
what, after all, HAS he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) seen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What they want of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). And it's enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It contrasts so unfavourably with what Madame de Vionnet wants?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It contrasts--just so; all round, and tremendously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore, perhaps, most of all with what YOU want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``what I want is a thing I've ceased to measure or
even to understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend none the less went on. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want Mrs. Newsome--after
such a way of treating you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a straighter mode of dealing with this lady than they had as
yet--such was their high form--permitted themselves; but it seemed not
wholly for this that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) delayed a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say it has been,
after all, the only way she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) could have imagined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And does that make you want her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) any more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've tremendously disappointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether thought it worth while
to mention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you have. That's rudimentary; that was plain to us long
ago. But isn't it almost as plain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria went on, <div class="bookquote">``that you've even
yet your straight remedy? Really drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) away, as I believe you still
can, and you'd cease to have to count with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) disappointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``I should have to count with yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But this barely struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) now. <div class="bookquote">``What, in that case, should you call
counting? You haven't come out where you are, I think, to please ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) insisted, <div class="bookquote">``that too, you know, has been part of it. I can't
separate--it's all one; and that's perhaps why, as I say, I don't
understand.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was ready to declare again that this didn't in the
least matter; all the more that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) affirmed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) HADn't really as
yet <div class="bookquote">``come out.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) gives me after all, on its coming to the pinch, a
last mercy, another chance. They don't sail, you see, for five or six
weeks more, and they haven't--she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) admits that--expected Chad would take
part in their tour. It's still open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to join them, at the last,
at Liverpool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey considered. <div class="bookquote">``How in the world is it `open' unless you
open it? How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) join them at Liverpool if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) but sinks deeper into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) situation here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)--as I explained to you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) let me know
yesterday--his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) word of honour to do as I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria stared. <div class="bookquote">``But if you say nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as usual walked about on it. <div class="bookquote">``I did say something this
morning. I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) my answer--the word I had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) after
hearing from himself what HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had promised. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) demanded of me
yesterday, you'll remember, was the engagement then and there to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) take up this vow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey enquired, <div class="bookquote">``was the purpose of your visit to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) only to decline?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it was to ask, odd as that may seem to you, for another delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah that's weak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had spoken with impatience, but, so far as that at
least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was. <div class="bookquote">``If I AM weak I want to find it out. If
I don't find it out I shall have the comfort, the little glory, of
thinking I'm strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all the comfort, I judge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``that you WILL have!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it will have been a month more. Paris may
grow, from day to day, hot and dusty, as you say; but there are other
things that are hotter and dustier. I'm not afraid to stay on; the
summer here must be amusing in a wild--if it isn't a tame--way of its
own; the place at no time more picturesque. I think I shall like it.
And then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) benevolently smiled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``there will be always you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) objected, <div class="bookquote">``it won't be as a part of the picturesqueness that
I shall stay, for I shall be the plainest thing about you. You may, you
see, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``have nobody else. Madame de Vionnet
may very well be going off, mayn't she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?--and Mr. Newsome by the same
stroke: unless indeed you've had an assurance from them to the
contrary. So that if your idea's to stay for them'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) duty to
suggest it--<div class="bookquote">``you may be left in the lurch. Of course if they do
stay'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kept it up--<div class="bookquote">``they would be part of the picturesqueness. Or
else indeed you might join them somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether seemed to face it as if it were a happy thought; but the next
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke more critically. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that they'll probably go
off together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) just considered. <div class="bookquote">``I think it will be treating you quite without
ceremony if they do; though after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``it would be
difficult to see now quite what degree of ceremony properly meets your
case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether conceded, <div class="bookquote">``my attitude toward them is
extraordinary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so; so that one may ask one's self what style of proceeding on
their own part can altogether match it. The attitude of their own that
won't pale in its light they've doubtless still to work out. The
really handsome thing perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) presently threw off, <div class="bookquote">``WOULD be for
them to withdraw into more secluded conditions, offering at the same
time to share them with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), on this, as if some
generous irritation--all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interest--had suddenly again flickered
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>); and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) next said indeed half-explained it. <div class="bookquote">``Don't really
be afraid to tell me if what now holds you IS the pleasant prospect of
the empty town, with plenty of seats in the shade, cool drinks,
deserted museums, drives to the Bois in the evening, and our wonderful
woman all to yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kept it up still more. <div class="bookquote">``The handsomest
thing of ALL, when one makes it out, would, I dare say, be that Mr.
Chad should for a while go off by himself. It's a pity, from that
point of view,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) doesn't pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother a visit.
It would at least occupy your interval.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The thought in fact held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) a
moment. <div class="bookquote">``Why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother a visit? Even a week, at this
good moment, would do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether replied--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had it even to himself
surprisingly ready--<div class="bookquote">``my dear lady, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother has paid HIM a visit.
Mrs. Newsome has been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), this month, with an intensity that I'm
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has thoroughly felt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has lavishly entertained her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
has let him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) thanks. Do you suggest he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) shall go back for more
of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) succeeded after a little in shaking it off. <div class="bookquote">``I see. It's
what you don't suggest--what you haven't suggested. And you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So would you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) kindly said, <div class="bookquote">``if you had so much as seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As seen Mrs. Newsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Sarah--which, both for Chad and for myself, has served all the
purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And served it in a manner,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) responsively mused, <div class="bookquote">``so extraordinary!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) partly explained, <div class="bookquote">``what it comes to is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s
all cold thought--which Sarah could serve to us cold without its really
losing anything. So it is that we know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) thinks of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria had followed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had an arrest. <div class="bookquote">``What I've never made out,
if you come to that, is what you think--I mean you personally--of HER.
Don't you so much, when all's said, as care a little?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) answered with no loss of promptness, <div class="bookquote">``is what even Chad
himself asked me last night. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) asked me if I don't mind the
loss--well, the loss of an opulent future. Which moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
hastened to add, <div class="bookquote">``was a perfectly natural question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call your attention, all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>said Miss Gostrey, <div class="bookquote">``to the fact
that I don't ask it. What I venture to ask is whether it's to Mrs.
Newsome herself that you're indifferent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't been so'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke with all assurance. <div class="bookquote">``I've been the very
opposite. I've been, from the first moment, preoccupied with the
impression everything might be making on her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)--quite oppressed, haunted,
tormented by it. I've been interested ONLY in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) seeing what I've
seen. And I've been as disappointed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) refusal to see it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
has been in what has appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) the perversity of my insistence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) has shocked you as you've shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether weighed it. <div class="bookquote">``I'm probably not so shockable. But on the other
hand I've gone much further to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), on her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) side, hasn't
budged an inch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that you're now at last'' (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>--Maria pointed the moral--<div class="bookquote">``in the sad
stage of recriminations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--it's only to you I speak. I've been like a lamb to Sarah. I've
only put my back to the wall. It's to THAT one naturally staggers when
one has been violently pushed there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Thrown over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as I feel I've landed somewhere I think I must have been thrown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) turned it over, but as hoping to clarify much rather than to
harmonise. <div class="bookquote">``The thing is that I suppose you've been disappointing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite from the very first of my arrival? I dare say. I admit I was
surprising even to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria went on, <div class="bookquote">``I had much to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With my being surprising--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``if you're too delicate to call it MY
being! Naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``you came over more or less for
surprises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) valued the reminder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But they were to have been all for you'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) continued to piece it
out--<div class="bookquote">``and none of them for HER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stopped before her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had touched the point.
<div class="bookquote">``That's just her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) difficulty--that she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) doesn't admit surprises. It's a
fact that, I think, describes and represents her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>); and it falls in with
what I tell you--that she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)'s all, as I've called it, fine cold thought.
She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) had, to her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) own mind, worked the whole thing out in advance, and
worked it out for me as well as for herself. Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) has done
that, you see, there's no room left; no margin, as it were, for any
alteration. She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)'s filled as full, packed as tight, as she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)'ll hold and
if you wish to get anything more or different either out or in--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to make over altogether the woman herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What it comes to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``is that you've got morally and
intellectually to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which would appear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria returned, <div class="bookquote">``to be practically what you've
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) friend threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't touched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't
BE touched. I see it now as I've never done; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hangs together
with a perfection of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that does suggest a kind of
wrong in ANY change of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) composition. It was at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wound
up, <div class="bookquote">``the woman herself, as you call her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the whole moral and
intellectual being or block, that Sarah brought me over to take or to
leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It turned Miss Gostrey to deeper thought. <div class="bookquote">``Fancy having to take at the
point of the bayonet a whole moral and intellectual being or block!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was in fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``what, at home, I HAD done. But
somehow over there I didn't quite know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One never does, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey concurred, <div class="bookquote">``realise in
advance, in such a case, the size, as you may say, of the block. Little
by little it looms up. It has been looming for you more and more till
at last you see it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) absently echoed, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes might have been
fixing some particularly large iceberg in a cool blue northern sea.
<div class="bookquote">``It's magnificent!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) then rather oddly exclaimed.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend, who was used to this kind of inconsequence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), kept
the thread. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing so magnificent--for making others feel
you--as to have no imagination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) straight round. <div class="bookquote">``Ah there you are! It's what I said
last night to Chad. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) himself, I mean, has none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it would appear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria suggested, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has, after all,
something in common with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) has in common that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) makes one, as you say, `feel' him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). And yet,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added, as if the question were interesting, <div class="bookquote">``one feels others too,
even when they have plenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gostrey continued suggestive. <div class="bookquote">``Madame de Vionnet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``SHE has plenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had quantities of old. But there are different ways of
making one's self felt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it comes, no doubt, to that. You now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was benevolently going on, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) wouldn't have it. ``Oh I DON``T
make myself felt; so my quantity needn't be settled. Yours, you know,''
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is monstrous. No one has ever had so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``That's what Chad also thinks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There YOU are then--though it isn't for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to complain of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) doesn't complain of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all that would be wanting! But apropos of what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria went on,
<div class="bookquote">``did the question come up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) asking me what it is I gain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had a pause. <div class="bookquote">``Then as I've asked you too it settles my case. Oh
you HAVE,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``treasures of imagination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been for an instant thinking away from this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came up
in another place. <div class="bookquote">``And yet Mrs. Newsome--it's a thing to remember--HAS
imagined, did, that is, imagine, and apparently still does, horrors
about what I should have found. I was booked, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
vision--extraordinarily intense, after all--to find them; and that I
didn't, that I couldn't, that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) evidently felt, I wouldn't--this
evidently didn't at all, as they say, `suit' her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) book. It was more than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) could bear. That was her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) disappointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean you were to have found Chad himself horrible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was to have found the woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Horrible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>And Strether paused as if for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own
expression of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could add no touch to that picture.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) companion had meanwhile thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) imagined stupidly--so it
comes to the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stupidly? Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) insisted. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) imagined meanly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had it, however, better. <div class="bookquote">``It couldn't but be ignorantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, intensity with ignorance--what do you want worse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>This question might have held him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) let it pass. <div class="bookquote">``Sarah isn't
ignorant--now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) keeps up the theory of the horrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s intense--and that by itself will do sometimes as well. If
it doesn't do, in this case, at any rate, to deny that Marie's
charming, it will do at least to deny that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I claim is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s good for Chad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't claim'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) seemed to like it clear--<div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s good for
YOU.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) continued without heeding. <div class="bookquote">``That's what I wanted them to come
out for--to see for themselves if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s bad for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now that they've done so they won't admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s good even for
anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether presently admitted, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s on the whole
about as bad for me. But they're consistent of course, inasmuch as
they've their clear view of what's good for both of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For you, to begin with'' (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>--Maria, all responsive, confined the question
for the moment--<div class="bookquote">``to eliminate from your existence and if possible even
from your memory the dreadful creature that I must gruesomely shadow
forth for them, even more than to eliminate the distincter
evil--thereby a little less portentous--of the person whose confederate
you've suffered yourself to become. However, that's comparatively
simple. You can easily, at the worst, after all, give me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can easily at the worst, after all, give you up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The irony was so
obvious that it needed no care. <div class="bookquote">``I can easily at the worst, after all,
even forget you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call that then workable. But Mr. Newsome has much more to forget. How
can HE (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah there again we are! That's just what I was to have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) do;
just where I was to have worked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) and helped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) took it in silence and without attenuation--as if perhaps from very
familiarity with the facts; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thought made a connexion without
showing the links. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember how we used to talk at Chester and
in London about my seeing you through?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) spoke as of far-off
things and as if they had spent weeks at the places she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) named.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just what you ARE doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but the worst--since you've left such a margin--may be still to
come. You may yet break down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I may yet break down. But will you take me--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had hesitated, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) waited. <div class="bookquote">``Take you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For as long as I can bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) also debated <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Newsome and Madame de Vionnet may, as we were
saying, leave town. How long do you think you can bear it without
them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's reply to this was at first another question. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean
in order to get away from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) answer had an abruptness. <div class="bookquote">``Don't find me rude if I say I should
think they'd want to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hard again--seemed even for an instant to have an
intensity of thought under which his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) colour changed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``You mean after what they've done to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After what SHE has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At this, however, with a laugh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was all right again. <div class="bookquote">``Ah but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
hasn't done it yet!''



 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>III


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had taken the train a few days after this from a station--as well as
to a station--selected almost at random; such days, whatever should
happen, were numbered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had gone forth under the impulse--artless
enough, no doubt--to give the whole of one of them to that French
ruralism, with its cool special green, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had hitherto
looked only through the little oblong window of the picture-frame. It
had been as yet for the most part but a land of fancy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--the
background of fiction, the medium of art, the nursery of letters;
practically as distant as Greece, but practically also well-nigh as
consecrated. Romance could weave itself, for Strether's sense, out of
elements mild enough; and even after what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt, lately
<div class="bookquote">``been through,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could thrill a little at the chance of seeing
something somewhere that would remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) of a certain small Lambinet
that had charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), long years before, at a Boston dealer's and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) had quite absurdly never forgotten. It had been offered, he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>)
remembered, at a price he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) had been instructed to believe the lowest
ever named for a Lambinet, a price he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) had never felt so poor as on
having to recognise, all the same, as beyond a dream of possibility. He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>)
had dreamed--had turned and twisted possibilities for an hour: it had
been the only adventure of his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) life in connexion with the purchase of a
work of art. The adventure, it will be perceived, was modest; but the
memory, beyond all reason and by some accident of association, was
sweet. The little Lambinet abode with him (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) as the picture he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) WOULD have
bought--the particular production that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) for the moment
overstep the modesty of nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) was quite aware that if he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) were to
see it again he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) should perhaps have a drop or a shock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) never
found himself wishing that the wheel of time would turn it up again,
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) had seen it in the maroon-coloured, sky-lighted inner shrine
of Tremont Street. It would be a different thing, however, to see the
remembered mixture resolved back into its elements--to assist at the
restoration to nature of the whole far-away hour: the dusty day in
Boston, the background of the Fitchburg Depot, of the maroon-coloured
sanctum, the special-green vision, the ridiculous price, the poplars,
the willows, the rushes, the river, the sunny silvery sky, the shady
woody horizon.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) observed in respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) train almost no condition save that it
should stop a few times after getting out of the banlieue; he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) threw
himself on the general amiability of the day for the hint of where to
alight. His (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) theory of his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) excursion was that he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) could alight
anywhere--not nearer Paris than an hour's run--on catching a suggestion
of the particular note required. It made its sign, the
suggestion--weather, air, light, colour and his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) mood all favouring--at
the end of some eighty minutes; the train pulled up just at the right
spot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) found himself getting out as securely as if to keep an
appointment. It will be felt of him (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) could amuse himself, at
his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) age, with very small things if it be again noted that his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>)
appointment was only with a superseded Boston fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) hadn't gone
far without the quick confidence that it would be quite sufficiently
kept. The oblong gilt frame disposed its enclosing lines; the poplars
and willows, the reeds and river--a river of which he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) didn't know, and
didn't want to know, the name--fell into a composition, full of
felicity, within them; the sky was silver and turquoise and varnish;
the village on the left was white and the church on the right was grey;
it was all there, in short--it was what he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) wanted: it was Tremont
Street, it was France, it was Lambinet. Moreover he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) was freely walking
about in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) did this last, for an hour, to his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) heart's content,
making for the shady woody horizon and boring so deep into his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>)
impression and his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) idleness that he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) might fairly have got through them
again and reached the maroon-coloured wall. It was a wonder, no doubt,
that the taste of idleness for him (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) shouldn't need more time to sweeten;
but it had in fact taken the few previous days; it had been sweetening
in truth ever since the retreat of the Pococks. He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) walked and walked as
if to show himself how little he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) had now to do; he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) had nothing to do
but turn off to some hillside where he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) might stretch himself and hear
the poplars rustle, and whence--in the course of an afternoon so spent,
an afternoon richly suffused too with the sense of a book in his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>)
pocket--he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) should sufficiently command the scene to be able to pick out
just the right little rustic inn for an experiment in respect to
dinner. There was a train back to Paris at 9.20, and he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) saw himself
partaking, at the close of the day, with the enhancements of a coarse
white cloth and a sanded door, of something fried and felicitous,
washed down with authentic wine; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) might, as he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) liked,
either stroll back to his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) station in the gloaming or propose for the
local carriole and converse with his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) driver, a driver who naturally
wouldn't fail of a stiff clean blouse, of a knitted nightcap and of the
genius of response--who, in fine, would sit on the shafts, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>)
what the French people were thinking, and remind him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>), as indeed the
whole episode would incidentally do, of Maupassant. Strether heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
lips, for the first time in French air, as this vision assumed
consistency, emit sounds of expressive intention without fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
company. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been afraid of Chad and of Maria and of Madame de
Vionnet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had been most of all afraid of Waymarsh, in whose presence,
so far as they had mixed together in the light of the town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had
never without somehow paying for it aired either his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) vocabulary or his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
accent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) usually paid for it by meeting immediately afterwards
Waymarsh's eye.

<p/>Such were the liberties with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) fancy played after he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had turned
off to the hillside that did really and truly, as well as most amiably,
await him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) beneath the poplars, the hillside that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) feel, for a
murmurous couple of hours, how happy had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had the
sense of success, of a finer harmony in things; nothing but what had
turned out as yet according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) plan. It most of all came home to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) back on the grass, that Sarah had really gone,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) tension was really relaxed; the peace diffused in these ideas
might be delusive, but it hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) none the less for the time. It
fairly, for half an hour, sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) to sleep; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) straw hat
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) eyes--he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had bought it the day before with a reminiscence of
Waymarsh's--and lost himself anew in Lambinet. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had
found out he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was tired--tired not from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) walk, but from that inward
exercise which had known, on the whole, for three months, so little
intermission. That was it--when once they were off he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had dropped;
this moreover was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had dropped to, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was touching
bottom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was kept luxuriously quiet, soothed and amused by the
consciousness of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had found at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) descent. It was
very much what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had told Maria Gostrey he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) should like to stay on for,
the hugely-distributed Paris of summer, alternately dazzling and dusky,
with a weight lifted for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) off its columns and cornices and with
shade and air in the flutter of awnings as wide as avenues. It was
present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) without attenuation that, reaching out, the day after
making the remark, for some proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) freedom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had gone that very
afternoon to see Madame de Vionnet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had gone again the next day but
one, and the effect of the two visits, the after-sense of the couple of
hours spent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>), was almost that of fulness and frequency. The
brave intention of frequency, so great with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) from the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
finding himself unjustly suspected at Woollett, had remained rather
theoretic, and one of the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could muse about under his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) poplars
was the source of the special shyness that had still made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) careful.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had surely got rid of it now, this special shyness; what had become
of it if it hadn't precisely, within the week, rubbed off?

<p/>It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) now in fact as sufficiently plain that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had still
been careful he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had been so for a reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had really feared, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
behaviour, a lapse from good faith; if there was a danger of one's
liking such a woman too much one's best safety was in waiting at least
till one had the right to do so. In the light of the last few days the
danger was fairly vivid; so that it was proportionately fortunate that
the right was likewise established. It seemed to our friend that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
on each occasion profited to the utmost by the latter: how could he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
have done so more, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at all events asked himself, than in having
immediately let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) know that, if it was all the same to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
preferred not to talk about anything tiresome? He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
life so sacrificed an armful of high interests as in that remark; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had never so prepared the way for the comparatively frivolous as in
addressing it to Madame de Vionnet's intelligence. It hadn't been till
later that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) quite recalled how in conjuring away everything but the
pleasant he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had conjured away almost all they had hitherto talked
about; it was not till later even that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) remembered how, with their
new tone, they hadn't so much as mentioned the name of Chad himself.
One of the things that most lingered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hillside was this
delightful facility, with such a woman, of arriving at a new tone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) back, of all the tones she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might make
possible if one were to try her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and at any rate of the probability
that one could trust her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to fit them to occasions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
to feel that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was disinterested now, so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself should be,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had showed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was grateful, and
it had been for all the world as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) were calling for the first time.
They had had other, but irrelevant, meetings; it was quite as if, had
they sooner known how much they REALLY had in common, there were
quantities of comparatively dull matters they might have skipped. Well,
they were skipping them now, even to graceful gratitude, even to
handsome <div class="bookquote">``Don't mention it!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and it was amazing what could still come
up without reference to what had been going on between them. It might
have been, on analysis, nothing more than Shakespeare and the musical
glasses; but it had served all the purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) appearing to have
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Don't like me, if it's a question of liking me, for
anything obvious and clumsy that I've, as they call it, `done' for you:
like me--well, like me, hang it, for anything else you choose. So, by
the same propriety, don't be for me simply the person I've come to know
through my awkward connexion with Chad--was ever anything, by the way,
MORE awkward? Be for me, please, with all your admirable tact and
trust, just whatever I may show you it's a present pleasure to me to
think you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Shakespeare glasses</b></font>)</div>It had been a large indication to meet; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hadn't
met it what HAD she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) done, and how had their time together slipped along
so smoothly, mild but not slow, and melting, liquefying, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) happy
illusion of idleness? He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) could recognise on the other hand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had
probably not been without reason, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) prior, his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) restricted state,
for keeping an eye on his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) liability to lapse from good faith.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) really continued in the picture--that being for himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)
situation--all the rest of this rambling day; so that the charm was
still, was indeed more than ever upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) when, toward six o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)
found himself amicably engaged with a stout white-capped deep-voiced
woman at the door of the auberge of the biggest village, a village that
affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) as a thing of whiteness, blueness and crookedness, set in
coppery green, and that had the river flowing behind or before it--one
couldn't say which; at the bottom, in particular, of the inn-garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)
had had other adventures before this; had kept along the height, after
shaking off slumber; had admired, had almost coveted, another small old
church, all steep roof and dim slate-colour without and all whitewash
and paper flowers within; had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) way and had found it again; had
conversed with rustics who struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) perhaps a little more as men of
the world than he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had expected; had acquired at a bound a fearless
facility in French; had had, as the afternoon waned, a watery bock, all
pale and Parisian, in the cafe of the furthest village, which was not
the biggest; and had meanwhile not once overstepped the oblong gilt
frame. The frame had drawn itself out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>), as much as you please;
but that was just his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) luck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had finally come down again to the
valley, to keep within touch of stations and trains, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) face
to the quarter from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had started; and thus it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had
at last pulled up before the hostess of the Cheval Blanc, who met him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>),
with a rough readiness that was like the clatter of sabots over stones,
on their common ground of a cotelette de veau a l'oseille and a
subsequent lift. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) had walked many miles and didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) was
tired; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) still knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) was amused, and even that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) had
been alone all day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) had never yet so struck himself as engaged with
others and in midstream of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) drama. It might have passed for
finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) drama, with its catastrophe all but reached: it had,
however, none the less been vivid again for him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) thus gave it its
fuller chance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) had only had to be at last well out of it to feel
it, oddly enough, still going on.

<p/>For this had been all day at bottom the spell of the picture--that it
was essentially more than anything else a scene and a stage, that the
very air of the play was in the rustle of the willows and the tone of
the sky. The play and the characters had, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) knowing it till
now, peopled all his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) space for him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>), and it seemed somehow quite happy
that they should offer themselves, in the conditions so supplied, with
a kind of inevitability. It was as if the conditions made them not
only inevitable, but so much more nearly natural and right as that they
were at least easier, pleasanter, to put up with. The conditions had
nowhere so asserted their difference from those of Woollett as they
appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) to assert it in the little court of the Cheval Blanc
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) arranged with his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) hostess for a comfortable climax. They were
few and simple, scant and humble, but they were THE THING, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) would
have called it, even to a greater degree than Madame de Vionnet's old
high salon where the ghost of the Empire walked. <div class="bookquote">``The''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thing was the
thing that implied the greatest number of other things of the sort he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
had had to tackle; and it was queer of course, but so it was--the
implication here was complete. Not a single one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) observations
but somehow fell into a place in it; not a breath of the cooler evening
that wasn't somehow a syllable of the text. The text was simply, when
condensed, that in THESE places such things were, and that if it was in
them one elected to move about one had to make one's account with what
one lighted on. Meanwhile at all events it was enough that they did
affect one--so far as the village aspect was concerned--as whiteness,
crookedness and blueness set in coppery green; there being positively,
for that matter, an outer wall of the White Horse that was painted the
most improbable shade. That was part of the amusement--as if to show
that the fun was harmless; just as it was enough, further, that the
picture and the play seemed supremely to melt together in the good
woman's broad sketch of what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could do for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visitor's appetite.
He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt in short a confidence, and it was general, and it was all he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
wanted to feel. It suffered no shock even on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mentioning that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had in fact just laid the cloth for two persons who, unlike Monsieur,
had arrived by the river--in a boat of their own; who had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
half an hour before, what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could do for them, and had then paddled
away to look at something a little further up--from which promenade
they would presently return. Monsieur might meanwhile, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) liked,
pass into the garden, such as it was, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>), should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) wish it--for there were tables and benches in plenty--a <div class="bookquote">``bitter''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>before his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) repast. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would also report to him (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) on the possibility
of a conveyance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) station, and here at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) would have the
agrement of the river.

<p/>It may be mentioned without delay that Monsieur had the agrement of
everything, and in particular, for the next twenty minutes, of a small
and primitive pavilion that, at the garden's edge, almost overhung the
water, testifying, in its somewhat battered state, to much fond
frequentation. It consisted of little more than a platform, slightly
raised, with a couple of benches and a table, a protecting rail and a
projecting roof; but it raked the full grey-blue stream, which, taking
a turn a short distance above, passed out of sight to reappear much
higher up; and it was clearly in esteemed requisition for Sundays and
other feasts. Strether sat there and, though hungry, felt at peace;
the confidence that had so gathered for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) deepened with the lap of
the water, the ripple of the surface, the rustle of the reeds on the
opposite bank, the faint diffused coolness and the slight rock of a
couple of small boats attached to a rough landing-place hard by. The
valley on the further side was all copper-green level and glazed pearly
sky, a sky hatched across with screens of trimmed trees, which looked
flat, like espaliers; and though the rest of the village straggled away
in the near quarter the view had an emptiness that made one of the
boats suggestive. Such a river set one afloat almost before one could
take up the oars--the idle play of which would be moreover the aid to
the full impression. This perception went so far as to bring him to
his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) feet; but that movement, in turn, made him (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) feel afresh that he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) was
tired, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) leaned against a post and continued to look out he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>)
saw something that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) a sharper arrest.



<p/>IV

<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) saw was exactly the right thing--a boat advancing round the
bend and containing a man who held the paddles and a lady, at the
stern, with a pink parasol. It was suddenly as if these figures, or
something like them, had been wanted in the picture, had been wanted
more or less all day, and had now drifted into sight, with the slow
current, on purpose to fill up the measure. They came slowly, floating
down, evidently directed to the landing-place near their spectator and
presenting themselves to him (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) not less clearly as the two persons for
whom his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) hostess was already preparing a meal. For two very happy
persons he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) found himself straightway taking them--a young man in
shirt-sleeves, a young woman easy and fair, who had pulled pleasantly
up from some other place and, being acquainted with the neighbourhood,
had known what this particular retreat could offer them. The air quite
thickened, at their approach, with further intimations; the intimation
that they were expert, familiar, frequent--that this wouldn't at all
events be the first time. They knew how to do it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vaguely felt--and
it made them but the more idyllic, though at the very moment of the
impression, as happened, their boat seemed to have begun to drift wide,
the oarsman letting it go. It had by this time none the less come
much nearer--near enough for Strether to dream the lady in the stern
had for some reason taken account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) being there to watch them. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had remarked on it sharply, yet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion hadn't turned round; it
was in fact almost as if our friend had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bid him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) keep still.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had taken in something as a result of which their course had
wavered, and it continued to waver while they just stood off. This
little effect was sudden and rapid, so rapid that Strether's sense of
it was separate only for an instant from a sharp start of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
too had within the minute taken in something, taken in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew the
lady whose parasol, shifting as if to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face, made so fine a
pink point in the shining scene. It was too prodigious, a chance in a
million, but, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew the lady, the gentleman, who still presented
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) back and kept off, the gentleman, the coatless hero of the idyll,
who had responded to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) start, was, to match the marvel, none other
than Chad.

<p/>Chad and Madame de Vionnet were then like himself taking a day in the
country--though it was as queer as fiction, as farce, that their
country could happen to be exactly his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been the first at
recognition, the first to feel, across the water, the shock--for it
appeared to come to that--of their wonderful accident. Strether became
aware, with this, of what was taking place--that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) recognition had
been even stranger for the pair in the boat, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) immediate impulse
had been to control it, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was quickly and intensely debating
with Chad the risk of betrayal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) saw they would show nothing if they
could feel sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't made them out; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had before him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) for
a few seconds his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own hesitation. It was a sharp fantastic crisis that
had popped up as if in a dream, and it had had only to last the few
seconds to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) feel it as quite horrible. They were thus, on
either side, TRYING the other side, and all for some reason that broke
the stillness like some unprovoked harsh note. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) again,
within the limit, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had but one thing to do--to settle their
common question by some sign of surprise and joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hereupon gave
large play to these things, agitating his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) stick and loudly
calling out--a demonstration that brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) relief as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
seen it answered. The boat, in mid-stream, still went a little
wild--which seemed natural, however, while Chad turned round, half
springing up; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) good friend, after blankness and wonder, began
gaily to wave her (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) parasol. Chad dropped afresh to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) paddles and the
boat headed round, amazement and pleasantry filling the air meanwhile,
and relief, as Strether continued to fancy, superseding mere violence.
Our friend went down to the water under this odd impression as of
violence averted--the violence of their having <div class="bookquote">``cut''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), out there in
the eye of nature, on the assumption that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wouldn't know it. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
awaited them with a face from which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was conscious of not being able
quite to banish this idea that they would have gone on, not seeing and
not knowing, missing their dinner and disappointing their hostess, had
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) himself taken a line to match. That at least was what darkened his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
vision for the moment. Afterwards, after they had bumped at the
landing-place and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had assisted their getting ashore, everything
found itself sponged over by the mere miracle of the encounter.

<p/>They could so much better at last, on either side, treat it as a wild
extravagance of hazard, that the situation was made elastic by the
amount of explanation called into play. Why indeed--apart from
oddity--the situation should have been really stiff was a question
naturally not practical at the moment, and in fact, so far as we are
concerned, a question tackled, later on and in private, only by
Strether himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to reflect later on and in private that it
was mainly HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) who had explained--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had had moreover comparatively
little difficulty in doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was to have at all events meanwhile the
worrying thought of their perhaps secretly suspecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) of having
plotted this coincidence, taking such pains as might be to give it the
semblance of an accident. That possibility--as their
imputation--didn't of course bear looking into for an instant; yet the
whole incident was so manifestly, arrange it as they would, an awkward
one, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could scarce keep disclaimers in respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own
presence from rising to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lips. Disclaimers of intention would have
been as tactless as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) presence was practically gross; and the
narrowest escape they either of them had was his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lucky escape, in the
event, from making any. Nothing of the sort, so far as surface and
sound were involved, was even in question; surface and sound all made
for their common ridiculous good fortune, for the general
invraisemblance of the occasion, for the charming chance that they had,
the others, in passing, ordered some food to be ready, the charming
chance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had himself not eaten, the charming chance, even more,
that their little plans, their hours, their train, in short, from
la-bas, would all match for their return together to Paris. The chance
that was most charming of all, the chance that drew from Madame de
Vionnet her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) clearest, gayest <div class="bookquote">``Comme cela se trouve!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>was the
announcement made to Strether after they were seated at table, the word
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) by their hostess in respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) carriage for the station,
on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might now count. It settled the matter for his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friends as
well; the conveyance--it WAS all too lucky!--would serve for them; and
nothing was more delightful than his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) being in a position to make the
train so definite. It might have been, for themselves--to hear Madame
de Vionnet--almost unnaturally vague, a detail left to be fixed; though
Strether indeed was afterwards to remember that Chad had promptly
enough intervened to forestall this appearance, laughing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
companion's flightiness and making the point that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had after all, in
spite of the bedazzlement of a day out with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), known what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was
about.

<p/>Strether was to remember afterwards further that this had had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
the effect of forming Chad's almost sole intervention; and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
was to remember further still, in subsequent meditation, many things
that, as it were, fitted together. Another of them was for instance
that the wonderful woman's overflow of surprise and amusement was
wholly into French, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as speaking with an
unprecedented command of idiomatic turns, but in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
might have said, somewhat away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), taking all at once little
brilliant jumps that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could but lamely match. The question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
own French had never come up for them; it was the one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
wouldn't have permitted--it belonged, for a person who had been through
much, to mere boredom; but the present result was odd, fairly veiling
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) identity, shifting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back into a mere voluble class or race to
the intense audibility of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was by this time inured. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
spoke the charming slightly strange English he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) best knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
seemed to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as a creature, among all the millions, with a
language quite to herself, the real monopoly of a special shade of
speech, beautifully easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), yet of a colour and a cadence that
were both inimitable and matters of accident. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came back to these
things after they had shaken down in the inn-parlour and knew, as it
were, what was to become of them; it was inevitable that loud
ejaculation over the prodigy of their convergence should at last wear
itself out. Then it was that his (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) impression took fuller form--the
impression, destined only to deepen, to complete itself, that they had
something to put a face upon, to carry off and make the best of, and
that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who, admirably on the whole, was doing this. It was
familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) of course that they had something to put a face upon;
their friendship, their connexion, took any amount of explaining--that
would have been made familiar by his (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) twenty minutes with Mrs. Pocock if
it hadn't already been so. Yet his (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) theory, as we know, had bountifully
been that the facts were specifically none of his (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) business, and were,
over and above, so far as one had to do with them, intrinsically
beautiful; and this might have prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) for anything, as well as
rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) proof against mystification. When he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) reached home that
night, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) had been, at bottom, neither prepared nor
proof; and since we have spoken of what he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) was, after his (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) return, to
recall and interpret, it may as well immediately be said that his (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) real
experience of these few hours put on, in that belated vision--for he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>)
scarce went to bed till morning--the aspect that is most to our purpose.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) then knew more or less how he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) had been affected--he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) but half knew at
the time. There had been plenty to affect him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) even after, as has been
said, they had shaken down; for his (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) consciousness, though muffled, had
its sharpest moments during this passage, a marked drop into innocent
friendly Bohemia. They then had put their elbows on the table,
deploring the premature end of their two or three dishes; which they
had tried to make up with another bottle while Chad joked a little
spasmodically, perhaps even a little irrelevantly, with the hostess.
What it all came to had been that fiction and fable WERE, inevitably,
in the air, and not as a simple term of comparison, but as a result of
things said; also that they were blinking it, all round, and that they
yet needn't, so much as that, have blinked it--though indeed if they
hadn't Strether didn't quite see what else they could have done.
Strether didn't quite see THAT even at an hour or two past midnight,
even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hotel, for a long time, without a light and
without undressing, sat back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) bedroom sofa and stared straight
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was, at that point of vantage, in full possession, to
make of it all what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) kept making of it that there had been
simply a LIE in the charming affair--a lie on which one could now,
detached and deliberate, perfectly put one's finger. It was with the
lie that they had eaten and drunk and talked and laughed, that they had
waited for their carriole rather impatiently, and had then got into the
vehicle and, sensibly subsiding, driven their three or four miles
through the darkening summer night. The eating and drinking, which had
been a resource, had had the effect of having served its turn; the talk
and laughter had done as much; and it was during their somewhat tedious
progress to the station, during the waits there, the further delays,
their submission to fatigue, their silences in the dim compartment of
the much-stopping train, that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) prepared himself for reflexions to
come. It had been a performance, Madame de Vionnet's manner, and though
it had to that degree faltered toward the end, as through her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) ceasing
to believe in it, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had asked herself, or Chad had found a
moment surreptitiously to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), what after all was the use, a
performance it had none the less quite handsomely remained, with the
final fact about it that it was on the whole easier to keep up than to
abandon.

<p/>From the point of view of presence of mind it had been very wonderful
indeed, wonderful for readiness, for beautiful assurance, for the way
her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) decision was taken on the spot, without time to confer with Chad,
without time for anything. Their only conference could have been the
brief instants in the boat before they confessed to recognising the
spectator on the bank, for they hadn't been alone together a moment
since and must have communicated all in silence. It was a part of the
deep impression for Strether, and not the least of the deep interest,
that they COULD so communicate--that Chad in particular could let her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
know he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) left it to her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) habitually left things to others, as
Strether was so well aware, and it in fact came over our friend in
these meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration
of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) famous knowing how to live. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had humoured her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) to
the extent of letting her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) lie without correction--almost as if, really,
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would be coming round in the morning to set the matter, as between
Strether and himself, right. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) couldn't quite come; it was
a case in which a man was obliged to accept the woman's version, even
when fantastic; if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had, with more flurry than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cared to show,
elected, as the phrase was, to represent that they had left Paris that
morning, and with no design but of getting back within the day--if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had so sized-up, in the Woollett phrase, their necessity, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew best
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own measure. There were things, all the same, it was impossible to
blink and which made this measure an odd one--the too evident fact for
instance that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hadn't started out for the day dressed and hatted and
shod, and even, for that matter, pink parasol'd, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been in the
boat. From what did the drop in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) assurance proceed as the tension
increased--from what did this slightly baffled ingenuity spring but
from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) consciousness of not presenting, as night closed in, with not
so much as a shawl to wrap her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) round, an appearance that matched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
story? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) admitted that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was cold, but only to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
imprudence which Chad suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to give such account of as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
might. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shawl and Chad's overcoat and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other garments, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>),
those they had each worn the day before, were at the place, best known
to themselves--a quiet retreat enough, no doubt--at which they had been
spending the twenty-four hours, to which they had fully meant to return
that evening, from which they had so remarkably swum into Strether's
ken, and the tacit repudiation of which had been thus the essence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comedy. Strether saw how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had perceived in a flash that they
couldn't quite look to going back there under his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) nose; though,
honestly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gouged deeper into the matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was somewhat
surprised, as Chad likewise had perhaps been, at the uprising of this
scruple. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) seemed even to divine that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had entertained it rather
for Chad than for herself, and that, as the young man had lacked the
chance to enlighten her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had to go on with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meanwhile
mistaking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) motive.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was rather glad, none the less, that they had in point of fact not
parted at the Cheval Blanc, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) hadn't been reduced to giving them
his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) blessing for an idyllic retreat down the river. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) had had in the
actual case to make-believe more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) liked, but this was nothing,
it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>), to what the other event would have required. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>),
literally, quite have faced the other event? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) have been
capable of making the best of it with them? This was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) was
trying to do now; but with the advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) being able to give more
time to it a good deal counteracted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) sense of what, over and
above the central fact itself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) had to swallow. It was the quantity
of make-believe involved and so vividly exemplified that most disagreed
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) spiritual stomach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) moved, however, from the consideration
of that quantity--to say nothing of the consciousness of that
organ--back to the other feature of the show, the deep, deep truth of
the intimacy revealed. That was what, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) vain vigil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) oftenest
reverted to: intimacy, at such a point, was LIKE that--and what in the
world else would one have wished it to be like? It was all very well
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) to feel the pity of its being so much like lying; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) almost
blushed, in the dark, for the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) had dressed the possibility in
vagueness, as a little girl might have dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doll. He (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) had made
them--and by no fault of their own--momentarily pull it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>), the
possibility, out of this vagueness; and must he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) not therefore take it
now as they had had simply, with whatever thin attenuations, to give it
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>)? The very question, it may be added, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) feel lonely and
cold. There was the element of the awkward all round, but Chad and
Madame de Vionnet had at least the comfort that they could talk it over
together. With whom could HE (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) talk of such things?--unless indeed
always, at almost any stage, with Maria? He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) foresaw that Miss Gostrey
would come again into requisition on the morrow; though it wasn't to be
denied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was already a little afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``What on
earth--that's what I want to know now--had you then supposed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
recognised at last that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had really been trying all along to suppose
nothing. Verily, verily, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) labour had been lost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) found himself
supposing innumerable and wonderful things.





<p/>Book Twelfth




<p/>I


<p/>Strether couldn't have said he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had during the previous hours definitely
expected it; yet when, later on, that morning--though no later indeed
than for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) coming forth at ten o'clock--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) saw the concierge produce,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) approach, a petit bleu delivered since his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) letters had been sent
up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) recognised the appearance as the first symptom of a sequel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
then knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been thinking of some early sign from Chad as more
likely, after all, than not; and this would be precisely the early
sign. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) took it so for granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) opened the petit bleu just
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had stopped, in the pleasant cool draught of the
porte-cochere--only curious to see where the young man would, at such a
juncture, break out. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) curiosity, however, was more than gratified;
the small missive, whose gummed edge he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had detached without attention
to the address, not being from the young man at all, but from the
person whom the case gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the spot as still more worth while.
Worth while or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went round to the nearest telegraph-office, the
big one on the Boulevard, with a directness that almost confessed to a
fear of the danger of delay. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have been thinking that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
didn't go before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't perhaps go at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at
any rate kept, in the lower side-pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) morning coat, a very
deliberate hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue missive, crumpling it up rather tenderly
than harshly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote a reply, on the Boulevard, also in the form of
a petit bleu--which was quickly done, under pressure of the place,
inasmuch as, like Madame de Vionnet's own communication, it consisted
of the fewest words. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could do her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the very
great kindness of coming to see her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that evening at half-past nine, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) answered, as if nothing were easier, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) would present himself
at the hour she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) named. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had added a line of postscript, to the
effect that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) elsewhere and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) own hour if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
preferred; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) took no notice of this, feeling that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at
all half the value of it would be in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had already
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) mightn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at all; that was one of the
reflexions he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) made after writing and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) closed card
into the box; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) mightn't see any one at all any more at all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) might
make an end as well now as ever, leaving things as they were, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
was doubtless not to leave them better, and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) way home so far
as should appear that a home remained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>). This alternative was for
a few minutes so sharp that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) at last did deposit his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) missive it
was perhaps because the pressure of the place had an effect.

<p/>There was none other, however, than the common and constant pressure,
familiar to our friend under the rubric of Postes et Telegraphes--the
something in the air of these establishments; the vibration of the vast
strange life of the town, the influence of the types, the performers
concocting their messages; the little prompt Paris women, arranging,
pretexting goodness knew what, driving the dreadful needle-pointed
public pen at the dreadful sand-strewn public table: implements that
symbolised for Strether's too interpretative innocence something more
acute in manners, more sinister in morals, more fierce in the national
life. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) paper he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had ranged himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was
really amused to think, on the side of the fierce, the sinister, the
acute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was carrying on a correspondence, across the great city,
quite in the key of the Postes et Telegraphes in general; and it was
fairly as if the acceptance of that fact had come from something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
state that sorted with the occupation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) neighbours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was mixed
up with the typical tale of Paris, and so were they, poor things--how
could they all together help being? They were no worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), in
short, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) no worse than they--if, queerly enough, no better; and at
all events he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hash, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went out to begin, from
that moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) day of waiting. The great settlement was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) preference for seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) correspondent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own best
conditions. THAT was part of the typical tale, the part most
significant in respect to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) liked the place she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) lived in,
the picture that each time squared itself, large and high and clear,
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>): every occasion of seeing it was a pleasure of a different
shade. Yet what precisely was he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) doing with shades of pleasure now,
and why hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) properly and logically compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to commit
herself to whatever of disadvantage and penalty the situation might
throw up? He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might have proposed, as for Sarah Pocock, the cold
hospitality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own salon de lecture, in which the chill of Sarah's
visit seemed still to abide and shades of pleasure were dim; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might
have suggested a stone bench in the dusty Tuileries or a penny chair at
the back part of the Champs Elysees. These things would have been a
trifle stern, and sternness alone now wouldn't be sinister. An
instinct in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) cast about for some form of discipline in which they
might meet--some awkwardness they would suffer from, some danger, or at
least some grave inconvenience, they would incur. This would give a
sense--which the spirit required, rather ached and sighed in the
absence of--that somebody was paying something somewhere and somehow,
that they were at least not all floating together on the silver stream
of impunity. Just instead of that to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) late in the
evening, as if, for all the world--well, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) were as much in the
swim as anybody else: this had as little as possible in common with
the penal form.

<p/>Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had felt that objection melt away, however, the practical
difference was small; the long stretch of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) interval took the colour
it would, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) lived on thus with the sinister from hour to hour
it proved an easier thing than one might have supposed in advance. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
reverted in thought to his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) old tradition, the one he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had been brought
up on and which even so many years of life had but little worn away;
the notion that the state of the wrongdoer, or at least this person's
happiness, presented some special difficulty. What struck him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) now
rather was the ease of it--for nothing in truth appeared easier. It
was an ease he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) himself fairly tasted of for the rest of the day; giving
himself quite up; not so much as trying to dress it out, in any
particular whatever, as a difficulty; not after all going to see
Maria--which would have been in a manner a result of such dressing;
only idling, lounging, smoking, sitting in the shade, drinking lemonade
and consuming ices. The day had turned to heat and eventual thunder,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) now and again went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hotel to find that Chad hadn't
been there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't yet struck himself, since leaving Woollett, so
much as a loafer, though there had been times when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) believed himself
touching bottom. This was a deeper depth than any, and with no
foresight, scarcely with a care, as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should bring up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
almost wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) didn't LOOK demoralised and disreputable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
the fanciful vision, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) sat and smoked, of some accidental, some
motived, return of the Pococks, who would be passing along the
Boulevard and would catch this view of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). They would have distinctly,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) appearance, every ground for scandal. But fate failed to
administer even that sternness; the Pococks never passed and Chad made
no sign. Strether meanwhile continued to hold off from Miss Gostrey,
keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) till to-morrow; so that by evening his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) irresponsibility,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) impunity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) luxury, had become--there was no other word for
them--immense.

<p/>Between nine and ten, at last, in the high clear picture--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was moving
in these days, as in a gallery, from clever canvas to clever canvas--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
drew a long breath: it was so presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) from the first that the
spell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) luxury wouldn't be broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wouldn't have, that is, to
become responsible--this was admirably in the air: she (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
precisely to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) feel it, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might go on with the comfort
-LRB-comfort already established, hadn't it been?-RRB- of regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) ordeal,
the ordeal of the weeks of Sarah's stay and of their climax, as safely
traversed and left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) just wish to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) that
SHE now took it all and so kept it; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was absolutely not to worry
any more, was only to rest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) laurels and continue generously to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)? The light in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) beautiful formal room was dim, though it
would do, as everything would always do; the hot night had kept out
lamps, but there was a pair of clusters of candles that glimmered over
the chimney-piece like the tall tapers of an altar. The windows were
all open, their redundant hangings swaying a little, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) heard once
more, from the empty court, the small plash of the fountain. From
beyond this, and as from a great distance--beyond the court, beyond the
corps de logis forming the front--came, as if excited and exciting, the
vague voice of Paris. Strether had all along been subject to sudden
gusts of fancy in connexion with such matters as these--odd starts of
the historic sense, suppositions and divinations with no warrant but
their intensity. Thus and so, on the eve of the great recorded dates,
the days and nights of revolution, the sounds had come in, the omens,
the beginnings broken out. They were the smell of revolution, the
smell of the public temper--or perhaps simply the smell of blood.

<p/>It was at present queer beyond words, <div class="bookquote">``subtle,''  (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have risked
saying, that such suggestions should keep crossing the scene; but it
was doubtless the effect of the thunder in the air, which had hung
about all day without release. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hostess was dressed as for
thunderous times, and it fell in with the kind of imagination we have
just attributed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) should be in simplest coolest white, of
a character so old-fashioned, if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) were not mistaken, that Madame
Roland must on the scaffold have worn something like it. This effect
was enhanced by a small black fichu or scarf, of crape or gauze,
disposed quaintly round her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) bosom and now completing as by a mystic
touch the pathetic, the noble analogy. Poor Strether in fact scarce
knew what analogy was evoked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) as the charming woman, receiving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could do such things, at once familiarly and
gravely welcome, moved over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) great room with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) image almost
repeated in its polished floor, which had been fully bared for summer.
The associations of the place, all felt again; the gleam here and
there, in the subdued light, of glass and gilt and parquet, with the
quietness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own note as the centre--these things were at first as
delicate as if they had been ghostly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) was sure in a moment that,
whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) should find he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) had come for, it wouldn't be for an
impression that had previously failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>). That conviction held him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>)
from the outset, and, seeming singularly to simplify, certified to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>)
that the objects about would help him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>), would really help them both. No,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) might never see them again--this was only too probably the last
time; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) should certainly see nothing in the least degree like
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) should soon be going to where such things were not, and it
would be a small mercy for memory, for fancy, to have, in that stress,
a loaf on the shelf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) knew in advance he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) should look back on the
perception actually sharpest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) as on the view of something old,
old, old, the oldest thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) had ever personally touched; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) also
knew, even while he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) companion in as the feature among
features, that memory and fancy couldn't help being enlisted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) might intend what she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) would, but this was beyond anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) could
intend, with things from far back--tyrannies of history, facts of type,
values, as the painters said, of expression--all working for her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) and
giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) the supreme chance, the chance of the happy, the really
luxurious few, the chance, on a great occasion, to be natural and
simple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) had never, with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>), been more so; or if it was the
perfection of art it would never--and that came to the same thing--be
proved against her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>).

<p/>What was truly wonderful was her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) way of differing so from time to time
without detriment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) simplicity. Caprices, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) felt,
were before anything else bad manners, and that judgement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) was by
itself a thing making more for safety of intercourse than anything that
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) various own past intercourses he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) had had to reckon on. If
therefore her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) presence was now quite other than the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) had shown
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) the night before, there was nothing of violence in the change--it
was all harmony and reason. It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) a mild deep person, whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>)
had had on the occasion to which their interview was a direct reference
a person committed to movement and surface and abounding in them; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) was in either character more remarkable for nothing than for her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>)
bridging of intervals, and this now fell in with what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) understood he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
was to leave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>). The only thing was that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was to leave it
ALL to her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>), why exactly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had had, vaguely, in
advance, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) explanation, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) view of the probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) wishing to
set something right, to deal in some way with the fraud so lately
practised on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) presumed credulity. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) attempt to carry it
further or would she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) blot it out? Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) throw over it some more or
less happy colour; or would she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) do nothing about it at all? He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
perceived soon enough at least that, however reasonable she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) might be,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) wasn't vulgarly confused, and it herewith pressed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that
their eminent <div class="bookquote">``lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Chad's and hers, was simply after all such an
inevitable tribute to good taste as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) couldn't have wished them not to
render. Away from them, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) vigil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had seemed to wince at
the amount of comedy involved; whereas in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) present posture he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could
only ask himself how he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) should enjoy any attempt from her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) to take the
comedy back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) shouldn't enjoy it at all; but, once more and yet once
more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>). That is he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) to make deception
right. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) presented things the ugliness--goodness knew why--went
out of them; none the less too that she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) could present them, with an art
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) own, by not so much as touching them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) let the matter, at
all events, lie where it was--where the previous twenty-four hours had
placed it; appearing merely to circle about it respectfully, tenderly,
almost piously, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) took up another question.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) hadn't really thrown dust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) eyes; this, the previous
night, before they separated, had practically passed between them; and,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) had sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to see what the difference thus made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
might amount to, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was conscious at the end of five minutes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had been tried and tested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) had settled with Chad after he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) left
them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) would, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) satisfaction, assure herself of this
quantity, and Chad had, as usual, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) way. Chad was
always letting people have their way when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) felt that it would somehow
turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wheel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); it somehow always did turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wheel. Strether
felt, oddly enough, before these facts, freshly and consentingly
passive; they again so rubbed it into him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that the couple thus fixing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) attention were intimate, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) intervention had absolutely aided
and intensified their intimacy, and that in fine he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) must accept the
consequence of that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had absolutely become, himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
perceptions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mistakes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) concessions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) reserves, the
droll mixture, as it must seem to them, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) braveries and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fears,
the general spectacle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) art and his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) innocence, almost an added
link and certainly a common priceless ground for them to meet upon. It
was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been hearing their very tone when she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) brought out a
reference that was comparatively straight. <div class="bookquote">``The last twice that you've
been here, you know, I never asked you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said with an abrupt
transition--they had been pretending before this to talk simply of the
charm of yesterday and of the interest of the country they had seen.
The effort was confessedly vain; not for such talk had she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>);
and her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) impatient reminder was of their having done for it all the
needful on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) after Sarah's flight. What she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hadn't
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) then was to state to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) where and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stood for her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
had been resting on Chad's report of their midnight hour together in
the Boulevard Malesherbes. The thing therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) at present desired
was ushered in by this recall of the two occasions on which,
disinterested and merciful, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hadn't worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). To-night truly she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
WOULD worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and this was her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to let her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) risk it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
wasn't to mind if she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) bored him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) a little: she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had behaved, after
all--hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)?--so awfully, awfully well.



<p/>II


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're all right, you're all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) almost impatiently
declared; his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) impatience being moreover not for her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) pressure, but for
her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) scruple. More and more distinct to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was the tune to which she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
would have had the matter out with Chad: more and more vivid for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had been nervous as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might be able to
<div class="bookquote">``stand.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yes, it had been a question if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``stood''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>what the scene
on the river had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and, though the young man had doubtless
opined in favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recuperation, her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) own last word must have been
that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) should feel easier in seeing for herself. That was it,
unmistakeably; she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) WAS seeing for herself. What he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could stand was
thus, in these moments, in the balance for Strether, who reflected, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) became fully aware of it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) must properly brace himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
wanted fully to appear to stand all he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might; and there was a certain
command of the situation for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in this very wish not to look too much
at sea. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was ready with everything, but so, sufficiently, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>);
that is he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was at one point the more prepared of the two, inasmuch as,
for all her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) cleverness, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) couldn't produce on the spot--and it was
surprising--an account of the motive of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) note. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had the advantage
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pronouncing her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``all right''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for an enquiry. <div class="bookquote">``May I
ask, delighted as I've been to come, if you've wished to say something
special?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke as if she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) might have seen he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had been waiting for
it--not indeed with discomfort, but with natural interest. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) saw
that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was a little taken aback, was even surprised herself at the
detail she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had neglected--the only one ever yet; having somehow assumed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would know, would recognise, would leave some things not to be said.
She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), however, an instant as if to convey that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
wanted them ALL--!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Selfish and vulgar--that's what I must seem to you. You've done
everything for me, and here I am as if I were asking for more. But it
isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``because I'm afraid--though I AM of course afraid,
as a woman in my position always is. I mean it isn't because one lives
in terror--it isn't because of that one is selfish, for I'm ready to
give you my word to-night that I don't care; don't care what still may
happen and what I may lose. I don't ask you to raise your little
finger for me again, nor do I wish so much as to mention to you what
we've talked of before, either my danger or my safety, or his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother,
or his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sister, or the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may marry, or the fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may make or
miss, or the right or the wrong, of any kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may do. If after the
help one has had from you one can't either take care of one's self or
simply hold one's tongue, one must renounce all claim to be an object
of interest. It's in the name of what I DO care about that I've tried
still to keep hold of you. How can I be indifferent,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``to
how I appear to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found himself unable immediately to
say: <div class="bookquote">``Why, if you're going, NEED you, after all? Is it impossible you
should stay on--so that one mayn't lose you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible I should live with you here instead of going home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not `with' us, if you object to that, but near enough to us,
somewhere, for us to see you--well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) beautifully brought out, <div class="bookquote">``when
we feel we MUST. How shall we not sometimes feel it? I've wanted to
see you often when I couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``all these last weeks. How
shan't I then miss you now, with the sense of your being gone forever?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then as if the straightness of this appeal, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) unprepared, had
visibly left him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wondering: <div class="bookquote">``Where IS your `home' moreover now--what
has become of it? I've made a change in your life, I know I have; I've
upset everything in your mind as well; in your sense of--what shall I
call it?--all the decencies and possibilities. It gives me a kind of
detestation--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) pulled up short.

<p/>Oh but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wanted to hear. <div class="bookquote">``Detestation of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of everything--of life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah that's too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) laughed--<div class="bookquote">``or too little!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too little, precisely'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was eager. <div class="bookquote">``What I hate is myself--when I
think that one has to take so much, to be happy, out of the lives of
others, and that one isn't happy even then. One does it to cheat one's
self and to stop one's mouth--but that's only at the best for a little.
The wretched self is always there, always making one somehow a fresh
anxiety. What it comes to is that it's not, that it's never, a
happiness, any happiness at all, to TAKE. The only safe thing is to
give. It's what plays you least false.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Interesting, touching,
strikingly sincere as she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) let these things come from her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) yet
puzzled and troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)--so fine was the quaver of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) quietness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
felt what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had felt before with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), that there was always more
behind what she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) showed, and more and more again behind that. <div class="bookquote">``You know
so, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``where you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU ought to know it indeed then; for isn't what you've been giving
exactly what has brought us together this way? You've been making, as
I've so fully let you know I've felt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said, <div class="bookquote">``the most
precious present I've ever seen made, and if you can't sit down
peacefully on that performance you ARE, no doubt, born to torment
yourself. But you ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wound up, <div class="bookquote">``to be easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not trouble you any more, no doubt--not thrust on you even the
wonder and the beauty of what I've done; only let you regard our
business as over, and well over, and see you depart in a peace that
matches my own? No doubt, no doubt, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) nervously
repeated--<div class="bookquote">``all the more that I don't really pretend I believe you
couldn't, for yourself, NOT have done what you have. I don't pretend
you feel yourself victimised, for this evidently is the way you live,
and it's what--we're agreed--is the best way. Yes, as you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
continued after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``I ought to be easy and rest on my work. Well
then here am I doing so. I AM easy. You'll have it for your last
impression. When is it you say you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) asked with a quick change.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took some time to reply--his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) last impression was more and more so
mixed a one. It produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a vague disappointment, a drop that
was deeper even than the fall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) elation the previous night. The
good of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had done, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had done so much, wasn't there to
enliven him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) quite to the point that would have been ideal for a grand
gay finale. Women were thus endlessly absorbent, and to deal with them
was to walk on water. What was at bottom the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>),
embroider as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might and disclaim as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might--what was at bottom
the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was simply Chad himself. It was of Chad she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was
after all renewedly afraid; the strange strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) passion was the
very strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fear; she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) clung to HIM, Lambert Strether, as to a
source of safety she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had tested, and, generous graceful truthful as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
might try to be, exquisite as she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) dreaded the term of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
being within reach. With this sharpest perception yet, it was like a
chill in the air to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), it was almost appalling, that a creature so
fine could be, by mysterious forces, a creature so exploited. For at
the end of all things they WERE mysterious: she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had but made Chad what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was--so why could she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) think she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) infinite? She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) better, she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) best, she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) anything one would;
but it came to our friend with supreme queerness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was none the
less only Chad. Strether had the sense that HE (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), a little, had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
too; his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) high appreciation had as it were, consecrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) work The
work, however admirable, was nevertheless of the strict human order,
and in short it was marvellous that the companion of mere earthly joys,
of comforts, aberrations -LRB-however one classed them-RRB- within the common
experience should be so transcendently prized. It might have made
Strether hot or shy, as such secrets of others brought home sometimes
do make us; but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was held there by something so hard that it was
fairly grim. This was not the discomposure of last night; that had
quite passed--such discomposures were a detail; the real coercion was
to see a man ineffably adored. There it was again--it took women, it
took women; if to deal with them was to walk on water what wonder that
the water rose? And it had never surely risen higher than round this
woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presently found himself taking a long look from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the
next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had uttered all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``You're afraid for
your life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It drew out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long look, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon enough saw why. A spasm came
into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, the tears she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had already been unable to hide overflowed
at first in silence, and then, as the sound suddenly comes from a
child, quickened to gasps, to sobs. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, giving up all attempt at a manner. <div class="bookquote">``It's how you see me,
it's how you see me'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breath with it--<div class="bookquote">``and it's as I AM,
and as I must take myself, and of course it's no matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) emotion
was at first so incoherent that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only stand there at a loss,
stand with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sense of having upset her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), though of having done it by
the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a silence that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made no
immediate effort to attenuate, feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doubly woeful amid all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
dim diffused elegance; consenting to it as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had consented to the
rest, and even conscious of some vague inward irony in the presence of
such a fine free range of bliss and bale. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't say it was NOT
no matter; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was serving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now knew,
anyway--quite as if what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had nothing to do with it.
It was actually moreover as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't think of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at all, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could think of nothing but the passion, mature, abysmal, pitiful, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
represented, and the possibilities she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) betrayed. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was older for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to-night, visibly less exempt from the touch of time; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was as
much as ever the finest and subtlest creature, the happiest apparition,
it had been given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) years, to meet; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) there as vulgarly troubled, in very truth, as a maidservant crying
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) young man. The only thing was that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) judged herself as the
maidservant wouldn't; the weakness of which wisdom too, the dishonour
of which judgement, seemed but to sink her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lower. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) collapse,
however, no doubt, was briefer and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had in a manner recovered
herself before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intervened. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm afraid for my life. But
that's nothing. It isn't that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was silent a little longer, as if thinking what it might be.
<div class="bookquote">``There's something I have in mind that I can still do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threw off at last, with a sharp sad headshake, drying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes,
what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could still do. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care for that. Of course, as I've
said, you're acting, in your wonderful way, for yourself; and what's
for yourself is no more my business--though I may reach out unholy
hands so clumsily to touch it--than if it were something in Timbuctoo.
It's only that you don't snub me, as you've had fifty chances to
do--it's only your beautiful patience that makes one forget one's
manners. In spite of your patience, all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on, ``you'd
do anything rather than be with us here, even if that were possible.
You'd do everything for us but be mixed up with us--which is a
statement you can easily answer to the advantage of your own manners.
You can say ``What's the use of talking of things that at the best are
impossible?<div class="bookquote">'' What IS of course the use? It's only my little madness.
You'd talk if you were tormented. And I don't mean now about HIM. Oh
for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Positively, strangely, bitterly, as it seemed to Strether,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave <div class="bookquote">``him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for the moment, away. <div class="bookquote">``You don't care what I think of
you; but I happen to care what you think of me. And what you MIGHT,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``What you perhaps even did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) gained time. <div class="bookquote">``What I did--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did think before. Before this. DIDn't you think--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had already stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I didn't think anything. I never
think a step further than I'm obliged to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's perfectly false, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returned--<div class="bookquote">``except that you
may, no doubt, often pull up when things become TOO ugly; or even, I'll
say, to save you a protest, too beautiful. At any rate, even so far as
it's true, we've thrust on you appearances that you've had to take in
and that have therefore made your obligation. Ugly or beautiful--it
doesn't matter what we call them--you were getting on without them, and
that's where we're detestable. We bore you--that's where we are. And
we may well--for what we've cost you. All you can do NOW is not to
think at all. And I who should have liked to seem to you--well,
sublime!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could only after a moment re-echo Miss Barrace. <div class="bookquote">``You're wonderful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm old and abject and hideous'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on as without hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Abject above all. Or old above all. It's when one's old that it's
worst. I don't care what becomes of it--let what WILL; there it is.
It's a doom--I know it; you can't see it more than I do myself. Things
have to happen as they will.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came back again to what,
face to face with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), had so quite broken down. <div class="bookquote">``Of course you
wouldn't, even if possible, and no matter what may happen to you, be
near us. But think of me, think of me--!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exhaled it into air.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took refuge in repeating something he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had already said and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had made nothing of. <div class="bookquote">``There's something I believe I can still do.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand out for good-bye.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again made nothing of it; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) insistence. <div class="bookquote">``That
won't help you. There's nothing to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it may help YOU,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``There's not a grain of certainty in my

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hadn't taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moved with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to the door. <div class="bookquote">``That's
cheerful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``for your benefactor!''

<p/>III


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) purpose had been to see Chad the next day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had prefigured
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) by an early call; having in general never stood on ceremony
in respect to visits at the Boulevard Malesherbes. It had been more
often natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to go there than for Chad to come to the small
hotel, the attractions of which were scant; yet it nevertheless, just
now, at the eleventh hour, did suggest itself to Strether to begin by
giving the young man a chance. It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) that, in the inevitable
course, Chad would be <div class="bookquote">``round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>as Waymarsh used to say--Waymarsh who
already, somehow, seemed long ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't come the day before,
because it had been arranged between them that Madame de Vionnet should
see their friend first; but now that this passage had taken place he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
would present himself, and their friend wouldn't have long to wait.
Strether assumed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) became aware, on this reasoning, that the
interesting parties to the arrangement would have met betimes, and that
the more interesting of the two--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) was after all--would have
communicated to the other the issue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) appeal. Chad would know
without delay that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mother's messenger had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>), and,
though it was perhaps not quite easy to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Waymarsh</b></font>) could qualify what
had occurred, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would at least have been sufficiently advised to feel
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) could go on. The day, however, brought, early or late, no word from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and Strether felt, as a result of this, that a change had
practically come over their intercourse. It was perhaps a premature
judgement; or it only meant perhaps--how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) tell?--that the
wonderful pair he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) protected had taken up again together the excursion
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had accidentally checked. They might have gone back to the country,
and gone back but with a long breath drawn; that indeed would best mark
Chad's sense that reprobation hadn't rewarded Madame de Vionnet's
request for an interview. At the end of the twenty-four hours, at the
end of the forty-eight, there was still no overture; so that Strether
filled up the time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had so often filled it before, by going to
see Miss Gostrey.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) proposed amusements to her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt expert now in proposing
amusements; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had thus, for several days, an odd sense of leading
her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) about Paris, of driving her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in the Bois, of showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) the penny
steamboats--those from which the breeze of the Seine was to be best
enjoyed--that might have belonged to a kindly uncle doing the honours
of the capital to an Intelligent niece from the country. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) found
means even to take her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to shops she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) didn't know, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) pretended
she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) didn't; while she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), on her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) side, was, like the country maiden, all
passive modest and grateful--going in fact so far as to emulate
rusticity in occasional fatigues and bewilderments. Strether described
these vague proceedings to himself, described them even to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), as a
happy interlude; the sign of which was that the companions said for the
time no further word about the matter they had talked of to satiety. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
proclaimed satiety at the outset, and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) quickly took the hint; as
docile both in this and in everything else as the intelligent obedient
niece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) as yet nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) late adventure--for as an
adventure it now ranked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pushed the whole business
temporarily aside and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interest in the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) beautiful
assent. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) left questions unasked--she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) who for so long had been all
questions; she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) gave herself up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) with an understanding of which
mere mute gentleness might have seemed the sufficient expression. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) situation had taken still another step--of that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was quite aware; but she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) conveyed that, whatever had thus happened
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), it was thrown into the shade by what was happening for
herself. This--though it mightn't to a detached spirit have seemed
much--was the major interest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) met it with a new directness of
response, measuring it from hour to hour with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) grave hush of
acceptance. Touched as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had so often been by her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) part too, touched afresh; all the more that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could be duly
aware of the principle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) own mood he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) couldn't be equally so of the
principle of hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knew, that is, in a manner--knew roughly and
resignedly--what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself was hatching; whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had to take the
chance of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) called to himself Maria's calculations. It was all
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) needed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) enough for what they were doing, and even
should they do a good deal more would still like him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) enough for that;
the essential freshness of a relation so simple was a cool bath to the
soreness produced by other relations. These others appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) now
horribly complex; they bristled with fine points, points all
unimaginable beforehand, points that pricked and drew blood; a fact
that gave to an hour with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) present friend on a bateau-mouche, or in
the afternoon shade of the Champs Elysees, something of the innocent
pleasure of handling rounded ivory. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) relation with Chad
personally--from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) point of view--had been of
the simplest; yet this also struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) as bristling, after a third and
a fourth blank day had passed. It was as if at last however his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) care
for such indications had dropped; there came a fifth blank day and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
ceased to enquire or to heed.

<p/>They now took on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) fancy, Miss Gostrey and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), the image of the
Babes in the Wood; they could trust the merciful elements to let them
continue at peace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) had been great already, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) knew, at
postponements; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) had only to get afresh into the rhythm of one to
feel its fine attraction. It amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) to say to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)
might for all the world have been going to die--die resignedly; the
scene was filled for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) with so deep a death-bed hush, so melancholy a
charm. That meant the postponement of everything else--which made so
for the quiet lapse of life; and the postponement in especial of the
reckoning to come--unless indeed the reckoning to come were to be one
and the same thing with extinction. It faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>), the reckoning, over
the shoulder of much interposing experience--which also faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>); and
one would float to it doubtless duly through these caverns of Kubla
Khan. It was really behind everything; it hadn't merged in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) had
done; his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) final appreciation of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) had done--his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) appreciation on
the spot--would provide it with its main sharpness. The spot so
focussed was of course Woollett, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) was to see, at the best, what
Woollett would be with everything there changed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>). Wouldn't THAT
revelation practically amount to the wind-up of his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) career? Well, the
summer's end would show; his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) suspense had meanwhile exactly the
sweetness of vain delay; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) had with it, we should mention, other
pastimes than Maria's company--plenty of separate musings in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>)
luxury failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) but at one point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) was well in port, the outer sea
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>), and it was only a matter of getting ashore. There was a
question that came and went for him (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>), however, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) rested against the
side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) ship, and it was a little to get rid of the obsession that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) prolonged his (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) hours with Miss Gostrey. It was a question about
himself, but it could only be settled by seeing Chad again; it was
indeed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) principal reason for wanting to see Chad. After that it
wouldn't signify--it was a ghost that certain words would easily lay to
rest. Only the young man must be there to take the words. Once they
were taken he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't have a question left; none, that is, in
connexion with this particular affair. It wouldn't then matter even to
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might now have been guilty of speaking BECAUSE of what
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forfeited. That was the refinement of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) supreme scruple--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wished so to leave what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forfeited out of account. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished not
to do anything because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had missed something else, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
sore or sorry or impoverished, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was maltreated or desperate;
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished to do everything because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was lucid and quiet, just the
same for himself on all essential points as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever been. Thus it
was that while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) virtually hung about for Chad he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) kept mutely putting
it: <div class="bookquote">``You've been chucked, old boy; but what has that to do with it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It would have sickened him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to feel vindictive.

<p/>These tints of feeling indeed were doubtless but the iridescence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
idleness, and they were presently lost in a new light from Maria. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
had a fresh fact for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) before the week was out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) practically
met him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) with it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) appearing one night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hadn't on this day seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), but had planned presenting himself in due course to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to
dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) somewhere out of doors, on one of the terraces, in one of
the gardens, of which the Paris of summer was profuse. It had then
come on to rain, so that, disconcerted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) mind; dining
alone at home, a little stuffily and stupidly, and waiting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
afterwards to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) loss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was sure within a minute that
something had happened; it was so in the air of the rich little room
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had scarcely to name his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thought. Softly lighted, the whole
colour of the place, with its vague values, was in cool fusion--an
effect that made the visitor stand for a little agaze. It was as if in
doing so now he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had felt a recent presence--his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) recognition of the
passage of which his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) hostess in turn divined. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had scarcely to say
it--<div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has been here, and this time I received her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>It wasn't
till a minute later that she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``There being, as I understand you,
no reason NOW--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None for your refusing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--if you've done what you've had to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've certainly so far done it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said, <div class="bookquote">``as that you needn't
fear the effect, or the appearance of coming between us. There's
nothing between us now but what we ourselves have put there, and not an
inch of room for anything else whatever. Therefore you're only
beautifully WITH us as always--though doubtless now, if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has talked
to you, rather more with us than less. Of course if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``it was to talk to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was to talk to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria returned; on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was further sure
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was practically in possession of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself hadn't yet
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was even sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was in possession of things he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) himself
couldn't have told; for the consciousness of them was now all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
face and accompanied there with a shade of sadness that marked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
the close of all uncertainties. It came out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) more than ever yet
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had had from the first a knowledge she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) not to
have had, a knowledge the sharp acquisition of which might be destined
to make a difference for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>). The difference for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might not
inconceivably be an arrest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) independence and a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
attitude--in other words a revulsion in favour of the principles of
Woollett. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had really prefigured the possibility of a shock that
would send him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) swinging back to Mrs. Newsome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't, it was true,
week after week, shown signs of receiving it, but the possibility had
been none the less in the air. What Maria accordingly had had now to
take in was that the shock had descended and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hadn't, all the
same, swung back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had grown clear, in a flash, on a point long
since settled for herself; but no reapproximation to Mrs. Newsome had
occurred in consequence. Madame de Vionnet had by her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) visit held up
the torch to these truths, and what now lingered in poor Maria's face
was the somewhat smoky light of the scene between them. If the light
however wasn't, as we have hinted, the glow of joy, the reasons for
this also were perhaps discernible to Strether even through the blur
cast over them by his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) natural modesty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had held herself for months
with a firm hand; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hadn't interfered on any chance--and chances were
specious enough--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) might interfere to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) profit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) back on the dream that Mrs. Newsome's rupture, their
friend's forfeiture--the engagement the relation itself, broken beyond
all mending--might furnish forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) advantage; and, to stay her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) hand
from promoting these things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had on private, difficult, but rigid,
lines, played strictly fair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) couldn't therefore but feel that,
though, as the end of all, the facts in question had been stoutly
confirmed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) ground for personal, for what might have been called
interested, elation remained rather vague. Strether might easily have
made out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had been asking herself, in the hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had just
sat through, if there were still for her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>), or were only not, a fair
shade of uncertainty. Let us hasten to add, however, that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at
first made out on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) also at first kept to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
only asked what in particular Madame de Vionnet had come for, and as to
this his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) companion was ready.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wants tidings of Mr. Newsome, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) appears not to have seen

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hasn't been away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seemed to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria answered, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) might have gone away

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) I know nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I've not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) for a week--and of course I've wondered.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
wonderment showed at this moment as sharper, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) presently went on.
<div class="bookquote">``Still, I dare say I can put my hand on him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). Did she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) strike you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
asked, <div class="bookquote">``as anxious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) appeared to agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) reservation. <div class="bookquote">``I do mind

yourself. I didn't want to have to lie for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I felt that to be too
much for me. A man of course is always expected to do it--to do it, I
mean, for a woman; but not a woman for another woman; unless perhaps on
the tit-for-tat principle, as an indirect way of protecting herself. I
don't need protection, so that I was free to `funk' you--simply to
dodge your test. The responsibility was too much for me. I gained
time, and when I came back the need of a test had blown over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether thought of it serenely. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; when you came back little

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend listened with respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) enumeration of these

in the dust. And as put there by OUR little Chad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria had a pause; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) spoke as if for conscience. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wouldn't

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as if Maria could feel with this then at last that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had done
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) best for each. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had still an idea. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) friend wondered; then with raised eyebrows: <div class="bookquote">``Me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no. Marie de Vionnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) accepted the correction, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wondered still. <div class="bookquote">``Are you so sorry
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) think a moment--made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) even speak with a smile. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>)
didn't really retract. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry for us all!''



 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>IV

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was to delay no longer to re-establish communication with Chad, and
we have just seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had spoken to Miss Gostrey of this intention
on hearing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) of the young man's absence. It was not moreover
only the assurance so given that prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); it was the need of
causing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conduct to square with another profession still--the motive
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had described to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sharpest for now getting away. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was to get away because of some of the relations involved in staying,
the cold attitude toward them might look pedantic in the light of
lingering on. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must do both things; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must see Chad, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must
go. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of the former of these duties the more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt
himself make a subject of insistence of the latter. They were alike
intensely present to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat in front of a quiet little cafe into
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had dropped on quitting Maria's entresol. The rain that had
spoiled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was over; for it was still to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as if
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evening HAD been spoiled--though it mightn't have been wholly the
rain. It was late when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left the cafe, yet not too late; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't
in any case go straight to bed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would walk round by the
Boulevard Malesherbes--rather far round--on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way home. Present
enough always was the small circumstance that had originally pressed
for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the spring of so big a difference--the accident of little
Bilham's appearance on the balcony of the mystic troisieme at the
moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) first visit, and the effect of it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) sense of what
was then before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) watch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) wait, and the
recognition that had proceeded from the young stranger, that had played
frankly into the air and had presently brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) up--things smoothing
the way for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) first straight step. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had since had occasion, a few
times, to pass the house without going in; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) had never passed it
without again feeling how it had then spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) stopped short
to-night on coming to sight of it: it was as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) last day were
oddly copying his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) first. The windows of Chad's apartment were open to
the balcony--a pair of them lighted; and a figure that had come out and
taken up little Bilham's attitude, a figure whose cigarette-spark he (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>)
could see leaned on the rail and looked down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>). It denoted
however no reappearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bilham</b></font>) younger friend; it quickly defined
itself in the tempered darkness as Chad's more solid shape; so that
Chad's was the attention that after he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had stepped forward into the
street and signalled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) easily engaged; Chad's was the voice that,
sounding into the night with promptness and seemingly with joy, greeted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) up.

<p/>That the young man had been visible there just in this position
expressed somehow for Strether that, as Maria Gostrey had reported, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
had been absent and silent; and our friend drew breath on each
landing--the lift, at that hour, having ceased to work--before the
implications of the fact. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been for a week intensely away, away
to a distance and alone; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was more back than ever, and the
attitude in which Strether had surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was something more than a
return--it was clearly a conscious surrender. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had arrived but an
hour before, from London, from Lucerne, from Homburg, from no matter
where--though the visitor's fancy, on the staircase, liked to fill it
out; and after a bath, a talk with Baptiste and a supper of light cold
clever French things, which one could see the remains of there in the
circle of the lamp, pretty and ultra-Parisian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) had come into the air
again for a smoke, was occupied at the moment of Strether's approach in
what might have been called taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) life afresh. His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) life, his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
life!--Strether paused anew, on the last flight, at this final rather
breathless sense of what Chad's life was doing with Chad's mother's
emissary. It was dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), at strange hours, up the staircases of
the rich; it was keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) out of bed at the end of long hot days; it
was transforming beyond recognition the simple, subtle, conveniently
uniform thing that had anciently passed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) for a life of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own.
Why should it concern him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) that Chad was to be fortified in the pleasant
practice of smoking on balconies, of supping on salads, of feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
special conditions agreeably reaffirm themselves, of finding
reassurance in comparisons and contrasts? There was no answer to such
a question but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was still practically committed--he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had perhaps
never yet so much known it. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) feel old, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would buy his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
railway-ticket--feeling, no doubt, older--the next day; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
meanwhile come up four flights, counting the entresol, at midnight and
without a lift, for Chad's life. The young man, hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) by this
time, and with Baptiste sent to rest, was already at the door; so that
Strether had before him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) in full visibility the cause in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was
labouring and even, with the troisieme fairly gained, panting a little.

<p/>Chad offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), as always, a welcome in which the cordial and the
formal--so far as the formal was the respectful--handsomely met; and
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had expressed a hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) up for the
night Strether was in full possession of the key, as it might have been
called, to what had lately happened. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had just thought of himself
as old Chad was at sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as older: he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wanted to
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) up for the night just because he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was ancient and weary. It
could never be said the tenant of these quarters wasn't nice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>); a
tenant who, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might indeed now keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), was probably prepared to
work it all still more thoroughly. Our friend had in fact the
impression that with the minimum of encouragement Chad would propose to
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) indefinitely; an impression in the lap of which one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) own
possibilities seemed to sit. Madame de Vionnet had wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) to
stay--so why didn't that happily fit? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could enshrine himself for
the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) days in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) young host's chambre d'ami and draw out
these days at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) young host's expense: there could scarce be greater
logical expression of the countenance he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had been moved to give. There
was literally a minute--it was strange enough--during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) grasped
the idea that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) WAS acting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) could only act, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was
inconsistent. The sign that the inward forces he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had obeyed really
hung together would be that--in default always of another career--he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
should promote the good cause by mounting guard on it. These things,
during his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) first minutes, came and went; but they were after all
practically disposed of as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) errand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) had
come to say good-bye--yet that was only a part; so that from the moment
Chad accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) farewell the question of a more ideal affirmation
gave way to something else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) proceeded with the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) business.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll be a brute, you know--you'll be guilty of the last infamy--if
you ever forsake her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That, uttered there at the solemn hour, uttered in the place that was
full of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) influence, was the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) business; and when once he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
had heard himself say it he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) message had never before been
spoken. It placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) present call immediately on solid ground, and
the effect of it was to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) quite to play with what we have
called the key. Chad showed no shade of embarrassment, but had none
the less been troubled for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) after their meeting in the country; had
had fears and doubts on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was disturbed,
as it were, only FOR him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and had positively gone away to ease him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) off,
to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) down--if it wasn't indeed rather to screw him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) up--the more
gently. Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) now fairly jaded he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had come, with characteristic
good humour, all the way to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), and what Strether thereupon
supremely made out was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would abound for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to the end in
conscientious assurances. This was what was between them while the
visitor remained; so far from having to go over old ground he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
entertainer keen to agree to everything. It couldn't be put too
strongly for him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)'d be a brute. <div class="bookquote">``Oh rather!--if I should do
anything of THAT sort. I hope you believe I really feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``to be my last word of all to you. I can't
say more, you know; and I don't see how I can do more, in every way,
than I've done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad took this, almost artlessly, as a direct allusion. <div class="bookquote">``You've seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--to say good-bye. And if I had doubted the truth of what I
tell you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)'d have cleared up your doubt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad understood--<div class="bookquote">``rather'' (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>--again!
It even kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) briefly silent. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) made that up. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) must have
been wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) WAS,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether candidly admitted--all of which practically told as
a reference to the conditions created by the accident of the previous
week.

<p/>They appeared for a little to be looking back at it; and that came out
still more in what Chad next said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you've really
thought, all along; I never did know--for anything, with you, seemed to
be possible. But of course--of course--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Without confusion, quite
with nothing but indulgence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) broke down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) pulled up. <div class="bookquote">``After all,
you understand. I spoke to you originally only as I HAD to speak.
There's only one way--isn't there?--about such things. However,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
smiled with a final philosophy, <div class="bookquote">``I see it's all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether met his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes with a sense of multiplying thoughts. What was
it that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) at present, late at night and after journeys, so
renewedly, so substantially young? Strether saw in a moment what it
was--it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was younger again than Madame de Vionnet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
himself said immediately none of the things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was thinking; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>)
said something quite different. <div class="bookquote">``You HAVE really been to a distance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been to England.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad spoke cheerfully and promptly, but gave no
further account of it than to say: <div class="bookquote">``One must sometimes get off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether wanted no more facts--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) only wanted to justify, as it were,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``Of course you do as you're free to do. But I hope,
this time, that you didn't go for ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For very shame at bothering you really too much? My dear man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Chad
laughed, <div class="bookquote">``what WOULDn't I do for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether's easy answer for this was that it was a disposition he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
exactly come to profit by. <div class="bookquote">``Even at the risk of being in your way I've
waited on, you know, for a definite reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad took it in. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--for us to make if possible a still better
impression.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) stood there happily exhaling his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) full general
consciousness. <div class="bookquote">``I'm delighted to gather that you feel we've made it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pleasant irony in the words, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) guest, preoccupied
and keeping to the point, didn't take up. <div class="bookquote">``If I had my sense of
wanting the rest of the time--the time of their being still on this
side,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) continued to explain--<div class="bookquote">``I know now why I wanted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was as grave, as distinct, as a demonstrator before a blackboard,
and Chad continued to face him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) like an intelligent pupil. <div class="bookquote">``You wanted
to have been put through the whole thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether again, for a moment, said nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes away,
and they lost themselves, through the open window, in the dusky outer
air. <div class="bookquote">``I shall learn from the Bank here where they're now having their
letters, and my last word, which I shall write in the morning and which
they're expecting as my ultimatum, will so immediately reach them.''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>The
light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) plural pronoun was sufficiently reflected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
companion's face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) again met it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
demonstration. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) pursued indeed as if for himself. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I've
first to justify what I shall do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're justifying it beautifully!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not a question of advising you not to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether said, <div class="bookquote">``but of
absolutely preventing you, if possible, from so much as thinking of it.
Let me accordingly appeal to you by all you hold sacred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad showed a surprise. <div class="bookquote">``What makes you think me capable--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd not only be, as I say, a brute; you'd be,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion went on
in the same way, <div class="bookquote">``a criminal of the deepest dye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad gave a sharper look, as if to gauge a possible suspicion. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know what should make you think I'm tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether didn't quite know either, and such impressions, for the
imaginative mind, were always too fine, too floating, to produce on the
spot their warrant. There was none the less for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), in the very
manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) host's allusion to satiety as a thinkable motive, a
slight breath of the ominous. <div class="bookquote">``I feel how much more she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) can do for
you. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hasn't done it all yet. Stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) at least till she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And leave her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) THEN?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad had kept smiling, but its effect in Strether was a shade of
dryness. <div class="bookquote">``Don't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) BEFORE. When you've got all that can be
got--I don't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) added a trifle grimly. <div class="bookquote">``That will be the proper
time. But as, for you, from such a woman, there will always be
something to be got, my remark's not a wrong to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad let him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) go
on, showing every decent deference, showing perhaps also a candid
curiosity for this sharper accent. <div class="bookquote">``I remember you, you know, as you
were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An awful ass, wasn't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The response was as prompt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had pressed a spring; it had a
ready abundance at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) even winced; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) took a moment to
meet it. <div class="bookquote">``You certainly then wouldn't have seemed worth all you've let
me in for. You've defined yourself better. Your value has quintupled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, wouldn't that be enough--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad had risked it jocosely, but Strether remained blank. <div class="bookquote">``Enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If one SHOULD wish to live on one's accumulations?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>After which,
however, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend appeared cold to the joke, the young man as
easily dropped it. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I really never forget, night or day,
what I owe her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I owe her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) everything. I give you my word of honour,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) frankly rang out, <div class="bookquote">``that I'm not a bit tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Strether at
this only gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) a stare: the way youth could express itself was
again and again a wonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) meant no harm, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) might after all
be capable of much; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke of being <div class="bookquote">``tired''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) almost as he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
might have spoken of being tired of roast mutton for dinner. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has
never for a moment yet bored me--never been wanting, as the cleverest
women sometimes are, in tact. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has never talked about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tact--as
even they too sometimes talk; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has always had it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has never
had it more'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) handsomely made the point--<div class="bookquote">``than just lately.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
scrupulously went further. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has never been anything I could call a
burden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether for a moment said nothing; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke gravely, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
shade of dryness deepened. <div class="bookquote">``Oh if you didn't do her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) justice--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I SHOULD be a beast, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether devoted no time to saying what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would be; THAT, visibly,
would take them far. If there was nothing for it but to repeat,
however, repetition was no mistake. <div class="bookquote">``You owe her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) everything--very much
more than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can ever owe you. You've in other words duties to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
of the most positive sort; and I don't see what other duties--as the
others are presented to you--can be held to go before them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``And you know of course about the
others, eh?--since it's you yourself who have done the presenting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much of it--yes--and to the best of my ability. But not all--from the
moment your sister took my place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad returned. <div class="bookquote">``Sally took a place, certainly; but it
was never, I saw from the first moment, to be yours. No one--with
us--will ever take yours. It wouldn't be possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>sighed Strether, <div class="bookquote">``I knew it. I believe you're right.
No one in the world, I imagine, was ever so portentously solemn. There
I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added with another sigh, as if weary enough, on occasion, of
this truth. <div class="bookquote">``I was made so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad appeared for a little to consider the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) was made; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might
for this purpose have measured him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) up and down. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) conclusion favoured
the fact. <div class="bookquote">``YOU have never needed any one to make you better. There
has never been any one good enough. They couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man
declared.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) friend hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon. They HAVE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad showed, not without amusement, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) doubt. <div class="bookquote">``Who then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether--though a little dimly--smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Women--too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Two'?'' (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>--Chad stared and laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh I don't believe, for such work,
in any more than one! So you're proving too much. And what IS
beastly, at all events,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``is losing you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had set himself in motion for departure, but at this he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
paused. <div class="bookquote">``Are you afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of doing wrong. I mean away from my eye.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>Before Chad could speak,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had taken himself up. <div class="bookquote">``I AM, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) laughed,
<div class="bookquote">``prodigious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you spoil us for all the stupid--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>This might have been, on
Chad's part, in its extreme emphasis, almost too freely extravagant;
but it was full, plainly enough, of the intention of comfort, it
carried with it a protest against doubt and a promise, positively, of
performance. Picking up a hat in the vestibule he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) came out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
friend, came downstairs, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) arm, affectionately, as to help and
guide him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) if not exactly as aged and infirm, yet as a
noble eccentric who appealed to tenderness, and keeping on with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>),
while they walked, to the next corner and the next. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't tell
me, you needn't tell me!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--this again as they proceeded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) wished to
make Strether feel. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) needn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was now at last, in the
geniality of separation, anything at all it concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) to know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
knew, up to the hilt--that really came over Chad; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) understood, felt,
recorded his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) vow; and they lingered on it as they had lingered in their
walk to Strether's hotel the night of their first meeting. The latter
took, at this hour, all he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could get; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had given all he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had had to
give; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was as depleted as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) last sou. But there
was just one thing for which, before they broke off, Chad seemed
disposed slightly to bargain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) companion needn't, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) said, tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might himself mention that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had been getting some news of
the art of advertisement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) came out quite suddenly with this
announcement while Strether wondered if his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) revived interest were what
had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), with strange inconsequence, over to London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) appeared
at all events to have been looking into the question and had
encountered a revelation. Advertising scientifically worked presented
itself thus as the great new force. <div class="bookquote">``It really does the thing, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>They were face to face under the street-lamp as they had been the first
night, and Strether, no doubt, looked blank. <div class="bookquote">``Affects, you mean, the
sale of the object advertised?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--but affects it extraordinarily; really beyond what one had
supposed. I mean of course when it's done as one makes out that in our
roaring age, it CAN be done. I've been finding out a little, though it
doubtless doesn't amount to much more than what you originally, so
awfully vividly--and all, very nearly, that first night--put before me.
It's an art like another, and infinite like all the arts.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) went on
as if for the joke of it--almost as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) friend's face amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``In the hands, naturally, of a master. The right man must take hold.
With the right man to work it c'est un monde.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether had watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) quite as if, there on the pavement without a
pretext, he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had begun to dance a fancy step. <div class="bookquote">``Is what you're thinking
of that you yourself, in the case you have in mind, would be the right
man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad had thrown back his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) light coat and thrust each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) thumbs into
an armhole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) waistcoat; in which position his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) fingers played up
and down. <div class="bookquote">``Why, what is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but what you yourself, as I say, took me
for when you first came out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether felt a little faint, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) coerced his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) attention. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,
and there's no doubt that, with your natural parts, you'd have much in
common with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Advertising is clearly at this time of day the secret
of trade. It's quite possible it will be open to you--giving the whole
of your mind to it--to make the whole place hum with you. Your
mother's appeal is to the whole of your mind, and that's exactly the
strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad's fingers continued to twiddle, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had something of a drop.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah we've been through my mother's case!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I thought. Why then do you speak of the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only because it was part of our original discussion. To wind up where
we began, my interest's purely platonic. There at any rate the fact
is--the fact of the possible. I mean the money in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh damn the money in it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether. And then as the young man's
fixed smile seemed to shine out more strange: <div class="bookquote">``Shall you give your
friend up for the money in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Chad preserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) handsome grimace as well as the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
attitude. <div class="bookquote">``You're not altogether--in your so great `solemnity'--kind.
Haven't I been drinking you in--showing you all I feel you're worth to
me? What have I done, what am I doing, but cleave to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to the death?
The only thing is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) good-humouredly explained, <div class="bookquote">``that one can't but
have it before one, in the cleaving--the point where the death comes
in. Don't be afraid for THAT. It's pleasant to a fellow's feelings,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) developed, <div class="bookquote">``to `size-up' the bribe he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) applies his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) foot to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh then if all you want's a kickable surface the bribe's enormous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. Then there it goes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad/Chad Newsome/Newsome</b></font>)</div>Chad administered his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) kick with fantastic
force and sent an imaginary object flying. It was accordingly as if
they were once more rid of the question and could come back to what
really concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall see you tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>But Strether scarce heeded the plan proposed for this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had still the
impression--not the slighter for the simulated kick--of an irrelevant
hornpipe or jig. <div class="bookquote">``You're restless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div>returned Chad as they parted, <div class="bookquote">``you're exciting.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Chad</b></font>)</div><p/>V


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had, however, within two days, another separation to face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had
sent Maria Gostrey a word early, by hand, to ask if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) might come to
breakfast; in consequence of which, at noon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) in the
cool shade of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) little Dutch-looking dining-room. This retreat was at
the back of the house, with a view of a scrap of old garden that had
been saved from modern ravage; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had on more than one other
occasion had his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) legs under its small and peculiarly polished table of
hospitality, the place had never before struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) as so sacred to
pleasant knowledge, to intimate charm, to antique order, to a neatness
that was almost august. To sit there was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) hostess
before, to see life reflected for the time in ideally kept pewter;
which was somehow becoming, improving to life, so that one's eyes were
held and comforted. Strether's were comforted at all events now--and
the more that it was the last time--with the charming effect, on the
board bare of a cloth and proud of its perfect surface, of the small
old crockery and old silver, matched by the more substantial pieces
happily disposed about the room. The specimens of vivid Delf, in
particular had the dignity of family portraits; and it was in the midst
of them that our friend resignedly expressed himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke even
with a certain philosophic humour. ``There's nothing more to wait for;
I seem to have done a good day's work. I've let them have it all
round. I've seen Chad, who has been to London and come back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) tells
me I'm ``exciting,<div class="bookquote">'' and I seem indeed pretty well to have upset every
one. I've at any rate excited HIM. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s distinctly restless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've excited ME,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I'M distinctly restless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you were that when I found you. It seems to me I've rather got you
out of it. What's this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but a haunt
of ancient peace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish with all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) presently replied, <div class="bookquote">``I could make you
treat it as a haven of rest.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>On which they fronted each other, across
the table, as if things unuttered were in the air.

<p/>Strether seemed, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) way, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) next spoke, to take some of them
up. <div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't give me--that would be the trouble--what it will, no
doubt, still give you. I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) explained, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
chair, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) eyes on a small ripe round melon--``in real harmony
with what surrounds me. You ARE. I take it too hard. You DON``T. It
makes--that's what it comes to in the end--a fool of me.'' Then at a
tangent, <div class="bookquote">``What has he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) been doing in London?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah one may go to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Maria laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You know I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took the reminder. <div class="bookquote">``And you brought ME back.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) brooded there
opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), but without gloom. <div class="bookquote">``Whom has Chad brought? He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s full
of ideas. And I wrote to Sarah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``the first thing this
morning. So I'm square. I'm ready for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) neglected certain parts of this speech in the interest of others.
<div class="bookquote">``Marie said to me the other day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) to have the makings
of an immense man of business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There it is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'s the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But SUCH a father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah just the right one from that point of view! But it isn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)
father in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether added, <div class="bookquote">``that troubles me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it then?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) breakfast; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) partook presently
of the charming melon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) liberally cut for him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>); and it was only
after this that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) question. Then moreover it was but to
remark that he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)'d answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) presently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) waited, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) watched, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
served him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) and amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>), and it was perhaps with this last idea that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) soon reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) having never even yet named to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) the
article produced at Woollett. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember our talking of it in
London--that night at the play?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) could say yes, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
had put it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) for other matters. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) remember, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
remember--this and that of their first days? He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) remembered everything,
bringing up with humour even things of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) professed no
recollection, things she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) vehemently denied; and falling back above all
on the great interest of their early time, the curiosity felt by both
of them as to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``come out.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They had so assumed it was to
be in some wonderful place--they had thought of it as so very MUCH out.
Well, that was doubtless what it had been--since he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had come out just
there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was out, in truth, as far as it was possible to be, and must
now rather bethink himself of getting in again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) found on the spot
the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) recent history; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was like one of the figures of the
old clock at Berne. THEY came out, on one side, at their hour, jigged
along their little course in the public eye, and went in on the other
side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) too had jigged his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) little course--him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) too a modest retreat
awaited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) offered now, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) really like to know, to name the
great product of Woollett. It would be a great commentary on
everything. At this she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) off; she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) not only had no wish to
know, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wouldn't know for the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had done with the
products of Woollett--for all the good she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had got from them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>)
desired no further news of them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) mentioned that Madame de
Vionnet herself had, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) knowledge, lived exempt from the
information he (<font color='blue'><b>Vionnet</b></font>) was ready to supply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had never consented to receive
it, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have taken it, under stress, from Mrs. Pocock. But
it was a matter about which Mrs. Pocock appeared to have had little to
say--never sounding the word--and it didn't signify now. There was
nothing clearly for Maria Gostrey that signified now--save one sharp
point, that is, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) came in time. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether it's
before you as a possibility that, left to himself, Mr. Chad may after
all go back. I judge that it IS more or less so before you, from what
you just now said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) guest had his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), kindly but attentively, as if foreseeing
what was to follow this. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it will be for the money.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
then as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) seemed uncertain: <div class="bookquote">``I mean I don't believe it will be for
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>)'ll give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) WILL give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Strether waited a moment, rather slow and deliberate now, drawing out a
little this last soft stage, pleading with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) in various suggestive
and unspoken ways for patience and understanding. <div class="bookquote">``What were you just
about to ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) can do that would make you patch it up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With Mrs. Newsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) assent, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) had had a delicacy about sounding the name, was
only in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) face; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) added with it: <div class="bookquote">``Or is there anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Chad</b></font>) can
do that would make HER try it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To patch it up with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) answer came at last in a conclusive
headshake. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing any one can do. It's over. Over for both
of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria wondered, seemed a little to doubt. <div class="bookquote">``Are you so sure for her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--sure now. Too much has happened. I'm different for her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) took it in then, drawing a deeper breath. <div class="bookquote">``I see. So that as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s different for YOU--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah but,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s not.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as Miss Gostrey wondered
again: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s the same. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'s more than ever the same. But I do what
I didn't before--I SEE her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) spoke gravely and as if responsibly--since he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had to pronounce; and
the effect of it was slightly solemn, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) simply exclaimed
<div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Satisfied and grateful, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) showed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) own next
words an acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) statement. <div class="bookquote">``What then do you go home to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) plate a little away, occupied with another side of
the matter; taking refuge verily in that side and feeling so moved that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) soon found himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) was affected in advance by what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) believed might come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) would have liked to forestall
it and deal with it tenderly; yet in the presence of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) wished
still more to be--though as smoothly as possible--deterrent and
conclusive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) question by for the moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) more
about Chad. <div class="bookquote">``It would have been impossible to meet me more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) did
last night on the question of the infamy of not sticking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that what you called it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)--`infamy'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh rather! I described to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) in detail the base creature he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'d be,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) quite agrees with me about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that it's really as if you had nailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite really as if--! I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) I should curse him (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) smiled, <div class="bookquote">``you HAVE done it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then having thought again:
``You CAN<div class="bookquote">``T after that propose--!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) scanned his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Propose again to Mrs. Newsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) hesitated afresh, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) brought it out. <div class="bookquote">``I've never believed,
you know, that you did propose. I always believed it was really
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)--and, so far as that goes, I can understand it. What I mean is,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``that with such a spirit--the spirit of curses!--your
breach is past mending. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) has only to know what you've done to him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
never again to raise a finger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``what I could--one can't do more. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
protests his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) devotion and his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) horror. But I'm not sure I've saved him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) protests too much. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) asks how one can dream of his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) being tired.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) has all life before him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria saw what he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) meant. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s formed to please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it's our friend who has formed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>Strether felt in it the
strange irony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it's scarcely his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fault!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's at any rate his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) danger. I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div>said Strether, <div class="bookquote">``it's hers. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knows it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Strether/Lambert Strether</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knows it. And is your idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div>Miss Gostrey asked, <div class="bookquote">``that there
was some other woman in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Gostrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. No. That is I HAVE no ideas. I'm afraid of them. I've done
with them.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) unanswered question. <div class="bookquote">``To what do you go
home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. There will always be something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To a great difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gostrey</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A great difference--no doubt. Yet I shall see what I can make of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you make anything so good--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Newsome</b></font>)</div>But, as if remembering what Mrs.
Newsome had done, it was as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) went.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had sufficiently understood. <div class="bookquote">``So good as this place at this moment?
So good as what YOU make of everything you touch?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) took a moment to
say, for, really and truly, what stood about him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)
offer--which was as the offer of exquisite service, of lightened care,
for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) days--might well have tempted. It built him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) softly
round, it roofed him (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) warmly over, it rested, all so firm, on selection.
And what ruled selection was beauty and knowledge. It was awkward, it
was almost stupid, not to seem to prize such things; yet, none the
less, so far as they made his (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) opportunity they made it only for a
moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>)'d moreover understand--she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) always understood.

<p/>That indeed might be, but meanwhile she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) was going on. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing,
you know, I wouldn't do for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``in all the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know. I know. But all the same I must go.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) had got it at last.
<div class="bookquote">``To be right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had echoed it in vague deprecation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) felt it already clear
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That, you see, is my only logic. Not, out of the whole
affair, to have got anything for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``But with your wonderful impressions you'll have got a
great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great deal'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Strether</b></font>) agreed. <div class="bookquote">``But nothing like YOU. It's you who would
make me wrong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Honest and fine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) couldn't greatly pretend she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) didn't see it. Still
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) could pretend just a little. <div class="bookquote">``But why should you be so dreadfully
right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the way that--if I must go--you yourself would be the first to
want me. And I can't do anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So then she (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) had to take it, though still with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) defeated protest. <div class="bookquote">``It
isn't so much your BEING `right'--it's your horrible sharp eye for what
makes you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but you're just as bad yourself. You can't resist me when I point
that out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newsome</b></font>) sighed it at last all comically, all tragically, away. <div class="bookquote">``I can't
indeed resist you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there we are!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Strether.
