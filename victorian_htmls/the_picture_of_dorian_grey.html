<p/>The Picture of Dorian Gray

<p/>by

<p/>Oscar Wilde




<p/>THE PREFACE

<p/>The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and
conceal the artist is art's aim. The critic is he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) who can translate
into another manner or a new material his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) impression of beautiful
things.

<p/>The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without
being charming. This is a fault.

<p/>Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the
cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom
beautiful things mean only beauty.

<p/>There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well
written, or badly written. That is all.

<p/>The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing
his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) own face in a glass.

<p/>The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban
not seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part
of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists
in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove
anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has
ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an
unpardonable mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist
can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist
instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for
an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is
the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the
actor's craft is the type. All art is at once surface and symbol.
Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read
the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life,
that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art
shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree,
the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making
a useful thing as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) does not admire it. The only excuse for
making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.

<p/>All art is quite useless.

<p/>OSCAR WILDE




<p/>CHAPTER 1

<p/>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light
summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through
the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate
perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

<p/>From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was
lying, smoking, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry
Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured
blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to
bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then
the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long
tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,
producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) think of
those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of
an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of
swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their
way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous
insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,
seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London
was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.

<p/>In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the
full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,
and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist
himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago
caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many
strange conjectures.

<p/>As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had so
skilfully mirrored in his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) art, a smile of pleasure passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)
face, and seemed about to linger there. But he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) suddenly started up,
and closing his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) eyes, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) fingers upon the lids, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)
sought to imprison within his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) brain some curious dream from which he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)
feared he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) might awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said
Lord Henry languidly. <div class="bookquote">``You must certainly send it next year to the
Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have
gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been
able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that
I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor
is really the only place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I shall send it anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered, tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) head
back in that odd way that used to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) friends laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at
Oxford. <div class="bookquote">``No, I won't send it anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry elevated his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyebrows and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in amazement through
the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``Not send it anywhere? My
dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters
are! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as
you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you,
for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about,
and that is not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you
far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite
jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you will laugh at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``but I really can't exhibit
it. I have put too much of myself into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you
were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with
your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young
Adonis, who looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,
my dear Basil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an
intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends
where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode
of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one
sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something
horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.
How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But
then in the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the
age of eighty what he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was told to say when he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was a boy of eighteen,
and as a natural consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) always looks absolutely delightful.
Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but
whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of
that. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always
here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in
summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter
yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't understand me, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div>answered the artist. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I am
not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry
to look like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the
truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual
distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the
faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one's
fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.
They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing
of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They
live as we all should live--undisturbed, indifferent, and without
disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it
from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they
are--my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks--we
shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian Gray? Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Henry, walking across the
studio towards Basil Hallward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) name. I didn't intend to tell it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their
names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have
grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make
modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is
delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my
people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It
is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great
deal of romance into one's life. I suppose you think me awfully
foolish about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry, <div class="bookquote">``not at all, my dear Basil. You
seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that
it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I
never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.
When we meet--we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go
down to the Duke's--we tell each other the most absurd stories with the
most serious faces. My wife is very good at it--much better, in fact,
than I am. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never gets confused over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dates, and I always do.
But when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does find me out, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) makes no row at all. I sometimes
wish she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) merely laughs at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Basil
Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. <div class="bookquote">``I
believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are
thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary
fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.
Your cynicism is simply a pose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the
garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that
stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over
the polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.

<p/>After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I must be
going, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``and before I go, I insist on your
answering a question I put to you some time ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes fixed on the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you
won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you the real reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of
yourself in it. Now, that is childish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Basil Hallward, looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) straight in the face, <div class="bookquote">``every
portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not
of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is
not he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on
the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit
this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of
my own soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry laughed. <div class="bookquote">``And what is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am all expectation, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) companion, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>answered the painter;
<div class="bookquote">``and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will
hardly believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from
the grass and examined it. <div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure I shall understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,
<div class="bookquote">``and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it
is quite incredible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy
lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the
languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a
blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze
wings. Lord Henry felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could hear Basil Hallward's heart
beating, and wondered what was coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The story is simply this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter after some time. <div class="bookquote">``Two
months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we poor
artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to
remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a
white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain
a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room
about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious
academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at
me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.
When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation
of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some
one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to
do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art
itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know
yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my
own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.
Then--but I don't know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to
tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had
a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and
exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was
not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take
no credit to myself for trying to escape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.
Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either.
However, whatever was my motive--and it may have been pride, for I used
to be very proud--I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course,
I stumbled against Lady Brandon. ``You are not going to run away so
soon, Mr. Hallward?<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) screamed out. You know her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) curiously shrill
voice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hallward</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) is a peacock in everything but beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry,
pulling the daisy to bits with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) long nervous fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) brought me up to royalties, and
people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras
and parrot noses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) spoke of me as her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) dearest friend. I had only
met her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) once before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) took it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) head to lionize me. I
believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at
least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the
nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself
face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely
stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.
It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable.
We would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure
of that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>), too, felt that we were
destined to know each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
companion. <div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) goes in for giving a rapid _precis_ of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
guests. I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old
gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my
ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to
everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I
like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) guests
exactly as an auctioneer treats his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) goods. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) either explains them
entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants
to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward
listlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in
opening a restaurant. How could I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)? But tell me, what did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) say about Mr. Dorian Gray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh, something like, ``Charming boy--poor dear mother and I absolutely
inseparable. Quite forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does--afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--doesn't do
anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr.
Gray?<div class="bookquote">'' Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at
once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far
the best ending for one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>said the young lord, plucking another daisy.

<p/>Hallward shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You don't understand what friendship is,
Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) murmured--<div class="bookquote">``or what enmity is, for that matter. You like
every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How horribly unjust of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, tilting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hat back
and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of
glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the
summer sky. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference
between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my
acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good
intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemies.
I have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some
intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that
very vain of me? I think it is rather vain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must
be merely an acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, brothers! I don't care for brothers. My elder brother won't die,
and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Hallward, frowning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can't help detesting my
relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand
other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize
with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices
of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and
immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of
us makes an ass of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is poaching on their preserves. When
poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite
magnificent. And yet I don't suppose that ten per cent of the
proletariat live correctly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is
more, Harry, I feel sure you don't either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. <div class="bookquote">``How English you are
Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one
puts forward an idea to a true Englishman--always a rash thing to
do--he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong.
The only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) considers of any importance is whether one believes
it oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do
with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the
probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely
intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured
by either his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desires, or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prejudices. However, I don't
propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I
like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no
principles better than anything else in the world. Tell me more about
Mr. Dorian Gray. How often do you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every day. I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is
absolutely necessary to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but
your art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is all my art to me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter gravely. ``I sometimes
think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the
world's history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,
and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.
What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of
Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will
some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), draw from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), sketch from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Of course, I have done all that. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is much
more to me than a model or a sitter. I won't tell you that I am
dissatisfied with what I have done of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), or that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) beauty is such
that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,
and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good
work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way--I wonder
will you understand me?--his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) personality has suggested to me an
entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see
things differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate
life in a way that was hidden from me before. <div class="bookquote">``A dream of form in days
of thought'--who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian
Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
seems to me little more than a lad, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is really over
twenty--his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) merely visible presence--ah! I wonder can you realize all
that that means? Unconsciously he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) defines for me the lines of a fresh
school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic
spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of
soul and body--how much that is! We in our madness have separated the
two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is
void. Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember
that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price
but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have
ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian
Gray sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to me, and
for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I
had always looked for and always missed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After
some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) came back. <div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Dorian Gray is to me simply
a motive in art. You might see nothing in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). I see everything in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is never more present in my work than when no image of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is
there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of
certain colours. That is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why won't you exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) portrait?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of
all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never
cared to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) knows nothing about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) shall never know
anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare
my soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put
under their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing,
Harry--too much of myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion
is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate them for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried Hallward. <div class="bookquote">``An artist should create
beautiful things, but should put nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) own life into them. We
live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of
autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I
will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall
never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you. It is only
the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very
fond of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The painter</b></font>)</div><p/>The painter considered for a few moments. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) likes me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) answered
after a pause; <div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) likes me. Of course I flatter him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that I
know I shall be sorry for having said. As a rule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is charming to
me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and
then, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real
delight in giving me pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away
my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) coat, a bit of decoration to charm his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vanity, an ornament for a
summer's day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you will tire sooner than he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) will. It is a sad thing to think
of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That
accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate
ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have
something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and
facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly
well-informed man--that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the
thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a
_bric-a-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above
its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day
you will look at your friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will seem to you to be a little
out of drawing, or you won't like his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tone of colour, or something.
You will bitterly reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in your own heart, and seriously think
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has behaved very badly to you. The next time he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) calls, you
will be perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for
it will alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance
of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind
is that it leaves one so unromantic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, don't talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of
Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can't feel what I feel. You change
too often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are
faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who
know love's tragedies.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty
silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and
satisfied air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had summed up the world in a phrase. There was
a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,
and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like
swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other
people's emotions were!--much more delightful than their ideas, it
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). One's own soul, and the passions of one's
friends--those were the fascinating things in life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pictured to
himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had missed
by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) aunt's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole
conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the
necessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the
importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity
in their own lives. The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift,
and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was
charming to have escaped all that! As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) aunt, an idea
seemed to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) turned to Hallward and said, <div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,
I have just remembered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remembered what, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>asked Hallward, with a slight frown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>)
told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) in the East End, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to
state that she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) never told me he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was good-looking. Women have no
appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once
pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly
freckled, and tramping about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was
your friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad you didn't, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't want me to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>said the butler, coming into
the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must introduce me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, laughing.

<p/>The painter turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.
<div class="bookquote">``Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The
man bowed and went up the walk.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite
right in what she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Don't spoil him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Don't try to
influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and
has many marvellous people in it. Don't take away from me the one
person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an
artist depends on him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>). Mind, Harry, I trust you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke very
slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense you talk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward
by the arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) almost led him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) into the house.



<p/>CHAPTER 2

<p/>As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was seated at the piano, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann's
<div class="bookquote">``Forest Scenes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Schumann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must lend me these, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Schumann</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I want
to learn them. They are perfectly charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don't want a life-sized portrait of
myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a
wilful, petulant manner. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Schumann</b></font>) caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint
blush coloured his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cheeks for a moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) started up. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your
pardon, Basil, but I didn't know you had any one with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I
have just been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) what a capital sitter you were, and now you
have spoiled everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord
Henry, stepping forward and extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``My aunt has often
spoken to me about you. You are one of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) favourites, and, I am
afraid, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) victims also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in Lady Agatha's black books at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>answered Dorian with a
funny look of penitence. <div class="bookquote">``I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to
have played a duet together--three duets, I believe. I don't know what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is quite devoted to you.
And I don't think it really matters about your not being there. The
audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to
the piano, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) makes quite enough noise for two people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very horrid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>), and not very nice to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>answered Dorian,
laughing.

<p/>Lord Henry looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was certainly wonderfully handsome,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) finely curved scarlet lips, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) frank blue eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) crisp
gold hair. There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) face that made one trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at
once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth's
passionate purity. One felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had kept himself unspotted from
the world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray--far too
charming.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cigarette-case.

<p/>The painter had been busy mixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) colours and getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brushes
ready. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was looking worried, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heard Lord Henry's last
remark, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), hesitated for a moment, and then said,
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it
awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. <div class="bookquote">``Am I to go, Mr. Gray?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please don't, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sulky
moods, and I can't bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sulks. Besides, I want you to tell
me why I should not go in for philanthropy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a
subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I
certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You
don't really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you
liked your sitters to have some one to chat to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.
Dorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hat and gloves. <div class="bookquote">``You are very pressing, Basil,
but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the
Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon
Street. I am nearly always at home at five o'clock. Write to me when
you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray, <div class="bookquote">``if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,
too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is
horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) to stay. I insist upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward,
gazing intently at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) picture. <div class="bookquote">``It is quite true, I never talk when I
am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious
for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what about my man at the Orleans?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The painter</b></font>)</div><p/>The painter laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think there will be any difficulty about
that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,
and don't move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry
says. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has a very bad influence over all his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) friends, with the
single exception of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek
martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
had rather taken a fancy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was so unlike Basil. They made a
delightful contrast. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had such a beautiful voice. After a few
moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Have you really a very bad influence, Lord
Henry? As bad as Basil says?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence
is immoral--immoral from the scientific point of view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because to influence a person is to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) one's own soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) does
not think his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) natural thoughts, or burn with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) natural passions. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
virtues are not real to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) sins, if there are such things as
sins, are borrowed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) becomes an echo of some one else's music, an
actor of a part that has not been written for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). The aim of life is
self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly--that is what each
of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They
have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to
one's self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and
clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage
has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror
of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is
the secret of religion--these are the two things that govern us. And
yet--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good
boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter, deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) work and conscious only that a look
had come into the lad's face that he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had never seen there before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>continued Lord Henry, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) low, musical voice, and with
that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) Eton days, <div class="bookquote">``I believe that if one man
were to live out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life fully and completely, were to give form to
every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream--I
believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we
would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the
Hellenic ideal--to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it
may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The
mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial
that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse
that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body
sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of
purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,
or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is
to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for
the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its
monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that
the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the
brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place
also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your
rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,
thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping
dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>faltered Dorian Gray, <div class="bookquote">``stop! you bewilder me. I don't know
what to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don't
speak. Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>For nearly ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stood there, motionless, with parted lips and
eyes strangely bright. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was dimly conscious that entirely fresh
influences were at work within him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Yet they seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to have
come really from himself. The few words that Basil's friend had said
to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in
them--had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,
but that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.

<p/>Music had stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) like that. Music had troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) many times.
But music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather
another chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How
terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not
escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They
seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to
have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere
words! Was there anything so real as words?

<p/>Yes; there had been things in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) boyhood that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had not understood.
He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been walking in fire. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) not
known it?

<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knew the precise
psychological moment when to say nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt intensely
interested. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was amazed at the sudden impression that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) words had
produced, and, remembering a book that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had read when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was sixteen,
a book which had revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had not known before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How
fascinating the lad was!

<p/>Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), that had
the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes
only from strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was unconscious of the silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Basil, I am tired of standing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``I must
go out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can't think of
anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still.
And I have caught the effect I wanted--the half-parted lips and the
bright look in the eyes. I don't know what Harry has been saying to
you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression.
I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has been paying you compliments. You mustn't believe a
word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the
reason that I don't believe anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you believe it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
dreamy languorous eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I will go out to the garden with you. It is
horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to
drink, something with strawberries in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I
will join you later on. Don't keep Dorian too long. I have never been
in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my
masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their
perfume as if it had been wine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) came close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``You are quite right to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) murmured.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the
senses but the soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lad</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad started and drew back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was bareheaded, and the leaves had
tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads.
There was a look of fear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes, such as people have when they are
suddenly awakened. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some
hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lips and left them trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>continued Lord Henry, <div class="bookquote">``that is one of the great secrets of
life--to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means
of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you
think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray frowned and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) could not help liking
the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) romantic,
olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). There was
something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They
moved, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their
own. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), and ashamed of being afraid. Why had
it been left for a stranger to reveal him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to himself? He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had known
Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never
altered him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). Suddenly there had come some one across his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) life who
seemed to have disclosed to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) life's mystery. And, yet, what was
there to be afraid of? He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was
absurd to be frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go and sit in the shade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Parker has brought
out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be
quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must
not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can it matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sat down on
the seat at the end of the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing
worth having.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel that, Lord Henry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you don't feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled
and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and
passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you
will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world.
Will it always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr.
Gray. Don't frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius--is
higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the
great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the
reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It
cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It
makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost
it you won't smile... People say sometimes that beauty is only
superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as
thought is. To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only
shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of
the world is the visible, not the invisible... Yes, Mr. Gray, the
gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take
away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly,
and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then
you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or
have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of
your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes
brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and
wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and
hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly... Ah!
realize your youth while you have it. Don't squander the gold of your
days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure,
or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar.
These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live
the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be
always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing... A new
Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible
symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do. The
world belongs to you for a season... The moment I met you I saw that
you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really
might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must
tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if
you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will
last--such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they
blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now.
In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after
year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we
never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty
becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into
hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were
too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the
courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in
the world but youth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it
for a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated
globe of the tiny blossoms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) watched it with that strange interest
in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import
make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we
cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays
sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the
bee flew away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian
convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to
and fro.

<p/>Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made
staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and
smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Do come in. The light is quite perfect,
and you can bring your drinks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white
butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of
the garden a thrush began to sing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.
Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to
make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only
difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice
lasts a little longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand upon Lord Henry's
arm. <div class="bookquote">``In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) murmured,
flushing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and
resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) pose.

<p/>Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that
broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back
to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) work from a distance. In the slanting beams that
streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The
heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.

<p/>After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for
a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,
biting the end of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) huge brushes and frowning. <div class="bookquote">``It is quite
finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cried at last, and stooping down he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) name in
long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.

<p/>Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a
wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is the
finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lad</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it really finished?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) murmured, stepping down from the platform.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter. <div class="bookquote">``And you have sat splendidly
to-day. I am awfully obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is entirely due to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>broke in Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it, Mr.
Gray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) picture
and turned towards it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) saw it he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) drew back, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cheeks
flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) eyes,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had recognized himself for the first time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) stood there
motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), but not catching the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) words. The sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own
beauty came on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) like a revelation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had never felt it before.
Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) to be merely the
charming exaggeration of friendship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had listened to them, laughed
at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) nature. Then had
come Lord Henry Wotton with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) strange panegyric on youth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) at the time, and
now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) stood gazing at the shadow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own loveliness, the full
reality of the description flashed across him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). Yes, there would be a
day when his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) face would be wrinkled and wizen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) eyes dim and
colourless, the grace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) figure broken and deformed. The scarlet
would pass away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) lips and the gold steal from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hair. The
life that was to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) soul would mar his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would become
dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) like a
knife and made each delicate fibre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) nature quiver. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) eyes
deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) felt
as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the
lad's silence, not understanding what it meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) likes it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Who wouldn't like it? It
is one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything
you like to ask for it. I must have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not my property, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose property is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian's, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>answered the painter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is a very lucky fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How sad it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>murmured Dorian Gray with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes still fixed upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own portrait. <div class="bookquote">``How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and
dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be
older than this particular day of June... If it were only the other
way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was
to grow old! For that--for that--I would give everything! Yes, there
is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul
for that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord
Henry, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``It would be rather hard lines on your work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should object very strongly, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward.

<p/>Dorian Gray turned and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I believe you would, Basil.
You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a
green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The painter</b></font>)</div><p/>The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like
that. What had happened? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) seemed quite angry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) face was flushed
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cheeks burning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your
silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me?
Till I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one
loses one's good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything.
Your picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right.
Youth is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing
old, I shall kill myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward turned pale and caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian! Dorian!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) cried,
<div class="bookquote">``don't talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I
shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,
are you?--you who are finer than any of them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of
the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must
lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives
something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture
could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint
it? It will mock me some day--mock me horribly!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The hot tears welled
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) tore his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hand away and, flinging himself on the
divan, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) face in the cushions, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was praying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is your doing, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter bitterly.

<p/>Lord Henry shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``It is the real Dorian Gray--that
is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is not, what have I to do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have gone away when I asked you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) muttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I stayed when you asked me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>was Lord Henry's answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, I can't quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between
you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever
done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will
not let it come across our three lives and mar them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) golden head from the pillow, and with pallid
face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) walked over to the deal
painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What
was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) doing there? His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) fingers were straying about among the litter
of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for
the long palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had
found it at last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was going to rip up the canvas.

<p/>With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to
Hallward, tore the knife out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hand, and flung it to the end of
the studio. <div class="bookquote">``Don't, Basil, don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``It would be murder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter
coldly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought you
would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I
feel that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and
sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) walked
across the room and rang the bell for tea. <div class="bookquote">``You will have tea, of
course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such
simple pleasures?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I adore simple pleasures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``They are the last refuge
of the complex. But I don't like scenes, except on the stage. What
absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man
as a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given.
Man is many things, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is not rational. I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is not, after
all--though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You
had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn't really
want it, and I really do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray; <div class="bookquote">``and I don't allow people to call me a silly boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it
existed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you
don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! this morning! You have lived since then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div><p/>There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden
tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a
rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.
Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray
went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to
the table and examined what was under the covers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go to the theatre to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``There is sure
to be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White's, but
it is only with an old friend, so I can send him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a wire to say that I
am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a
subsequent engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it
would have all the surprise of candour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is such a bore putting on one's dress-clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>muttered Hallward.
<div class="bookquote">``And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry dreamily, <div class="bookquote">``the costume of the nineteenth
century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the
only real colour-element left in modern life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the
one in the picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Before either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the
lad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like that awfully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>painter</b></font>)</div><p/>The painter bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall stay with the real Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it the real Dorian?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried the original of the portrait, strolling
across to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Am I really like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you are just like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How wonderful, Basil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>sighed Hallward. <div class="bookquote">``That is something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fuss people make about fidelity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Why,
even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to
do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old
men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward. <div class="bookquote">``Stop and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) won't like you the better for keeping your promises. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) always
breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) own. I beg you not to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray laughed and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I entreat you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lad</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them
from the tea-table with an amused smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) went over and laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) cup on
the tray. <div class="bookquote">``It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't forget?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, of course not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And ... Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Basil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have forgotten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could trust myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Mr.

Good-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div><p/>As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a
sofa, and a look of pain came into his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) face.



<p/>CHAPTER 3

<p/>At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon
Street over to the Albany to call on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial
if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called
selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>), but who was
considered generous by Society as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) fed the people who amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young
and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a
capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at
Paris, a post to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) was fully entitled by
reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) birth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) indolence, the good English of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) dispatches,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>)
father's secretary, had resigned along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) chief, somewhat
foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months
later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great
aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) had two large town
houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and
took most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) meals at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) club. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) paid some attention to the
management of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself
for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of
having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of
burning wood on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own hearth. In politics he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a Tory, except when
the Tories were in office, during which period he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) roundly abused them
for being a pack of Radicals. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a hero to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) valet, who bullied
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and a terror to most of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) relations, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bullied in turn.
Only England could have produced him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) always said that the
country was going to the dogs. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) principles were out of date, but
there was a good deal to be said for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) prejudices.

<p/>When Lord Henry entered the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) uncle sitting in a rough
shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``what brings you out so early? I
thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till
five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get
something out of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Money, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Fermor</b></font>)</div>said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. <div class="bookquote">``Well, sit
down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine that
money is everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry, settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) button-hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) coat; <div class="bookquote">``and
when they grow older they know it. But I don't want money. It is only
people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay
mine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly
upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor's tradesmen, and
consequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not
useful information, of course; useless information.''

 (<font color='red'><b>button-hole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,
although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in
the Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let them in
now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure
humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows quite
enough, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is not a gentleman, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows is bad for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said
Lord Henry languidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Fermor</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Fermor, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bushy
white eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know
who he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) is the last Lord Kelso's grandson. His (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) mother was a
Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>)
mother. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) like? Whom did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) marry? You have known nearly
everybody in your time, so you might have known her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I am very much
interested in Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kelso's grandson!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>echoed the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Kelso's grandson! ...
Of course... I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) mother intimately. I believe I was at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
christening. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret
Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless
young fellow--a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or
something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if
it happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few
months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They
said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) son-in-law in public--paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>), sir, to do it, paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>)--and that
the fellow spitted his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) man as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been a pigeon. The thing was
hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) chop alone at the club for some
time afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) daughter back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>), I was told,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) never spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The
girl died, too, died within a year. So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left a son, did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? I had
forgotten that. What sort of boy is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
must be a good-looking chap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is very good-looking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>assented Lord Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will fall into proper hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>continued the old man. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
should have a pot of money waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) if Kelso did the right thing
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) mother had money, too. All the Selby property came to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandfather. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandfather hated Kelso, thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>)
a mean dog. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad,
I was ashamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>). The Queen used to ask me about the English noble
who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They
made quite a story of it. I didn't dare show my face at Court for a
month. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) treated his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) grandson better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) did the jarvies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``I fancy that the boy will be
well off. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is not of age yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has Selby, I know. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told me so.
And ... his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother was very beautiful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,
Harry. What on earth induced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to behave as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did, I never could
understand. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could have married anybody she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chose. Carlington was
mad after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was romantic, though. All the women of that family
were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.
Carlington went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Told me so himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and there wasn't a girl in London at the time who wasn't after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is
this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an
American? Ain't English girls good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll back English women against the world, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Fermor</b></font>)</div>said Lord Fermor,
striking the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fermor</b></font>) fist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The betting is on the Americans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't last, I am told,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>muttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fermor</b></font>) uncle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a
steeplechase. They take things flying. I don't think Dartmoor has a
chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) people?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>grumbled the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) got any?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``American girls are as clever at concealing
their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said,
rising to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are pork-packers, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor's sake. I am told that
pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after
politics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) behaves as if she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was beautiful. Most American women do. It is
the secret of their charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't these American women stay in their own country? They are
always telling us that it is the paradise for women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively
anxious to get out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Uncle George.
I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me
the information I wanted. I always like to know everything about my
new friends, and nothing about my old ones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you lunching, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Aunt Agatha's. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) latest
_protege_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks
that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) silly fads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Uncle George, I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but it won't have any effect.
Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their
distinguishing characteristic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
servant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street
and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.

<p/>So that was the story of Dorian Gray's parentage. Crudely as it had
been told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), it had yet stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) by its suggestion of a
strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything
for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a
hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a
child born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to
solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an
interesting background. It posed the lad, made him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) more perfect, as it
were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something
tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might
blow... And how charming he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had been at dinner the night before, as
with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had sat
opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer
rose the wakening wonder of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face. Talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was like playing
upon an exquisite violin. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) answered to every touch and thrill of the
bow... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of
influence. No other activity was like it. To project one's soul into
some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one's
own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of
passion and youth; to convey one's temperament into another as though
it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in
that--perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited
and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and
grossly common in its aims... He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was a marvellous type, too, this lad,
whom by so curious a chance he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had met in Basil's studio, or could be
fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), and the
white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for
us. There was nothing that one could not do with him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) could be
made a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was
destined to fade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view,
how interesting he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of
looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence
of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in
dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing
herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) soul who sought for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are
wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things
becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value,
as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect
form whose shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
remembered something like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist
in thought, who had first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had
carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own
century it was strange... Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>) would try to be to Dorian Gray
what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned
the wonderful portrait. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would seek to dominate him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)--had already,
indeed, half done so. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would make that wonderful spirit his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own.
There was something fascinating in this son of love and death.

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) stopped and glanced up at the houses. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had
passed his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) aunt's some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) that they
had gone in to lunch. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) gave one of the footmen his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) hat and stick and
passed into the dining-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Late as usual, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) aunt, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) head at him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shyly from
the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cheek.
Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and
good temper, much liked by every one who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>), and of those ample
architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are
described by contemporary historians as stoutness. Next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) sat, on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Burdon</b></font>) leader in public life and in private life followed the
best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in
accordance with a wise and well-known rule. The post on her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) left was
occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable
charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,
having, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>)
had to say before he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) was thirty. His (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur,
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) aunt's oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so
dreadfully dowdy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vandeleur</b></font>) reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.
Fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Vandeleur</b></font>) had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most
intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement
in the House of Commons, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Vandeleur</b></font>) was conversing in that intensely
earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) remarked once
himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of
them ever quite escape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>cried the duchess,
nodding pleasantly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) across the table. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will
really marry this fascinating young person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has made up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind to propose to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), Duchess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agatha/Agatha</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Agatha. <div class="bookquote">``Really, some one should
interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am told, on excellent authority, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) father keeps an American
dry-goods store,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>asked the duchess, raising
her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``American novels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.

<p/>The duchess looked puzzled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agatha/Agatha</b></font>)</div>whispered Lady Agatha. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) never means
anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When America was discovered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Radical</b></font>)</div>said the Radical member--and he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) began to
give some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a
subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) exhausted his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised
her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) privilege of interruption. <div class="bookquote">``I wish to goodness it never had been
discovered at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Really, our girls have no chance
nowadays. It is most unfair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Erskine</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Erskine; <div class="bookquote">``I myself would say that it had merely been detected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Erskine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>answered the
duchess vaguely. <div class="bookquote">``I must confess that most of them are extremely
pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in
Paris. I wish I could afford to do the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div>chuckled Sir
Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off clothes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>inquired the
duchess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They go to America,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry.

<p/>Sir Thomas frowned. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced
against that great country,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) said to Lady Agatha. <div class="bookquote">``I have travelled
all over it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters,
are extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Erskine</b></font>)</div>asked Mr.
Erskine plaintively. <div class="bookquote">``I don't feel up to the journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Thomas waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about
them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are
absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing
characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I
assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``I can stand brute force, but brute
reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use.
It is hitting below the intellect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, Lord Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Erskine</b></font>)</div>murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paradoxes are all very well in their way...''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>rejoined the baronet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that a paradox?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Erskine</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Erskine. <div class="bookquote">``I did not think so. Perhaps
it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test
reality we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become
acrobats, we can judge them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agatha/Agatha</b></font>)</div>said Lady Agatha, <div class="bookquote">``how you men argue! I am sure I never can
make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with
you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up
the East End? I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) would be quite invaluable. They would
love his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) playing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agatha/Agatha</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to play to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked
down the table and caught a bright answering glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agatha/Agatha</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Agatha.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can sympathize with everything except suffering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry,
shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot sympathize with that. It is too
ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly
morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with
the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life's
sores, the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, the East End is a very important problem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div>remarked Sir Thomas
with a grave shake of the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>answered the young lord. <div class="bookquote">``It is the problem of slavery,
and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The politician</b></font>)</div><p/>The politician looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) keenly. <div class="bookquote">``What change do you propose,
then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Lord Henry laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I don't desire to change anything in England
except the weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I am quite content with philosophic
contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt
through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should
appeal to science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is
that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is
not emotional.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we have such grave responsibilities,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vandeleur</b></font>)</div>ventured Mrs. Vandeleur
timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Terribly grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agatha/Agatha</b></font>)</div>echoed Lady Agatha.

<p/>Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. <div class="bookquote">``Humanity takes itself too
seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the caveman had known
how to laugh, history would have been different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are really very comforting,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>warbled the duchess. <div class="bookquote">``I have always
felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no
interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to
look her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) in the face without a blush.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A blush is very becoming, Duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>remarked Lord Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only when one is young,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``When an old woman like myself
blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell
me how to become young again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Can you remember any great error that you
committed in your early days, Duchess?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) across
the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A great many, I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then commit them over again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said gravely. <div class="bookquote">``To get back one's
youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A delightful theory!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I must put it into practice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A dangerous theory!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div>came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady Agatha
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that is one of the great secrets of life.
Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and
discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are
one's mistakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A laugh ran round the table.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and
transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent
with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) went
on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and
catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>)
wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the
hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) like frightened forest things. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) white feet trod the huge
press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over
the vat's black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary
improvisation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>),
and the consciousness that amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) audience there was one whose
temperament he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wished to fascinate seemed to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wit keenness and
to lend colour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) imagination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was brilliant, fantastic,
irresponsible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) charmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) listeners out of themselves, and they
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) gaze off him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>),
but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lips
and wonder growing grave in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) darkening eyes.

<p/>At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room
in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) carriage was
waiting. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) hands in mock despair. <div class="bookquote">``How annoying!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)
cried. <div class="bookquote">``I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Willis</b></font>) is going to be
in the chair. If I am late he (<font color='blue'><b>Willis</b></font>) is sure to be furious, and I couldn't
have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word
would ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you
are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I don't
know what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some
night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry with a
bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``so mind you
come'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the
other ladies.

<p/>When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking
a chair close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>), placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk books away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``why don't you write one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I
should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely
as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is no literary public in
England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias.
Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the
beauty of literature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear you are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Erskine</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Erskine. <div class="bookquote">``I myself used to have
literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear
young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you
really meant all that you said to us at lunch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite forget what I said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>smiled Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Was it all very bad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if
anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being
primarily responsible. But I should like to talk to you about life.
The generation into which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you
are tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your
philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate
enough to possess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege.
It has a perfect host, and a perfect library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will complete it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>answered the old gentleman with a courteous
bow. <div class="bookquote">``And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at
the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All of you, Mr. Erskine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English
Academy of Letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry laughed and rose. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to the park,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cried.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) on the arm.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me come with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do
let me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks
so wonderfully as you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with
me, if you care to.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 4

<p/>One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious
arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair. It
was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled
wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling
of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,
long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette
by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for
Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies
that Queen had selected for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) device. Some large blue china jars and
parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small
leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a
summer day in London.

<p/>Lord Henry had not yet come in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was always late on principle, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was
looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) turned over the pages
of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had
found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the
Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>). Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) thought of going
away.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) heard a step outside, and the door opened. <div class="bookquote">``How late you
are, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>answered a shrill voice.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) glanced quickly round and rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon. I
thought--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought it was my husband. It is only his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. You must let me
introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think
my husband has got seventeen of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not seventeen, Lady Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the other night at the
opera.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) laughed nervously as she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) spoke, and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)
vague forget-me-not eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) was a curious woman, whose dresses
always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a
tempest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) was usually in love with somebody, and, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) passion
was never returned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) had kept all her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) illusions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) tried to look
picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) name was
Victoria, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) had a perfect mania for going to church.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner's music better than
anybody's. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other
people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, don't you
think so, Mr. Gray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>) thin lips, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Manon</b></font>)
fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.

<p/>Dorian smiled and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head: <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I don't think so, Lady
Henry. I never talk during music--at least, during good music. If one
hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray? I always hear
Harry's views from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friends. It is the only way I get to know of
them. But you must not think I don't like good music. I adore it, but
I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped
pianists--two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don't know what
it is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all
are, ain't they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners
after a time, don't they? It is so clever of them, and such a
compliment to art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it? You have
never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I
can't afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make
one's rooms look so picturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in
to look for you, to ask you something--I forget what it was--and I
found Mr. Gray here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We
have quite the same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) has been most pleasant. I am so glad I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).''

smile. <div class="bookquote">``So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of
old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it.
Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I must be going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Henry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an
awkward silence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) silly sudden laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I have promised to drive
with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the
rain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of
frangipanni. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the
sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said after a

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they are so sentimental.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one has. People will some day, however. She (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) is a genius.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, how can you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so
I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was.
I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain
and the coloured. The plain women are very useful. If you want to
gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down
to supper. The other women are very charming. They commit one
mistake, however. They paint in order to try and look young. Our
grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly. _Rouge_ and
_esprit_ used to go together. That is all over now. As long as a woman
can look ten years younger than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is perfectly
satisfied. As for conversation, there are only five women in London
worth talking to, and two of these can't be admitted into decent
society. However, tell me about your genius. How long have you known
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Harry, your views terrify me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where did you come across her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn't be unsympathetic about it.
After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You
filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For days
after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged
in the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one
who passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they
led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There
was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations...
Well, one evening about seven o'clock, I determined to go out in search
of some adventure. I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours,
with its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins,
as you once phrased it, must have something in store for me. I fancied
a thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I
remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we
first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret
of life. I don't know what I expected, but I went out and wandered
eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black
grassless squares. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little
theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous
Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was
standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had greasy
ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled
shirt. ``Have a box, my Lord?<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) took off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hat with an air of gorgeous servility. There was something about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), Harry, that amused me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was such a monster. You will laugh at
me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the
stage-box. To the present day I can't make out why I did so; and yet if
I hadn't--my dear Harry, if I hadn't--I should have missed the greatest
romance of my life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you
should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the
first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will
always be in love with love. A _grande passion_ is the privilege of
people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes
of a country. Don't be afraid. There are exquisite things in store
for you. This is merely the beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think my nature so shallow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I think your nature so deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really
the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity,
I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.
Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life
of the intellect--simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I
must analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There
are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that
others might pick them up. But I don't want to interrupt you. Go on
with your story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a
vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the
curtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and
cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were
fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and
there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the
dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there
was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder
what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill. What
do you think the play was, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Idiot</b></font>)</div><p/>``I should think ``The Idiot Boy', or <div class="bookquote">``Dumb but Innocent'. Our fathers
used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian,
the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is
not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandperes ont
toujours tort_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Idiot Boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I
must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare
done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in
a sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act.
There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat
at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the
drop-scene was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly
gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure
like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) was played by the
low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) own and was on most
friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the
scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But
Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a
little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of
dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were
like the petals of a rose. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was the loveliest thing I had ever seen
in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that
beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,
Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came
across me. And her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice--I never heard such a voice. It was very low
at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one's
ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a
distant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy
that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There
were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You
know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane
are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear
them, and each of them says something different. I don't know which to
follow. Why should I not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>)? Harry, I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) is
everything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) play. One
evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) is Rosalind, and the next evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) is Imogen. I have
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) lover's lips. I have watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) wandering through the forest of
Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and
given him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) has been
innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) reedlike
throat. I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) in every age and in every costume. Ordinary
women never appeal to one's imagination. They are limited to their
century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as
easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is
no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and
chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped
smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an
actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didn't you tell me
that the only thing worth loving is an actress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary
charm in them, sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life
you will tell me everything you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things.
You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would
come and confess it to you. You would understand me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People like you--the wilful sunbeams of life--don't commit crimes,
Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And
now tell me--reach me the matches, like a good boy--thanks--what are
your actual relations with Sibyl Vane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray leaped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said
Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``But why
should you be annoyed? I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) will belong to you some day.
When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's self, and one

romance. You know her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), at any rate, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). On the first night I was at the theatre, the
horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and
offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). I was
furious with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) that Juliet had been dead for hundreds
of years and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I
think, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) blank look of amazement, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was under the
impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not surprised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) I
never even read them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) seemed terribly disappointed at that, and
confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), and that they were every one of them to be bought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was quite right there. But, on the other
hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all
expensive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) seemed to think they were beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>laughed Dorian.
``By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre,
and I had to go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) wanted me to try some cigars that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) strongly
recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the
place again. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) saw me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) made me a low bow and assured me that
I was a munificent patron of art. He (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) was a most offensive brute,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) told me
once, with an air of pride, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) five bankruptcies were entirely
due to ``The Bard,<div class="bookquote">'' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) insisted on calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) seemed to think
it a distinction.''

me--at least I fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had. The old Jew was persistent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)

her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) what I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) performance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) seemed quite unconscious
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) power. I think we were both rather nervous. The old Jew stood
grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate
speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like
children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) would insist on calling me ``My Lord,'' so I had to assure

only for a single act. I get hungry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) presence; and when I think
of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``To-night she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is Imogen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How horrid you are! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is all the great heroines of the world in
one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
has genius. I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), and I must make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) love me. You, who know
all the secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I
want to make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to
hear our laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir
their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God,
Harry, how I worship her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was walking up and down the room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
spoke. Hectic spots of red burned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cheeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was terribly
excited.

<p/>Lord Henry watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was now from the shy frightened boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had met in Basil Hallward's
studio! His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of
scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) soul, and
desire had come to meet it on the way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you propose to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) act. I
have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to
acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) genius. Then we must get her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) out of the Jew's hands.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is bound to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) for three years--at least for two years and eight
months--from the present time. I shall have to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) something, of
course. When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) out properly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) will make the world as mad as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) has made
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be impossible, my dear boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) has personality also; and you have often told me that it
is personalities, not principles, that move the age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what night shall we go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) plays
Juliet to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right. The Bristol at eight o'clock; and I will get Basil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there before the
curtain rises. You must see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) in the first act, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) meets
Romeo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or

seven. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I write to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) for a week. It is rather
horrid of me, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful
frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous
of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit
that I delight in it. Perhaps you had better write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). I don't
want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) says things that annoy me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) gives me good
advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry smiled. <div class="bookquote">``People are very fond of giving away what they need
most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) seems to me to be just a bit
of a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
work. The consequence is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) has nothing left for life but his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
prejudices, his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) principles, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) common sense. The only artists I
have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good
artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly
uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is
the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are
absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more
picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of
second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives the
poetry that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot write. The others write the poetry that they
dare not realize.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder is that really so, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian Gray, putting some
perfume on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that
stood on the table. <div class="bookquote">``It must be, if you say it. And now I am off.
Imogen is waiting for me. Don't forget about to-morrow. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) began
to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) so much as
Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else caused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was pleased by
it. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) a more interesting study. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had been always
enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary
subject-matter of that science had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) trivial and of no
import. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had begun by vivisecting himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had ended by
vivisecting others. Human life--that appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) the one thing
worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any
value. It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of
pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass,
nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the
imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There
were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken
of them. There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through
them if one sought to understand their nature. And, yet, what a great
reward one received! How wonderful the whole world became to one! To
note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life
of the intellect--to observe where they met, and where they separated,
at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at
discord--there was a delight in that! What matter what the cost was?
One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was conscious--and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
brown agate eyes--that it was through certain words of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), musical
words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had turned
to this white girl and bowed in worship before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). To a large extent
the lad was his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own creation. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) premature. That was
something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its
secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were
revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect
of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately
with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex
personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,
in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,
just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.

<p/>Yes, the lad was premature. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was gathering his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) harvest while it was
yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was
becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). With his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
beautiful face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) beautiful soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was a thing to wonder at.
It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was like
one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem
to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of beauty,
and whose wounds are like red roses.

<p/>Soul and body, body and soul--how mysterious they were! There was
animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.
The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could
say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began?
How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!
And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various
schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the
body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of
spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter
was a mystery also.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>) began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a
science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it
was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.
Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to
their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of
warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation
of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow
and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in
experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.
All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same
as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we
would do many times, and with joy.

<p/>It was clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that the experimental method was the only method by
which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and
certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand, and seemed to
promise rich and fruitful results. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane
was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no
doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire
for new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex
passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of
boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,
changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from
sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the
passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most
strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we
were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were
experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.

<p/>While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the
door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) valet entered and reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) it was time to dress for
dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) got up and looked out into the street. The sunset had
smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite.
The panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like a
faded rose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) friend's young fiery-coloured life and
wondered how it was all going to end.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw a telegram
lying on the hall table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opened it and found it was from Dorian
Gray. It was to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was engaged to be married to Sibyl
Vane.



<p/>CHAPTER 5

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, Mother, I am so happy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>whispered the girl, burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) face
in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to
the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their
dingy sitting-room contained. <div class="bookquote">``I am so happy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``and you
must be happy, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Vane winced and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>)
daughter's head. <div class="bookquote">``Happy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) echoed, <div class="bookquote">``I am only happy, Sibyl, when I
see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr.
Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl looked up and pouted. <div class="bookquote">``Money, Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``what does
money matter? Love is more than money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to
get a proper outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty
pounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) talks to me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, rising to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet and going over to the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how we could manage without him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>answered the elder
woman querulously.

<p/>Sibyl Vane tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) head and laughed. <div class="bookquote">``We don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) any more,
Mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) paused. A
rose shook in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) blood and shadowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) cheeks. Quick breath parted
the petals of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion
swept over her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) and stirred the dainty folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) dress. <div class="bookquote">``I love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) said simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Foolish child! foolish child!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.
The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the
words.

<p/>The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a
moment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of
a dream had passed across them.

<p/>Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from the worn chair, hinted at
prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name
of common sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not listen. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was free in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prison of
passion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prince, Prince Charming, was with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had called on
memory to remake him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soul to search for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>), and it
had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) back. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) kiss burned again upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
eyelids were warm with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) breath.

<p/>Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This
young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of.
Against the shell of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The
arrows of craft shot by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.

<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Mother, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) love me so much? I know why
I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is like what love himself should be.
But what does he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) see in me? I am not worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). And yet--why, I
cannot tell--though I feel so much beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), I don't feel humble. I
feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love
Prince Charming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
cheeks, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil rushed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>), flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) neck, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me,
Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it only
pains you because you loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so much. Don't look so sad. I am as
happy to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy for
ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides,
what do you know of this young man? You don't even know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name. The
whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away
to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you
should have shown more consideration. However, as I said before, if he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
is rich ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vane</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Vane glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>), and with one of those false theatrical
gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a
stage-player, clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) arms. At this moment, the door opened
and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was
thick-set of figure, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hands and feet were large and somewhat
clumsy in movement. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was not so finely bred as his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) sister. One
would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between
them. Mrs. Vane fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) and intensified her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
mentally elevated her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) son to the dignity of an audience. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) felt sure
that the _tableau_ was interesting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the
lad with a good-natured grumble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but you don't like being kissed, Jim,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You are a
dreadful old bear.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ran across the room and hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).

<p/>James Vane looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) sister's face with tenderness. <div class="bookquote">``I want you
to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don't suppose I shall ever
see this horrid London again. I am sure I don't want to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My son, don't say such dreadful things,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up
a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
felt a little disappointed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) had not joined the group. It would
have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, Mother? I mean it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a
position of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in
the Colonies--nothing that I would call society--so when you have made
your fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Society!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>muttered the lad. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to know anything about
that. I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the
stage. I hate it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jim!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl Vane/Sibyl</b></font>)</div>said Sibyl, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``how unkind of you! But are you
really going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you
were going to say good-bye to some of your friends--to Tom Hardy, who
gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for
smoking it. It is very sweet of you to let me have your last
afternoon. Where shall we go? Let us go to the park.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl Vane/Sibyl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am too shabby,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) answered, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``Only swell people go to the
park.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Jim,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) whispered, stroking the sleeve of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) coat.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hesitated for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``but don't be
too long dressing.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) danced out of the door. One could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
singing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) ran upstairs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) little feet pattered overhead.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) turned to
the still figure in the chair. <div class="bookquote">``Mother, are my things ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite ready, James,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) answered, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) work. For
some months past she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had felt ill at ease when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was alone with this
rough stern son of hers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) shallow secret nature was troubled when
their eyes met. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) used to wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) suspected anything. The
silence, for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) made no other observation, became intolerable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as
they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will be
contented, James, with your sea-faring life,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You must
remember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a
solicitor's office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in
the country often dine with the best families.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate offices, and I hate clerks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``But you are quite
right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl.
Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over Sibyl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to
talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). Is that right? What about that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are speaking about things you don't understand, James. In the
profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying
attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That
was when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at
present whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) attachment is serious or not. But there is no
doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is
always most polite to me. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has the appearance of being
rich, and the flowers he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sends are lovely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad harshly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother with a placid expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
has not yet revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) real name. I think it is quite romantic of
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is probably a member of the aristocracy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James Vane/James</b></font>)</div><p/>James Vane bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``Watch over Sibyl, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``watch
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special
care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) should not contract an alliance with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). I trust he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is one of the
aristocracy. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be
a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming
couple. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lad</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) coarse fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) had just turned round to say something
when the door opened and Sibyl ran in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How serious you both are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose one must be serious sometimes.
Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o'clock. Everything is
packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) answered with a bow of strained stateliness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was extremely annoyed at the tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) had adopted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), and
there was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) look that had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) feel afraid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kiss me, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) flowerlike lips touched the
withered cheek and warmed its frost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My child! my child!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in
search of an imaginary gallery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Sibyl,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) brother impatiently. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hated his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother's
affectations.

<p/>They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled
down the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in wonder at the
sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the
company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was like a common
gardener walking with a rose.

<p/>Jim frowned from time to time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) caught the inquisitive glance of
some stranger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on
geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl,
however, was quite unconscious of the effect she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was producing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
love was trembling in laughter on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was thinking of Prince
Charming, and, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) might think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) all the more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) did not
talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to
sail, about the gold he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was certain to find, about the wonderful
heiress whose life he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was to save from the wicked, red-shirted
bushrangers. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or
whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was going to be. Oh, no! A sailor's existence was
dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse,
hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind blowing the masts
down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands! He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was to
leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain,
and go off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was over he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was to
come across a large nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had
ever been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon
guarded by six mounted policemen. The bushrangers were to attack them
three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter. Or, no. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was
not to go to the gold-fields at all. They were horrid places, where
men got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad
language. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was
riding home, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a
robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>). Of course,
she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) would fall in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>), and they would get
married, and come home, and live in an immense house in London. Yes,
there were delightful things in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) must be very
good, and not lose his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) temper, or spend his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) money foolishly. She (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) was
only a year older than he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was, but she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) knew so much more of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
must be sure, also, to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) by every mail, and to say his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
prayers each night before he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) went to sleep. God was very good, and
would watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) would pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), too, and in a few years
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would come back quite rich and happy.

<p/>The lad listened sulkily to her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) and made no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was heart-sick
at leaving home.

<p/>Yet it was not this alone that made him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) gloomy and morose.
Inexperienced though he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had still a strong sense of the danger
of Sibyl's position. This young dandy who was making love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) could
mean her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) no good. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was a gentleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) for that, hated
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) through some curious race-instinct for which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could not account,
and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was
conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother's nature,
and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness.
Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge
them; sometimes they forgive them.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother! He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had something on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mind to ask of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), something that
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ears
one night as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of
horrible thoughts. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) remembered it as if it had been the lash of a
hunting-crop across his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) brows knit together into a wedge-like
furrow, and with a twitch of pain he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) underlip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl Vane/Sibyl</b></font>)</div>cried Sibyl, <div class="bookquote">``and I
am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl Vane/Sibyl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want me to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) answered,
smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``You are more likely to forget me than I am
to forget you, Sibyl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) flushed. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Jim?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? Why have you not told me
about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) means you no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Jim!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``You must not say anything against him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). I
love him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't even know his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>answered the lad. <div class="bookquote">``Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)? I
have a right to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) is called Prince Charming. Don't you like the name. Oh! you silly
boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), you would think
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--when you come back from Australia. You will like him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) so much.
Everybody likes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and I ... love him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). I wish you could come to the
theatre to-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet.
Oh! how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet!
To have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) sitting there! To play for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) delight! I am afraid I may
frighten the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in love is to
surpass one's self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting `genius'
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) loafers at the bar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) has preached me as a dogma; to-night he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>)
will announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>)
only, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am
poor beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>). Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in
at the door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want
rewriting. They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time
for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) is a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad sullenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A prince!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) cried musically. <div class="bookquote">``What more do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) wants to enslave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shudder at the thought of being free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to beware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) is to worship him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>); to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) is to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sibyl, you are mad about him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) laughed and took his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``You dear old Jim, you talk as if you
were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will
know what it is. Don't look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to
think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have
ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and
difficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new
world, and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and
see the smart people go by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>watchers</b></font>)</div><p/>They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds
across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white
dust--tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed--hung in the panting air.
The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous
butterflies.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) brother talk of himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hopes, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) prospects. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as
players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) could not
communicate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all
the echo she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) could win. After some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) became silent. Suddenly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open
carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) started to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim</b></font>)</div>said Jim Vane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prince Charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) answered, looking after the victoria.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) jumped up and seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) roughly by the arm. <div class="bookquote">``Show him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to me.
Which is he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)? Point him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) out. I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) exclaimed; but at
that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and when
it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)</div>murmured Sibyl sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ever does
you any wrong, I shall kill him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) in horror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) words. They cut the air
like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close
to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tittered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come away, Jim; come away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whispered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doggedly
as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed through the crowd. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) felt glad at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had said.

<p/>When they reached the Achilles Statue, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned round. There was
pity in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes that became laughter on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy,
that is all. How can you say such horrible things? You don't know
what you are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I
wish you would fall in love. Love makes people good, and what you said
was wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sixteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``and I know what I am about. Mother is no
help to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) doesn't understand how to look after you. I wish now
that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck
the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn't been signed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of those
silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am not
going to quarrel with you. I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and oh! to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) is
perfect happiness. We won't quarrel. I know you would never harm any
one I love, would you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as long as you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the sullen answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall love him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) for ever!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For ever, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shrank from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laughed and put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
was merely a boy.

<p/>At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to
their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o'clock, and
Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim
insisted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) should do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would sooner part with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) when their mother was not present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) would be sure to make a
scene, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) detested scenes of every kind.

<p/>In Sybil's own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad's
heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), had come between them. Yet, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) arms were flung round his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
neck, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) fingers strayed through his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) softened and kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sybil</b></font>) with real affection. There were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) went
downstairs.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mother was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) below. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grumbled at his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
unpunctuality, as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) made no answer, but sat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the
stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of
street-cabs, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that
was left to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).

<p/>After some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) thrust away his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) plate and put his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had a right to know. It should have been told
to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) before, if it was as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) suspected. Leaden with fear, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mother
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). Words dropped mechanically from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips. A tattered
lace handkerchief twitched in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fingers. When the clock struck six,
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) got up and went to the door. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) turned back and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
Their eyes met. In hers he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged
him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, I have something to ask you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes wandered
vaguely about the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made no answer. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me the truth. I
have a right to know. Were you married to my father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment,
the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had dreaded,
had come at last, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure
it was a disappointment to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). The vulgar directness of the question
called for a direct answer. The situation had not been gradually led
up to. It was crude. It reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of a bad rehearsal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father was a scoundrel then!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fists.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not free. We loved each other very
much. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have made provision for us. Don't
speak against him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), my son. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was your father, and a gentleman.
Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was highly connected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>An oath broke from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) exclaimed,
<div class="bookquote">``but don't let Sibyl... It is a gentleman, isn't it, who is in love
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), or says he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is? Highly connected, too, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
head drooped. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes with shaking hands. <div class="bookquote">``Sibyl has a
mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured; <div class="bookquote">``I had none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad was touched. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) went towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and stooping down, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``but I could not help it. I must go now. Good-bye. Don't forget
that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me
that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, track him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
down, and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like a dog. I swear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that
accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was familiar with the atmosphere. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breathed more
freely, and for the first time for many months she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) really admired her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
son. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have liked to have continued the scene on the same
emotional scale, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cut her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) short. Trunks had to be carried down
and mufflers looked for. The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out.
There was the bargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in
vulgar details. It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son
drove away. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was conscious that a great opportunity had been
wasted. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) consoled herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) felt
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) life would be, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had only one child to look after. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
remembered the phrase. It had pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). Of the threat she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) said
nothing. It was vividly and dramatically expressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) felt that
they would all laugh at it some day.



<p/>CHAPTER 6

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry that
evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol
where dinner had been laid for three.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div>answered the artist, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) hat and coat to the bowing
waiter. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They don't
interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons
worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little
whitewashing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>Hallward started and then frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian engaged to be married!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
cried. <div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is perfectly true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To some little actress or other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear
Basil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except in America,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>rejoined Lord Henry languidly. <div class="bookquote">``But I didn't say
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was married. I said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was engaged to be married. There is a great
difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have
no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I
never was engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But think of Dorian's birth, and position, and wealth. It would be
absurd for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to marry so much beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) marry this girl, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that, Basil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) is
sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it
is always from the noblest motives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don't want to see Dorian tied to
some vile creature, who might degrade his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) nature and ruin his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
intellect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is better than good--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry,
sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is
beautiful, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your
portrait of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) has quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) appreciation of the personal
appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst
others. We are to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to-night, if that boy doesn't forget his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
appointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you serious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should
ever be more serious than I am at the present moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you approve of it, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>asked the painter, walking up and
down the room and biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``You can't approve of it, possibly.
It is some silly infatuation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd
attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air
our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people
say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a
personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality
selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with
a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>). Why not?
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wedded Messalina, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) would be none the less interesting. You
know I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is
that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless.
They lack individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that
marriage makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it
many other egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They
become more highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should
fancy, the object of man's existence. Besides, every experience is of
value, and whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an
experience. I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wife,
passionately adore her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for six months, and then suddenly become
fascinated by some one else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) would be a wonderful study.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don't.
If Dorian Gray's life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than
yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry laughed. <div class="bookquote">``The reason we all like to think so well of others
is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is
sheer terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our
neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a
benefit to us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account,
and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) may spare
our pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest
contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but
one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have
merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly,
but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women.
I will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being
fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) will tell you more than I
can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the
lad, throwing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) evening cape with its satin-lined wings and
shaking each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) friends by the hand in turn. <div class="bookquote">``I have never been so
happy. Of course, it is sudden--all really delightful things are. And
yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my
life.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked
extraordinarily handsome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward, <div class="bookquote">``but I
don't quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.
You let Harry know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't forgive you for being late for dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>broke in Lord
Henry, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand on the lad's shoulder and smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and then
you will tell us how it all came about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is really not much to tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian as they took their
seats at the small round table. <div class="bookquote">``What happened was simply this. After
I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that
little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and
went down at eight o'clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind.
Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl!
You should have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)! When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) came on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) boy's clothes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
was perfectly wonderful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with
cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little
green cap with a hawk's feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak
lined with dull red. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had never seemed to me more exquisite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in
your studio, Basil. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) hair clustered round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) face like dark leaves
round a pale rose. As for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) acting--well, you shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
to-night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box
absolutely enthralled. I forgot that I was in London and in the
nineteenth century. I was away with my love in a forest that no man
had ever seen. After the performance was over, I went behind and spoke
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) eyes
a look that I had never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers.
We kissed each other. I can't describe to you what I felt at that
moment. It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one
perfect point of rose-coloured joy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) trembled all over and shook
like a white narcissus. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) flung herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) knees and kissed
my hands. I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can't help
it. Of course, our engagement is a dead secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) has not even told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) own mother. I don't know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley
is sure to be furious. I don't care. I shall be of age in less than a
year, and then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven't
I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare's
plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their
secret in my ear. I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and
kissed Juliet on the mouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Henry.

<p/>Dorian Gray shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) in the forest of Arden; I
shall find her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) in an orchard in Verona.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) champagne in a meditative manner. <div class="bookquote">``At what
particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did
not make any formal proposal. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) that I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>)
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole
world is nothing to me compared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women are wonderfully practical,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry, <div class="bookquote">``much more
practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to
say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``Don't, Harry. You have annoyed
Dorian. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is not like other men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) would never bring misery upon
any one. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) nature is too fine for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry looked across the table. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian is never annoyed with me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I asked the question for the best reason possible, for
the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any
question--simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the
women who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women. Except,
of course, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not
modern.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You are quite incorrigible,
Harry; but I don't mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When
you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>)
would be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any
one can wish to shame the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I want
to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the
woman who is mine. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. You mock at
it for that. Ah! don't mock. It is an irrevocable vow that I want to
take. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) trust makes me faithful, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) belief makes me good. When I
am with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), I regret all that you have taught me. I become different
from what you have known me to be. I am changed, and the mere touch of
Sibyl Vane's hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating,
poisonous, delightful theories.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And those are ...?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories
about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) slow melodious voice. <div class="bookquote">``But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory
as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature's
test, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) sign of approval. When we are happy, we are always good, but
when we are good, we are not always happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but what do you mean by good?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried Basil Hallward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>echoed Dorian, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) chair and looking at Lord
Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the
centre of the table, <div class="bookquote">``what do you mean by good, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be good is to be in harmony with one's self,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) replied, touching
the thin stem of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) glass with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pale, fine-pointed fingers.
<div class="bookquote">``Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own
life--that is the important thing. As for the lives of one's
neighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt
one's moral views about them, but they are not one's concern. Besides,
individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in
accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of
culture to accept the standard of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age is a form of the grossest
immorality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, surely, if one lives merely for one's self, Harry, one pays a
terrible price for doing so?''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>suggested the painter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy that
the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but
self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege
of the rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One has to pay in other ways but money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of ways, Basil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the
consciousness of degradation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, mediaeval art is
charming, but mediaeval emotions are out of date. One can use them in
fiction, of course. But then the only things that one can use in
fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me,
no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever
knows what a pleasure is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what pleasure is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray. <div class="bookquote">``It is to adore some

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is certainly better than being adored,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) answered, toying with
some fruits. <div class="bookquote">``Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to

have a right to demand it back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is quite true, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried Hallward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing is ever quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>interrupted Dorian. <div class="bookquote">``You must admit, Harry, that women give
to men the very gold of their lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sighed, <div class="bookquote">``but they invariably want it back in such very
small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once
put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always
prevent us from carrying them out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, you are dreadful! I don't know why I like you so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will always like me, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Will you have some
coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and
some cigarettes. No, don't mind the cigarettes--I have some. Basil, I
can't allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A
cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite,
and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian,
you will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you
have never had the courage to commit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense you talk, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad, taking a light from a
fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.
<div class="bookquote">``Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will
have a new ideal of life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) will represent something to you that you
have never known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
eyes, <div class="bookquote">``but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid, however,
that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your
wonderful girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real
than life. Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry,
Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow
us in a hansom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The
painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)
could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) to be better
than many other things that might have happened. After a few minutes,
they all passed downstairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) drove off by himself, as had been
arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in
front of him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>). A strange sense of loss came over him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) felt that
Dorian Gray would never again be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had been in the
past. Life had come between them... His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes darkened, and the
crowded flaring streets became blurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes. When the cab drew
up at the theatre, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had grown years older.



<p/>CHAPTER 7

<p/>For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat
Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with
an oily tremulous smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) escorted them to their box with a sort of
pompous humility, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) fat jewelled hands and talking at the top
of his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) voice. Dorian Gray loathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) more than ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord
Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
did, and insisted on shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) by the hand and assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone
bankrupt over a poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces
in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight
flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths
in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them
over the side. They talked to each other across the theatre and shared
their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women
were laughing in the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and
discordant. The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a place to find one's divinity in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>answered Dorian Gray. <div class="bookquote">``It was here I found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is
divine beyond all living things. When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) acts, you will forget
everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and
brutal gestures, become quite different when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is on the stage. They
sit silently and watch her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). They weep and laugh as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wills them to
do. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) makes them as responsive as a violin. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spiritualizes them,
and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same flesh and blood as one's self! Oh, I hope not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
opera-glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't pay any attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter. <div class="bookquote">``I
understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love
must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must
be fine and noble. To spiritualize one's age--that is something worth
doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without
one, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have
been sordid and ugly, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can strip them of their selfishness and
lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is worthy of
all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This
marriage is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it
now. The gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) you would have
been incomplete.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>answered Dorian Gray, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I knew that
you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) terrifies me. But
here is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for
about five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl
to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything
that is good in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl Vane/Sibyl</b></font>)</div><p/>A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of
applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was certainly
lovely to look at--one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) shy
grace and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a
mirror of silver, came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) glanced at the crowded
enthusiastic house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) stepped back a few paces and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) lips seemed
to tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) feet and began to applaud.
Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>).
Lord Henry peered through his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) glasses, murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``Charming! charming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) pilgrim's
dress had entered with Mercutio and his (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) other friends. The band, such
as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through
the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a
creature from a finer world. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) body swayed, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) danced, as a
plant sways in the water. The curves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) throat were the curves of
a white lily. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.

<p/>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was curiously listless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) showed no sign of joy when her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>)
eyes rested on Romeo. The few words she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) had to speak--

<p/>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss--

<p/>with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly
artificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view
of tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away
all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.

<p/>Dorian Gray grew pale as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was puzzled and anxious.
Neither of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) friends dared to say anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) seemed to
them to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.

<p/>Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of
the second act. They waited for that. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) failed there, there was
nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) looked charming as she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) came out in the moonlight. That could not
be denied. But the staginess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) acting was unbearable, and grew
worse as she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) went on. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) gestures became absurdly artificial. She (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>)
overemphasized everything that she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) had to say. The beautiful passage--

<p/>Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night--

<p/>was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been
taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>)
leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines--

<p/>Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say, <div class="bookquote">``It lightens.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Sweet, good-night!
This bud of love by summer's ripening breath
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet--

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>) spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>). It was
not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>) was absolutely
self-contained. It was simply bad art. She (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>) was a complete failure.

<p/>Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their
interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and
to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the
dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was
the girl herself.

<p/>When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord
Henry got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chair and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) coat. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is quite
beautiful, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can't act. Let us go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to see the play through,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>answered the lad, in a hard
bitter voice. <div class="bookquote">``I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an
evening, Harry. I apologize to you both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>interrupted
Hallward. <div class="bookquote">``We will come some other night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seems to me to be simply
callous and cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has entirely altered. Last night she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a
great artist. This evening she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is merely a commonplace mediocre
actress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more
wonderful thing than art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are both simply forms of imitation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>remarked Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``But
do let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not
good for one's morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don't suppose you
will want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) plays Juliet
like a wooden doll? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is very lovely, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knows as little
about life as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does about acting, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will be a delightful
experience. There are only two kinds of people who are really
fascinating--people who know absolutely everything, and people who know
absolutely nothing. Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look so tragic!
The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is
unbecoming. Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke
cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is beautiful.
What more can you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad. <div class="bookquote">``I want to be alone. Basil, you must
go. Ah! can't you see that my heart is breaking?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The hot tears came
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
leaned up against the wall, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
voice, and the two young men passed out together.

<p/>A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose
on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) looked pale,
and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed
interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots
and laughing. The whole thing was a _fiasco_. The last act was played
to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter and some
groans.

<p/>As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the
greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph
on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a
radiance about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parted lips were smiling over some secret of
their own.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), and an expression of infinite joy
came over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Horribly!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) answered, gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in amazement. <div class="bookquote">``Horribly! It
was dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no
idea what I suffered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, lingering over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) name with
long-drawn music in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to
the red petals of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian, you should have understood. But
you understand now, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Understand what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) asked, angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall
never act well again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill
you shouldn't act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were
bored. I was bored.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed not to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was transfigured with joy. An
ecstasy of happiness dominated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``before I knew you, acting was the one
reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I
thought that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the
other. The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia
were mine also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted
with me seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world.
I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came--oh, my
beautiful love!--and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what
reality really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw
through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in
which I had always played. To-night, for the first time, I became
conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the
moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and
that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not
what I wanted to say. You had brought me something higher, something
of which all art is but a reflection. You had made me understand what
love really is. My love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life!
I have grown sick of shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever
be. What have I to do with the puppets of a play? When I came on
to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone
from me. I thought that I was going to be wonderful. I found that I
could do nothing. Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant.
The knowledge was exquisite to me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled.
What could they know of love such as ours? Take me away, Dorian--take
me away with you, where we can be quite alone. I hate the stage. I
might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that
burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it
signifies? Even if I could do it, it would be profanation for me to
play at being in love. You have made me see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``You have
killed my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) muttered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) in wonder and laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) made no answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came
across to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), and with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little fingers stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knelt
down and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) drew them away, and a
shudder ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) leaped up and went to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you have
killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don't even
stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because
you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you
realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the
shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and
stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been!
You are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never
think of you. I will never mention your name. You don't know what you
were to me, once. Why, once ... Oh, I can't bear to think of it! I
wish I had never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of
my life. How little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art!
Without your art, you are nothing. I would have made you famous,
splendid, magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you
would have borne my name. What are you now? A third-rate actress with
a pretty face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl grew white, and trembled. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands together,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice seemed to catch in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``You are not serious,
Dorian?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``You are acting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) answered
bitterly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
face, came across the room to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) arm and
looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``Don't touch me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cried.

<p/>A low moan broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flung herself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) feet and lay
there like a trampled flower. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian, Dorian, don't leave me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry I didn't act well. I was thinking of you
all the time. But I will try--indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly
across me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if
you had not kissed me--if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again,
my love. Don't go away from me. I couldn't bear it. Oh! don't go
away from me. My brother ... No; never mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) didn't mean it. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was in jest... But you, oh! can't you forgive me for to-night? I will
work so hard and try to improve. Don't be cruel to me, because I love
you better than anything in the world. After all, it is only once that
I have not pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should
have shown myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I
couldn't help it. Oh, don't leave me, don't leave me.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>A fit of
passionate sobbing choked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crouched on the floor like a
wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) beautiful eyes, looked down at
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is
always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has
ceased to love. Sibyl Vane seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to be absurdly melodramatic.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) tears and sobs annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) said at last in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) calm clear voice. <div class="bookquote">``I don't wish
to be unkind, but I can't see you again. You have disappointed me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) little
hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) heel and left the room. In a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was out of
the theatre.

<p/>Where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) went to he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hardly knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) remembered wandering through dimly
lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking
houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves
like monstrous apes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had seen grotesque children huddled upon
door-steps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.

<p/>As the dawn was just breaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) found himself close to Covent Garden.
The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed
itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies
rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with
the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) an
anodyne for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) followed into the market and watched the men
unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) some
cherries. He (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>), wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) refused to accept any money
for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at
midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long
line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red
roses, defiled in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>), threading their way through the huge,
jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey,
sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,
waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging
doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped
and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.
Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked
and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.

<p/>After a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few
moments he (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent
square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.
The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like
silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke
was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.

<p/>In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge's barge, that
hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,
lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals
of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doge</b></font>) turned them out and,
having thrown his (<font color='blue'><b>Doge</b></font>) hat and cape on the table, passed through the library
towards the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doge</b></font>) bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the
ground floor that, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doge</b></font>) new-born feeling for luxury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doge</b></font>) had just had
decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries
that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Royal</b></font>) was turning the handle of the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Royal</b></font>) eye fell upon the portrait
Basil Hallward had painted of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) started back as if in surprise.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) went on into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
had taken the button-hole out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) seemed to hesitate.
Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In
the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk
blinds, the face appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) to be a little changed. The
expression looked different. One would have said that there was a
touch of cruelty in the mouth. It was certainly strange.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The
bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky
corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be
more intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) the
lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had been looking
into a mirror after he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had done some dreadful thing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory
Cupids, one of Lord Henry's many presents to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), glanced hurriedly
into its polished depths. No line like that warped his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) red lips. What
did it mean?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it
again. There were no signs of any change when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked into the
actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression
had altered. It was not a mere fancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own. The thing was
horribly apparent.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there
flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had said in Basil Hallward's studio the
day the picture had been finished. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remembered it perfectly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had uttered a mad wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) himself might remain young, and the
portrait grow old; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own beauty might be untarnished, and the
face on the canvas bear the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) passions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sins; that
the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and
thought, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) then just conscious boyhood. Surely his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wish had not been
fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to
think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), with the
touch of cruelty in the mouth.

<p/>Cruelty! Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) been cruel? It was the girl's fault, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had
dreamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as a great artist, had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) love to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) great. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had disappointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been
shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lying at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) feet sobbing like a little
child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remembered with what callousness he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had watched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Why
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)?
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the
play had lasted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of
torture. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life was well worth hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had marred him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for a
moment, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for an age. Besides, women were better
suited to bear sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They
only thought of their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely
to have some one with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that, and Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) trouble
about Sibyl Vane? She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) now.

<p/>But the picture? What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to say of that? It held the secret of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life, and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) story. It had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to love his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own
beauty. Would it teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to loathe his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own soul? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ever look
at it again?

<p/>No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The
horrible night that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had passed had left phantoms behind it.
Suddenly there had fallen upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brain that tiny scarlet speck that
makes men mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.

<p/>Yet it was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), with its beautiful marred face and its cruel
smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes
met his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the
painted image of himself, came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). It had altered already, and
would alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white
roses would die. For every sin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) committed, a stain would fleck
and wreck its fairness. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would not sin. The picture, changed or
unchanged, would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the visible emblem of conscience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would
resist temptation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would not see Lord Henry any more--would not, at
any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil
Hallward's garden had first stirred within him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) the passion for
impossible things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) amends,
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), try to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) again. Yes, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) duty to do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
must have suffered more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had. Poor child! He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had been selfish
and cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). The fascination that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had exercised over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
would return. They would be happy together. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) life with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) would
be beautiful and pure.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) chair and drew a large screen right in front of the
portrait, shuddering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) glanced at it. <div class="bookquote">``How horrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) murmured
to himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) walked across to the window and opened it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
stepped out on to the grass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) drew a deep breath. The fresh morning
air seemed to drive away all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) sombre passions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) thought only of
Sibyl. A faint echo of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) love came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
name over and over again. The birds that were singing in the
dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER 8

<p/>It was long past noon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) awoke. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) valet had crept several times
on tiptoe into the room to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was stirring, and had wondered
what made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) young master sleep so late. Finally his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) bell sounded,
and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on
a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin
curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the
three tall windows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur has well slept this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) said, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What o'clock is it, Victor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>asked Dorian Gray drowsily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>How late it was! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by
hand that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside.
The others he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection
of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes
of charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable
young men every morning during the season. There was a rather heavy
bill for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had not yet
had the courage to send on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) guardians, who were extremely
old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when
unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several
very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders
offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the
most reasonable rates of interest.

<p/>After about ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) got up, and throwing on an elaborate
dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the
onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) long
sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seemed to have forgotten all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had gone through. A
dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) once
or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was dressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) went into the library and sat down to a
light French breakfast that had been laid out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) on a small round
table close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air
seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in and buzzed round the
blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt perfectly happy.

<p/>Suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eye fell on the screen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had placed in front of the
portrait, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too cold for Monsieur?''  (<font color='red'><b>valet</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) valet, putting an omelette on the
table. <div class="bookquote">``I shut the window?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I am not cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been
simply his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own imagination that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) see a look of evil where
there had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter?
The thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day.
It would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) smile.

<p/>And, yet, how vivid was his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) recollection of the whole thing! First in
the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had seen the touch of
cruelty round the warped lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) almost dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) valet leaving the
room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) knew that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) would have to examine the
portrait. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes
had been brought and the man turned to go, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt a wild desire to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to remain. As the door was closing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
back. The man stood waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) orders. Dorian looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) for
a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I am not at home to any one, Victor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said with a sigh.
The man bowed and retired.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on
a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen
was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a
rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scanned it curiously,
wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man's life.

<p/>Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What
was the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it
was not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or
deadlier chance, eyes other than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spied behind and saw the horrible
change? What should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to
be examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful
state of doubt.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) got up and locked both doors. At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) would be alone when he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
looked upon the mask of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) shame. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) drew the screen aside and
saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had
altered.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost
scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was
incredible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle
affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form
and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)? Could it be
that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they
made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there,
gazing at the picture in sickened horror.

<p/>One thing, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) felt that it had done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). It had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
conscious how unjust, how cruel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not
too late to make reparation for that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) could still be his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) wife.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would
be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil
Hallward had painted of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would be a guide to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) through life, would
be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the
fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that
could lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of
the degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men
brought upon their souls.

<p/>Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double
chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was trying to gather up the
scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was
wandering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had
loved, imploring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of
pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we
feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,
not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the
letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had been forgiven.

<p/>Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heard Lord Henry's
voice outside. <div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I
can't bear your shutting yourself up like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking
still continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry
in, and to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the new life he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was going to lead, to quarrel
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was
inevitable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,
and unlocked the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) entered.
<div class="bookquote">``But you must not think too much about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>asked the lad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly
pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) yellow gloves. <div class="bookquote">``It is dreadful, from one point of
view, but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), after the play was over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was brutal, Harry--perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am
not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know
myself better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I
would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of
yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have got through all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head and
smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to
begin with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest
thing in us. Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more--at least not before
me. I want to be good. I can't bear the idea of my soul being

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By marrying Sibyl Vane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marrying Sibyl Vane!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
in perplexed amazement. <div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Dorian--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful
about marriage. Don't say it. Don't ever say things of that kind to
me again. Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to
break my word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is to be my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to you this

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I
was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't like. You

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know nothing then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray,
took both his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own and held them tightly. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``my letter--don't be frightened--was to tell you that Sibyl Vane
is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A cry of pain broke from the lad's lips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) leaped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) feet,
tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hands away from Lord Henry's grasp. <div class="bookquote">``Dead! Sibyl dead!
It is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite true, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``It is in all
the morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one
till I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must
not be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in
Paris. But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never
make one's _debut_ with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an
interest to one's old age. I suppose they don't know your name at the
theatre? If they don't, it is all right. Did any one see you going
round to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) room? That is an important point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was dazed with horror.
Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) stammered, in a stifled voice, <div class="bookquote">``Harry, did you say an
inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl--? Oh, Harry, I can't
bear it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put
in that way to the public. It seems that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was leaving the
theatre with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) mother, about half-past twelve or so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had
forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
did not come down again. They ultimately found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) lying dead on the
floor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) dressing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had swallowed something by mistake,
some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don't know what it was,
but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it
was prussic acid, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) seems to have died instantaneously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, Harry, it is terrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed
up in it. I see by _The Standard_ that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was seventeen. I should have
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was almost younger than that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) looked such a child, and
seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn't let this
thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and
afterwards we will look in at the opera. It is a Patti night, and
everybody will be there. You can come to my sister's box. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has got
some smart women with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian Gray, half to himself,
<div class="bookquote">``murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) as surely as if I had cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) little throat with a knife.
Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as
happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go
on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How
extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book,
Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has
happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.
Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my
life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been
addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent
people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) feel, or know, or listen?
Oh, Harry, how I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) once! It seems years ago to me now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
was everything to me. Then came that dreadful night--was it really
only last night?--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) played so badly, and my heart almost broke.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not
moved a bit. I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) shallow. Suddenly something happened that
made me afraid. I can't tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I
said I would go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). I felt I had done wrong. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is
dead. My God! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You don't know the
danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) would
have done that for me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had no right to kill herself. It was
selfish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) case
and producing a gold-latten matchbox, <div class="bookquote">``the only way a woman can ever
reform a man is by boring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so completely that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loses all possible
interest in life. If you had married this girl, you would have been
wretched. Of course, you would have treated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kindly. One can
always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would
have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). And
when a woman finds that out about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) either becomes
dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman's
husband has to pay for. I say nothing about the social mistake, which
would have been abject--which, of course, I would not have allowed--but
I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an
absolute failure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>muttered the lad, walking up and down the room
and looking horribly pale. <div class="bookquote">``But I thought it was my duty. It is not
my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was
right. I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good
resolutions--that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific
laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely _nil_.
They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions
that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said
for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they
have no account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I
don't think I am heartless. Do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be
entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sweet melancholy smile.

<p/>The lad frowned. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like that explanation, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rejoined,
<div class="bookquote">``but I am glad you don't think I am heartless. I am nothing of the
kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has
happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply
like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible
beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but
by which I have not been wounded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an interesting question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, who found an
exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism, <div class="bookquote">``an
extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is
this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such
an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their
absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack
of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us
an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.
Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of
beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the
whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly
we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the
play. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder
of the spectacle enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that
has really happened? Some one has killed herself for love of you. I
wish that I had ever had such an experience. It would have made me in
love with love for the rest of my life. The people who have adored
me--there have not been very many, but there have been some--have
always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them,
or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious, and when I
meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of
woman! What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual
stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the colour of life, but one
should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must sow poppies in my garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>sighed Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no necessity,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>rejoined his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``Life has always
poppies in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once
wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic
mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did
die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) proposing to
sacrifice the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment.
It fills one with the terror of eternity. Well--would you believe
it?--a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself seated at dinner
next the lady in question, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) insisted on going over the whole
thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had
buried my romance in a bed of asphodel. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dragged it out again and
assured me that I had spoiled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life. I am bound to state that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack
of taste she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past.
But women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a
sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over,
they propose to continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every
comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in
a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of
art. You are more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not
one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane
did for you. Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them
do it by going in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who
wears mauve, whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who
is fond of pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history.
Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good
qualities of their husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in
one's face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins. Religion
consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a
woman once told me, and I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing
makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes
egotists of us all. Yes; there is really no end to the consolations
that women find in modern life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most
important one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad listlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else's admirer when one
loses one's own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But
really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the
women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.
They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with,
such as romance, passion, and love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was terribly cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). You forget that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more
than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We
have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their
masters, all the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were
splendid. I have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can
fancy how delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to
me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely
fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key
to everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of
romance--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) died as Juliet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) came to life as Imogen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) will never come to life again now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>muttered the lad, burying his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
face in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) will never come to life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) has played her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) last part. But
you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply
as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful
scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really
lived, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has never really died. To you at least she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
always a dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare's plays and
left them lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare's
music sounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) touched
actual life, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marred it, and it marred her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) passed away.
Mourn for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because
Cordelia was strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of
Brabantio died. But don't waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was
less real than they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly,
and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The
colours faded wearily out of things.

<p/>After some time Dorian Gray looked up. <div class="bookquote">``You have explained me to
myself, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) murmured with something of a sigh of relief. <div class="bookquote">``I
felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I
could not express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will not
talk again of what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience.
That is all. I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as
marvellous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that
you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled? What
then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, rising to go, <div class="bookquote">``then, my dear Dorian, you
would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought to
you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads
too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We
cannot spare you. And now you had better dress and drive down to the
club. We are rather late, as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat
anything. What is the number of your sister's box?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
name on the door. But I am sorry you won't come and dine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel up to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian listlessly. <div class="bookquote">``But I am awfully
obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my
best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord
Henry, shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) by the hand. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye. I shall see you before
nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>), Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in
a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) waited impatiently for him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) to go. The man seemed to take an
interminable time over everything.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) rushed to the screen and drew it back. No;
there was no further change in the picture. It had received the news
of Sibyl Vane's death before he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had known of it himself. It was
conscious of the events of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty
that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the
very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or
was it indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what
passed within the soul? He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) wondered, and hoped that some day he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would
see the change taking place before his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) very eyes, shuddering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)
hoped it.

<p/>Poor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had often mimicked
death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) and taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>). How had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) played that dreadful last scene? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) cursed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) died? No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had died for love of him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>), and love would
always be a sacrament to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had atoned for everything by the
sacrifice she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would not think any more of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) go through, on that horrible night at the
theatre. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), it would be as a wonderful tragic
figure sent on to the world's stage to show the supreme reality of
love. A wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)
remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy
tremulous grace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) brushed them away hastily and looked again at the
picture.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) felt that the time had really come for making his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) choice. Or had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)--life, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth,
infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder
sins--he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the
burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) shame: that was all.

<p/>A feeling of pain crept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) thought of the desecration that
was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery
of Narcissus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips
that now smiled so cruelly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>). Morning after morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had sat
before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as
it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to
be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that
had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair?
The pity of it! the pity of it!

<p/>For a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that
existed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) and the picture might cease. It had changed in
answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain
unchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would
surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that
chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?
Besides, was it really under his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) control? Had it indeed been prayer
that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious
scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence
upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon
dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire,
might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods
and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?
But the reason was of no importance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would never again tempt by a
prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to
alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?

<p/>For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would be able to
follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)
the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) own body,
so it would reveal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) own soul. And when winter came upon it,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of
summer. When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid
mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would keep the glamour of boyhood.
Not one blossom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) life would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would be
strong, and fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the
coloured image on the canvas? He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would be safe. That was everything.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,
smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) did so, and passed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) bedroom, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) valet was
already waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>). An hour later he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) was at the opera, and Lord
Henry was leaning over his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chair.



<p/>CHAPTER 9

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown
into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) said gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I called
last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew
that was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really
gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy
might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for
me when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late
edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club. I came here at once
and was miserable at not finding you. I can't tell you how
heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer.
But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl's mother? For a
moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the
paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it? But I was afraid of
intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a
state she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be in! And her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only child, too! What did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say about
it all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Basil, how do I know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some
pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass
and looking dreadfully bored. <div class="bookquote">``I was at the opera. You should have
come on there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister, for the first
time. We were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) box. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) is perfectly charming; and Patti sang
divinely. Don't talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn't talk about
a thing, it has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry
says, that gives reality to things. I may mention that she (<font color='blue'><b>Patti</b></font>) was not the
woman's only child. There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is not on the stage. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is a sailor, or something. And now, tell
me about yourself and what you are painting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You went to the opera?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a
strained touch of pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``You went to the opera while
Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk to me
of other women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before
the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why,
man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Basil! I won't hear it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian, leaping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) feet.
<div class="bookquote">``You must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is
past is past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You call yesterday the past?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only
shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who
is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can invent a
pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to
use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You
look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come
down to my studio to sit for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) picture. But you were simple,
natural, and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature
in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You
talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harry's
influence. I see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lad</b></font>)</div><p/>The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few
moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. <div class="bookquote">``I owe a great
deal to Harry, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``more than I owe to you. You
only taught me to be vain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am punished for that, Dorian--or shall be some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) exclaimed, turning round. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't know what you want. What do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,''  (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div>said the artist sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad, going over to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``you have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl
Vane had killed herself--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried
Hallward, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) with an expression of horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Basil! Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident? Of
course she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) killed herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder man buried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``How fearful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
muttered, and a shudder ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian Gray, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing fearful about it. It is one
of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act
lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful
wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean--middle-class virtue
and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) lived her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
finest tragedy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was always a heroine. The last night she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)
played--the night you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) acted badly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had known
the reality of love. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) knew its unreality, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) died, as Juliet
might have died. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) passed again into the sphere of art. There is
something of the martyr about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) death has all the pathetic
uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying,
you must not think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday
at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to
six--you would have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who
brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I
suffered immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion.
No one can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil.
You come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find
me consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You
remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who
spent twenty years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life in trying to get some grievance
redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was.
Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) succeeded, and nothing could exceed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) disappointment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a
confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really
want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to
see it from a proper artistic point of view. Was it not Gautier who
used to write about _la consolation des arts_? I remember picking up a
little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that
delightful phrase. Well, I am not like that young man you told me of
when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say
that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. I
love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades,
green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings,
luxury, pomp--there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic
temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to
me. To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to
escape the suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking
to you like this. You have not realized how I have developed. I was a
schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new
thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I
am changed, but you must always be my friend. Of course, I am very
fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is. You are not
stronger--you are too much afraid of life--but you are better. And how
happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel
with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>),
and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) personality had been the great turning point in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) art. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
could not bear the idea of reproaching him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) any more. After all, his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. There
was so much in him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) that was good, so much in him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) that was noble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said at length, with a sad smile, <div class="bookquote">``I won't speak to
you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only trust your
name won't be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take
place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head, and a look of annoyance passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) face at
the mention of the word <div class="bookquote">``inquest.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>There was something so crude and
vulgar about everything of the kind. <div class="bookquote">``They don't know my name,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) never mentioned
to any one. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) told me once that they were all rather curious to
learn who I was, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) invariably told them my name was Prince
Charming. It was pretty of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>). You must do me a drawing of Sibyl,
Basil. I should like to have something more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) than the memory of
a few kisses and some broken pathetic words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you
must come and sit to me yourself again. I can't get on without you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) exclaimed,
starting back.

<p/>The painter stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, what nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) cried.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say you don't like what I did of you? Where is it?
Why have you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It
is the best thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian.
It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I
felt the room looked different as I came in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don't imagine I let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) arrange my room for me? He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) settles my flowers for me
sometimes--that is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong
on the portrait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for
it. Let me see it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>And Hallward walked towards the corner of the
room.

<p/>A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) rushed between
the painter and the screen. <div class="bookquote">``Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) said, looking very pale, <div class="bookquote">``you
must not look at it. I don't wish you to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn't I look
at it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Hallward, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never
speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don't
offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember,
if you touch this screen, everything is over between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward was thunderstruck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) looked at Dorian Gray in absolute
amazement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) like this before. The lad was
actually pallid with rage. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hands were clenched, and the pupils of
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) eyes were like disks of blue fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was trembling all over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is the matter? Of course I won't look at it if you don't
want me to,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, rather coldly, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) heel and going over
towards the window. <div class="bookquote">``But, really, it seems rather absurd that I
shouldn't see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in
Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of
varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dorian Gray, a
strange sense of terror creeping over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Was the world going to be
shown his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) life?
That was impossible. Something--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) did not know what--had to be done
at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I don't suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going
to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de
Seze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will
only be away a month. I should think you could easily spare it for
that time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you keep
it always behind a screen, you can't care much about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) forehead. There were beads of
perspiration there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was on the brink of a horrible
danger. <div class="bookquote">``You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
cried. <div class="bookquote">``Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for
being consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only
difference is that your moods are rather meaningless. You can't have
forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world
would induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry exactly
the same thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) remembered that Lord Henry had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) once, half
seriously and half in jest, <div class="bookquote">``If you want to have a strange quarter of
an hour, get Basil to tell you why he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) won't exhibit your picture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
told me why he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) wouldn't, and it was a revelation to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Yes, perhaps
Basil, too, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) secret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) and try.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) said, coming over quite close and looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) straight in
the face, <div class="bookquote">``we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall
tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my
picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The painter shuddered in spite of himself. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian, if I told you, you
might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I
could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me
never to look at your picture again, I am content. I have always you
to look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden
from the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than
any fame or reputation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Basil, you must tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>insisted Dorian Gray. <div class="bookquote">``I think I have a
right to know.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity
had taken its place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was determined to find out Basil Hallward's
mystery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us sit down, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter, looking troubled. <div class="bookquote">``Let us
sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the
picture something curious?--something that probably at first did not
strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Basil!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad, clutching the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) chair with trembling
hands and gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) with wild startled eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you did. Don't speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.
Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most
extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and
power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen
ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I
worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I
wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with
you. When you were away from me, you were still present in my art...
Of course, I never let you know anything about this. It would have
been impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly
understood it myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to
face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes--too
wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril
of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them... Weeks and
weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you. Then came a
new development. I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as
Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with
heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, gazing
across the green turbid Nile. You had leaned over the still pool of
some Greek woodland and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel of
your own face. And it had all been what art should be--unconscious,
ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I
determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are,
not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own
time. Whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of
your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or
veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at it, every flake
and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I grew afraid
that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that I had told
too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it was that
I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You were a
little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me.
Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not mind
that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt
that I was right... Well, after a few days the thing left my studio,
and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its
presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I
had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking
and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a
mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really
shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract than we
fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour--that is all. It
often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than
it ever reveals him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>). And so when I got this offer from Paris, I
determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.
It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were
right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me,
Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are
made to be worshipped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cheeks,
and a smile played about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lips. The peril was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was safe
for the time. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) could not help feeling infinite pity for the
painter who had just made this strange confession to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), and wondered
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a
friend. Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that
was all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of.
Would there ever be some one who would fill him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with a strange
idolatry? Was that one of the things that life had in store?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward, <div class="bookquote">``that you should
have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw something in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``something that seemed to me very
curious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you don't mind my looking at the thing now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not
possibly let you stand in front of that picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will some day, surely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have been
the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I
have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don't know what it cost
me to tell you all that I have told you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, <div class="bookquote">``what have you told me? Simply that you
felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a compliment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I
have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one
should never put one's worship into words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a very disappointing confession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn't see anything else in the
picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn't
talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and
we must always remain so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have got Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. <div class="bookquote">``Harry spends
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) days in saying what is incredible and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) evenings in doing what is
improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I
don't think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner
go to you, Basil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will sit to me again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes
across two ideal things. Few come across one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.
There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own.
I will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>murmured Hallward regretfully. <div class="bookquote">``And
now good-bye. I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once
again. But that can't be helped. I quite understand what you feel
about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! How
little he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that,
instead of having been forced to reveal his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) own secret, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had
succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) friend! How
much that strange confession explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)! The painter's absurd
fits of jealousy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) wild devotion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) extravagant panegyrics, his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
curious reticences--he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) understood them all now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) felt sorry.
There seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured
by romance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at
all costs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had
been mad of him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour,
in a room to which any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) friends had access.



<p/>CHAPTER 10

<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) servant entered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) steadfastly and wondered if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite
impassive and waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked
over to the glass and glanced into it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) could see the reflection of
Victor's face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility.
There was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) thought it best to be
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) guard.

<p/>Speaking very slowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to tell the house-keeper that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to
send two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) men round at once. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that as the man
left the room his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. Or was
that merely his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own fancy?

<p/>After a few moments, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread
mittens on her (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>) for the key of the schoolroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Why, it is full of
dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it.
It is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, you'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why, it
hasn't been opened for nearly five years--not since his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) lordship died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) winced at the mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandfather. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hateful memories
of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That does not matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I simply want to see
the place--that is all. Give me the key.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And here is the key, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, going over the contents
of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. <div class="bookquote">``Here is the key. I'll
have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don't think of living up
there, sir, and you so comfortable here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried petulantly. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Leaf. That will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of
the household. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sighed and told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to manage things as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought
best. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left the room, wreathed in smiles.

<p/>As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) pocket and looked round
the room. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily
embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century
Venetian work that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.
Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps
served often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that
had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death
itself--something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.
What the worm was to the corpse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) sins would be to the painted image
on the canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They
would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still
live on. It would be always alive.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shuddered, and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had not told Basil
the true reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had wished to hide the picture away. Basil
would have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) to resist Lord Henry's influence, and the still
more poisonous influences that came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) own temperament. The love
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)--for it was really love--had nothing in it that was
not noble and intellectual. It was not that mere physical admiration
of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses
tire. It was such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and
Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>).
But it was too late now. The past could always be annihilated.
Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that. But the future was
inevitable. There were passions in him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) that would find their terrible
outlet, dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that
covered it, and, holding it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) hands, passed behind the screen.
Was the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) that it
was unchanged, and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) loathing of it was intensified. Gold hair,
blue eyes, and rose-red lips--they all were there. It was simply the
expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty.
Compared to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil's
reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!--how shallow, and of what little
account! His (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) own soul was looking out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) from the canvas and
calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) to judgement. A look of pain came across him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) flung
the rich pall over the picture. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) did so, a knock came to the
door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) passed out as his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) servant entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The persons are here, Monsieur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) must not be
allowed to know where the picture was being taken to. There was
something sly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.
Sitting down at the writing-table he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) scribbled a note to Lord Henry,
asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) round something to read and reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that
they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait for an answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, handing it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and show the men in
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard
himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in
with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a
florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was
considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the
artists who dealt with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>). As a rule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) never left his (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>)
waited for people to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) always made an exception in
favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed
everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) fat freckled
hands. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in
person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a
sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably
suited for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.
Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame--though I
don't go in much at present for religious art--but to-day I only want a
picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so
I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to
you. Which is the work of art, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>replied Dorian, moving the screen back. <div class="bookquote">``Can you move it,
covering and all, just as it is? I don't want it to get scratched
going upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be no difficulty, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the frame-maker</b></font>)</div>said the genial frame-maker,
beginning, with the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) assistant, to unhook the picture from
the long brass chains by which it was suspended. <div class="bookquote">``And, now, where
shall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me.
Or perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the
top of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is
wider.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and
began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the
picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious
protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman's spirited dislike
of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand to it
so as to help them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something of a load to carry, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>gasped the little man when they
reached the top landing. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shiny forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it is rather heavy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>murmured Dorian as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) unlocked the
door that opened into the room that was to keep for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) the curious
secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) life and hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) soul from the eyes of men.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had not entered the place for more than four years--not, indeed,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had used it first as a play-room when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was a child, and then
as a study when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) grew somewhat older. It was a large,
well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord
Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) strange likeness
to his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) mother, and also for other reasons, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) had always hated and
desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to have but
little changed. There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its
fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had so often hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book-case
filled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) dog-eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was
hanging the same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen
were playing chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by,
carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
remembered it all! Every moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lonely childhood came back to
him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) looked round. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) recalled the stainless purity of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) boyish
life, and it seemed horrible to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) that it was here the fatal portrait
was to be hidden away. How little he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had thought, in those dead days,
of all that was in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)!

<p/>But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as
this. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its
purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,
and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) himself
would not see it. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) watch the hideous corruption of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
soul? He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) youth--that was enough. And, besides, might not
his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) nature grow finer, after all? There was no reason that the future
should be so full of shame. Some love might come across his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life, and
purify him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and shield him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) from those sins that seemed to be already
stirring in spirit and in flesh--those curious unpictured sins whose
very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some
day, the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive
mouth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might show to the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.

<p/>No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing
upon the canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of
sin, but the hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would
become hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow's feet would creep round the
fading eyes and make them horrible. The hair would lose its
brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross,
as the mouths of old men are. There would be the wrinkled throat, the
cold, blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) remembered in the
grandfather who had been so stern to him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) boyhood. The picture
had to be concealed. There was no help for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) said, wearily, turning round.
<div class="bookquote">``I am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,''  (<font color='red'><b>the frame-maker</b></font>)</div>answered the frame-maker, who
was still gasping for breath. <div class="bookquote">``Where shall we put it, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don't want to have it hung up.
Just lean it against the wall. Thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Might one look at the work of art, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian started. <div class="bookquote">``It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said,
keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) eye on the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt ready to leap upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) and fling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to the ground if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that
concealed the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't trouble you any more now.
I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you,
sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hubbard</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,
who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) rough
uncomely face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had never seen any one so marvellous.

<p/>When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door
and put the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt safe now. No one would ever
look upon the horrible thing. No eye but his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) would ever see his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shame.

<p/>On reaching the library, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) found that it was just after five o'clock
and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of
dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady
Radley, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) guardian's wife, a pretty professional invalid who had
spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry,
and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn
and the edges soiled. A copy of the third edition of _The St. James's
Gazette_ had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had
returned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had met the men in the hall as they were
leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would be sure to miss the picture--had no doubt missed it already,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set
back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)
might find him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the
room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) had
heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some
servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked
up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower
or a shred of crumpled lace.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry's
note. It was simply to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) round the evening paper,
and a book that might interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would be at the club at
eight-fifteen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opened _The St. James's_ languidly, and looked through
it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eye. It drew
attention to the following paragraph:


<p/>INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.--An inquest was held this morning at the Bell
Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of
Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,
Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned.
Considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who
was greatly affected during the giving of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own evidence, and that of
Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and
flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real
ugliness made things! He (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for
having sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the report. And it was certainly stupid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to have
marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew
more than enough English for that.

<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet,
what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's
death? There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). What was
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wondered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal
stand that had always looked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) like the work of some strange
Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung
himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves. After a
few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) became absorbed. It was the strangest book that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had
ever read. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that in exquisite raiment, and to the
delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb
show before him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had dimly dreamed of were suddenly
made real to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Things of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had never dreamed were gradually
revealed.

<p/>It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,
indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who
spent his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the
passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through
which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere
artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,
as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The
style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid
and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical
expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work
of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.
There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in
colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical
philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the
spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions
of a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of
incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The
mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so
full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,
produced in the mind of the lad, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) passed from chapter to chapter,
a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) unconscious of
the falling day and creeping shadows.

<p/>Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed
through the windows. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) read on by its wan light till he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could read no
more. Then, after his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) valet had reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) several times of the
lateness of the hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) got up, and going into the next room, placed
the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
bedside and began to dress for dinner.

<p/>It was almost nine o'clock before he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) reached the club, where he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) found
Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``but really it is entirely your
fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the
time was going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I thought you would like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) host, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a
great difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have discovered that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry. And they passed
into the dining-room.



<p/>CHAPTER 11

<p/>For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of
this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) never
sought to free himself from it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) procured from Paris no less than
nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in
different colours, so that they might suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) various moods and the
changing fancies of a nature over which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) seemed, at times, to have
almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian
in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely
blended, became to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And,
indeed, the whole book seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) to contain the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) own
life, written before he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had lived it.

<p/>In one point he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
never knew--never, indeed, had any cause to know--that somewhat
grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still
water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) life, and was
occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently,
been so remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy--and perhaps in
nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its
place--that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) used to read the latter part of the book, with its
really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and
despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
had most dearly valued.

<p/>For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and
many others besides him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), seemed never to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). Even those who had
heard the most evil things against him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)--and from time to time strange
rumours about his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) mode of life crept through London and became the
chatter of the clubs--could not believe anything to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) dishonour when
they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had always the look of one who had kept himself
unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when
Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
face that rebuked them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) mere presence seemed to recall to them the
memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one
so charming and graceful as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was could have escaped the stain of an
age that was at once sordid and sensual.

<p/>Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged
absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) friends, or thought that they were so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) himself would creep
upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil
Hallward had painted of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), looking now at the evil and aging face on
the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to
quicken his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) sense of pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) grew more and more enamoured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own soul.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and
terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead
or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which
were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would
place his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,
and smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.

<p/>There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own
delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little
ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in
disguise, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) habit to frequent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would think of the ruin he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
had brought upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) soul with a pity that was all the more poignant
because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare.
That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), as
they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase
with gratification. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) desired to know. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fed them.

<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not really reckless, at any rate in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) relations to
society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each
Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would throw open to the
world his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the
day to charm his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) guests with the wonders of their art. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) little
dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), were
noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,
as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with
its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered
cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many,
especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,
in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often
dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of
the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and
perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) seemed to be of
the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to <div class="bookquote">``make
themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dante</b></font>)</div>Like Gautier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) was one
for whom <div class="bookquote">``the visible world existed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And, certainly, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) life itself was the first, the greatest, of the
arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.
Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment
universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert
the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of
the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) in
everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) graceful, though to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) only half-serious, fopperies.

<p/>For, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) was but too ready to accept the position that was almost
immediately offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) coming of age, and found, indeed, a
subtle pleasure in the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) might really become to the
London of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the
Satyricon once had been, yet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) inmost heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) desired to be
something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on the
wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a
cane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have
its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the
spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.

<p/>The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been
decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and
sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are
conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.
But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had
never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal
merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or
to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a
new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the
dominant characteristic. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) looked back upon man moving through
history, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been
surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful
rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose
origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more
terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,
they had sought to escape; Nature, in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wonderful irony, driving out
the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to
the hermit the beasts of the field as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) companions.

<p/>Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism
that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely
puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was
to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to
accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any
mode of passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience
itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might
be. Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar
profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to
teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is
itself but a moment.

<p/>There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either
after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of
death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through
the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality
itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques,
and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one
might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled
with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the
curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb
shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside,
there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men
going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down
from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it
feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from
her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by
degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we
watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan
mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we
had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been
studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the
letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.
Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night
comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where
we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the
necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of
stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids
might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in
the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh
shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in
which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate,
in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of
joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.

<p/>It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray
to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and
possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
would often adopt certain modes of thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) knew to be really
alien to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and
then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that
is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that,
indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition
of it.

<p/>It was rumoured of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was about to join the Roman
Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great
attraction for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>). The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all
the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) as much by its superb
rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity
of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it
sought to symbolize. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) loved to kneel down on the cold marble
pavement and watch the priest, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly
and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or
raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid
wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the <div class="bookquote">''_panis
caelestis_,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the
Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
breast for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) sins. The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their
lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their
subtle fascination for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) passed out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) used to look with
wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of
one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn
grating the true story of their lives.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) never fell into the error of arresting his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) intellectual
development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of
mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable
for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which
there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its
marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle
antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) for a
season; and for a season he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) inclined to the materialistic doctrines of
the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in
tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the
brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of
the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,
morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
before, no theory of life seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) to be of any importance
compared with life itself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) felt keenly conscious of how barren all
intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual
mysteries to reveal.

<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would now study perfumes and the secrets of their
manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums
from the East. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not
its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their
true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one
mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one's passions, and in violets
that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the
brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often
to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several
influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers;
of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that
sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to
be able to expel melancholy from the soul.

<p/>At another time he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long
latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of
olive-green lacquer, he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) used to give curious concerts in which mad
gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled
Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while
grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching
upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of
reed or brass and charmed--or feigned to charm--great hooded snakes and
horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of
barbaric music stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's
beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell
unheeded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) ear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) collected together from all parts of the world
the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of
dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact
with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) had
the mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not
allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been
subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the
Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human
bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green
jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular
sweetness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfonso</b></font>) had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when
they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the
performer does not blow, but through which he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) inhales the air; the
harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who
sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a
distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating
tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an
elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells of
the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge
cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the
one that Bernal Diaz saw when he (<font color='blue'><b>Diaz</b></font>) went with Cortes into the Mexican
temple, and of whose doleful sound he (<font color='blue'><b>Diaz</b></font>) has left us so vivid a
description. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like
Nature, has her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous
voices. Yet, after some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wearied of them, and would sit in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt
pleasure to <div class="bookquote">``Tannhauser''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>and seeing in the prelude to that great work
of art a presentation of the tragedy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own soul.

<p/>On one occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a
costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered
with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) for
years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) would often
spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various
stones that he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that
turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver,
the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes,
carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red
cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their
alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) loved the red gold of the
sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow
of the milky opal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of
extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la
vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonso's
Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real
jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of
Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes <div class="bookquote">``with
collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Conqueror</b></font>)</div>There was a gem in
the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and <div class="bookquote">``by the exhibition
of golden letters and a scarlet robe''  (<font color='red'><b>Philostratus</b></font>)</div>the monster could be thrown into
a magical sleep and slain. According to the great alchemist, Pierre de
Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth
provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The
garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Boniface</b></font>)
colour. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus,
that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.
Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a
newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The
bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm
that could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was the
aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any
danger by fire.

<p/>The King of Ceilan rode through his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) city with a large ruby in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand,
as the ceremony of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) coronation. The gates of the palace of John the
Priest were <div class="bookquote">``made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake
inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Priest</b></font>)</div>Over the gable
were <div class="bookquote">``two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>so that the
gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night. In Lodge's
strange romance ``A Margarite of America', it was stated that in the
chamber of the queen one could behold <div class="bookquote">``all the chaste ladies of the
world, inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of
chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Marco Polo
had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the
mouths of the dead. A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that
the diver brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned
for seven moons over its loss. When the Huns lured the king into the
great pit, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) flung it away--Procopius tells the story--nor was it ever
found again, though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight
of gold pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a certain
Venetian a rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god
that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) worshipped.

<p/>When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI, visited Louis XII of
France, his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to Brantome,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great light.
Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred and
twenty-one diamonds. Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty thousand
marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall described Henry VIII,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) way to the Tower previous to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) coronation, as wearing <div class="bookquote">``a
jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds and other
rich stones, and a great bauderike about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck of large balasses.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold
filigrane. Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour
studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with
turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parseme_ with pearls. Henry II wore
jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with
twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles
the Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) race, was hung with
pear-shaped pearls and studded with sapphires.

<p/>How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and
decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that
performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern
nations of Europe. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) investigated the subject--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) always had
an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment
in whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took up--he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was almost saddened by the reflection of the
ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), at any
rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow
jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the
story of their shame, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was unchanged. No winter marred his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face
or stained his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material
things! Where had they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured
robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked
by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium
that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail
of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a
chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds? He (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) longed to see the
curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were
displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;
the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden
bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of
Pontus and were figured with <div class="bookquote">``lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,
rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature'' (<font color='red'><b>the Bishop</b></font>)</div>; and
the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which
were embroidered the verses of a song beginning <div class="bookquote">''_Madame, je suis tout
joyeux_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold
thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four
pearls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims
for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with <div class="bookquote">``thirteen
hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the
king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings
were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked
in gold.''  (<font color='red'><b>Queen Joan</b></font>)</div>Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) of
black velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of
damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver
ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it
stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's devices in cut black
velvet upon cloth of silver. Louis XIV had gold embroidered caryatides
fifteen feet high in his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of
Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with
verses from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully
chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It
had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of
Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.

<p/>And so, for a whole year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mohammed</b></font>) sought to accumulate the most exquisite
specimens that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mohammed</b></font>) could find of textile and embroidered work, getting
the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and
stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings; the Dacca gauzes, that
from their transparency are known in the East as <div class="bookquote">``woven air,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
<div class="bookquote">``running water,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``evening dew'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; strange figured cloths from Java;
elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair
blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of
_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish
velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,
with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed
he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had for everything connected with the service of the Church. In the
long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) house, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had
stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the
raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and
fine linen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by
the suffering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,
figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in
six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the
pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided
into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the
coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.
This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of
green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,
from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which
were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse
bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were
woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with
medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold
brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with
representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and
embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of
white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins
and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and
many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices to
which such things were put, there was something that quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
imagination.

<p/>For these treasures, and everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) collected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) lovely
house, were to be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) means of forgetfulness, modes by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) at times
to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely
locked room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had spent so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) boyhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had hung with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
the real degradation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) life, and in front of it had draped the
purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would not go there,
would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) light heart,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) wonderful joyousness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) passionate absorption in mere existence.
Then, suddenly, some night he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would creep out of the house, go down to
dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was driven away. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) return he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would sit in front of the
picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other
times, with that pride of individualism that is half the
fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen
shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own.

<p/>After a few years he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) could not endure to be long out of England, and
gave up the villa that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as
well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more
than once spent the winter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hated to be separated from the picture
that was such a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life, and was also afraid that during his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the
elaborate bars that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had caused to be placed upon the door.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true
that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness
of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn
from that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had
not painted it. What was it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) how vile and full of shame it
looked? Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) told them, would they believe it?

<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was afraid. Sometimes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) great house in
Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own rank
who were his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton
luxury and gorgeous splendour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mode of life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would suddenly
leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not
been tampered with and that the picture was still there. What if it
should be stolen? The mere thought made him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cold with horror. Surely
the world would know his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) secret then. Perhaps the world already
suspected it.

<p/>For, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) birth
and social position fully entitled him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to become a member, and it was
said that on one occasion, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was brought by a friend into the
smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another
gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories
became current about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had passed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) twenty-fifth year. It
was rumoured that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a
low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) consorted with
thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) used to reappear
again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with a sneer, or look at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with cold searching eyes, as though
they were determined to discover his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) secret.

<p/>Of such insolences and attempted slights he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), of course, took no notice,
and in the opinion of most people his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) frank debonair manner, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth
that seemed never to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), were in themselves a sufficient answer
to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most
intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appeared, after a time, to shun him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Women who had
wildly adored him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sake had braved all social censure and
set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or
horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.

<p/>Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
strange and dangerous charm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) great wealth was a certain element of
security. Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready to
believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and
fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more
importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability
is of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_. And, after
all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has
given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private
life. Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrees_, as
Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is
possibly a good deal to be said for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) view. For the canons of good
society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is
absolutely essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony,
as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of
a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful
to us. Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is
merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.

<p/>Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) used to wonder at the
shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing
simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), man was a
being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform
creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and
passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies
of the dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country house and look at the various portraits of those whose
blood flowed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by
Francis Osborne, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and
King James, as one who was <div class="bookquote">``caressed by the Court for his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) handsome
face, which kept him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) not long company.''  (<font color='red'><b>King James</b></font>)</div>Was it young Herbert's life
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body
to body till it had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own? Was it some dim sense of that
ruined grace that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) so suddenly, and almost without cause,
give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had
so changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled
surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) silver-and-black armour piled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) feet. What had this
man's legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
some inheritance of sin and shame? Were his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own actions merely the
dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the
fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) gauze hood, pearl
stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) right hand,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On
a table by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large
green rosettes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) little pointed shoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) life, and
the strange stories that were told about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lovers. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) something
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) temperament in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to
look curiously at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What of George Willoughby, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) powdered
hair and fantastic patches? How evil he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) looked! The face was
saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with
disdain. Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that
were so overladen with rings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had been a macaroni of the eighteenth
century, and the friend, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the
second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>)
wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs.
Fitzherbert? How proud and handsome he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) was, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) chestnut curls
and insolent pose! What passions had he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) bequeathed? The world had
looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) as infamous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) had led the orgies at Carlton House.
The star of the Garter glittered upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) breast. Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) hung the
portrait of his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blood,
also, stirred within him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>). How curious it all seemed! And his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) mother
with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Lady Hamilton face and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) moist, wine-dashed lips--he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) knew
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) had got from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) had got from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) beauty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>)
passion for the beauty of others. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loose
Bacchante dress. There were vine leaves in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hair. The purple
spilled from the cup she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was holding. The carnations of the painting
had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and
brilliancy of colour. They seemed to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) went.

<p/>Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one's own race,
nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly
with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There
were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history
was merely the record of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own life, not as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had lived it in act
and circumstance, but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) imagination had created it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), as it
had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) brain and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) passions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had known
them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the
stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of
subtlety. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that in some mysterious way their lives had
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own.

<p/>The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) life had
himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) tells how,
crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had sat, as
Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of
Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) and the
flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had
caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in
an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had
wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round
with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>)
days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _taedium vitae_, that comes
on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear
emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of
pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the
Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero
Caesar as he (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) face with
colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon
from Carthage and given her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) in mystic marriage to the Sun.

<p/>Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the
two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious
tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and
beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made
monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his (<font color='blue'><b>Filippo</b></font>) wife and
painted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips with a scarlet poison that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover might suck death
from the dead thing he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as
Paul the Second, who sought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) vanity to assume the title of
Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was
bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used
hounds to chase living men and whose murdered body was covered with
roses by a harlot who had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Visconti</b></font>); the Borgia on his (<font color='blue'><b>Visconti</b></font>) white horse,
with Fratricide riding beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Visconti</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Visconti</b></font>) mantle stained with the blood
of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence,
child and minion of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was equalled only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>)
debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white
and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy
that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose
melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a
passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine--the son of the
Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his (<font color='blue'><b>Fiend</b></font>) father at dice when
gambling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fiend</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fiend</b></font>) own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery
took the name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of
three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the
lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome
as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and
gave poison to Ginevra d``Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a
shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles
VI, who had so wildly adored his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brother's wife that a leper had warned
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) of the insanity that was coming on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and who, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brain had
sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards
painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto
Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bride, and Simonetto with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) page,
and whose comeliness was such that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lay dying in the yellow
piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not choose but weep,
and Atalanta, who had cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>There was a horrible fascination in them all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw them at night,
and they troubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of
strange manners of poisoning--poisoning by a helmet and a lighted
torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander
and by an amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book. There
were moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) looked on evil simply as a mode through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
could realize his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) conception of the beautiful.



<p/>CHAPTER 12

<p/>It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own thirty-eighth
birthday, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) often remembered afterwards.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was walking home about eleven o'clock from Lord Henry's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold
and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street,
a man passed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grey ulster turned up. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a bag in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. Dorian
recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) could not account, came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) made no sign of
recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own house.

<p/>But Hallward had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). Dorian heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) first stopping on the
pavement and then hurrying after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). In a few moments, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand was
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for
you in your library ever since nine o'clock. Finally I took pity on
your tired servant and told him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to go to bed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) let me out. I am
off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see
you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as
you passed me. But I wasn't quite sure. Didn't you recognize me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can't even recognize Grosvenor
Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don't feel
at all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not
seen you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take
a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great
picture I have in my head. However, it wasn't about myself I wanted to

something to say to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be charmed. But won't you miss your train?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian Gray
languidly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) passed up the steps and opened the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
latch-key.

<p/>The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
watch. <div class="bookquote">``I have heaps of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``The train doesn't go
till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my
way to the club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shan't
have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I
have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty
minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``What a way for a fashionable painter
to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will
get into the house. And mind you don't talk about anything serious.
Nothing is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) head, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) entered, and followed Dorian into the
library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open
hearth. The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case
stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on
a little marqueterie table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) gave me
everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is
a most hospitable creature. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) much better than the Frenchman
you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) married Lady Radley's
maid, and has established her (<font color='blue'><b>Radley</b></font>) in Paris as an English dressmaker.
Anglomania is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly
of the French, doesn't it? But--do you know?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) was not at all a bad
servant. I never liked him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), but I had nothing to complain about. One
often imagines things that are quite absurd. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was really very
devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went away. Have another
brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take
hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the next room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, I won't have anything more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cap

corner. <div class="bookquote">``And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.
Don't frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it all about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) petulant way, flinging
himself down on the sofa. <div class="bookquote">``I hope it is not about myself. I am tired
of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is about yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>answered Hallward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) grave deep voice, <div class="bookquote">``and
I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``Half an hour!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own
sake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know that
the most dreadful things are being said against you in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other
people, but scandals about myself don't interest me. They have not got
the charm of novelty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
good name. You don't want people to talk of you as something vile and
degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all
that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind
you, I don't believe these rumours at all. At least, I can't believe
them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's
face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices.
There are no such things. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows
itself in the lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth, the droop of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyelids, the
moulding of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands even. Somebody--I won't mention his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name, but
you know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--came to me last year to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) portrait done. I had
never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before, and had never heard anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the
time, though I have heard a good deal since. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offered an extravagant
price. I refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There was something in the shape of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers
that I hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied
about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure,
bright, innocent face, and your marvellous untroubled youth--I can't
believe anything against you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you
never come down to the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I
hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you, I
don't know what to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of
Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so
many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you to
theirs? You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) at dinner
last week. Your name happened to come up in conversation, in
connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the
Dudley. Staveley curled his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) lip and said that you might have the most
artistic tastes, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl
should be allowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the
same room with. I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I was a friend of yours, and asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me right out before everybody.
It was horrible! Why is your friendship so fatal to young men? There
was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide. You were
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) great friend. There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England
with a tarnished name. You and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) were inseparable. What about Adrian
Singleton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) dreadful end? What about Lord Kent's only son and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) career? I met his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) father yesterday in St. James's Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
seemed broken with shame and sorrow. What about the young Duke of
Perth? What sort of life has he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) got now? What gentleman would
associate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian Gray, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lip, and with a note of infinite contempt
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it.
It is because I know everything about his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) life, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) knows
anything about mine. With such blood as he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) veins, how could
his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) record be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth.
Did I teach the one his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) vices, and the other his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) debauchery? If Kent's
silly son takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) wife from the streets, what is that to me? If
Adrian Singleton writes his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) friend's name across a bill, am I his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>)
keeper? I know how people chatter in England. The middle classes air
their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper
about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try
and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with
the people they slander. In this country, it is enough for a man to
have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead
themselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land
of the hypocrite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried Hallward, <div class="bookquote">``that is not the question. England is bad
enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason
why I want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a right to
judge of a man by the effect he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends. Yours seem to
lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them
with a madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You
led them there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as
you are smiling now. And there is worse behind. I know you and Harry
are inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should
not have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sister's name a by-word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Basil. You go too far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met
Lady Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>). Is there
a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the
park? Why, even her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children are not allowed to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Then
there are other stories--stories that you have been seen creeping at
dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest
dens in London. Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard
them, I laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What
about your country-house and the life that is led there? Dorian, you
don't know what is said about you. I won't tell you that I don't want
to preach to you. I remember Harry saying once that every man who
turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by
saying that, and then proceeded to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) word. I do want to preach
to you. I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect
you. I want you to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to
get rid of the dreadful people you associate with. Don't shrug your
shoulders like that. Don't be so indifferent. You have a wonderful
influence. Let it be for good, not for evil. They say that you
corrupt every one with whom you become intimate, and that it is quite
sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow
after. I don't know whether it is so or not. How should I know? But
it is said of you. I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt.
Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) showed me
a letter that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wife had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was dying alone in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) villa at Mentone. Your name was implicated in the most terrible
confession I ever read. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) that it was absurd--that I knew you
thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind. Know
you? I wonder do I know you? Before I could answer that, I should
have to see your soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see my soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and
turning almost white from fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
voice, <div class="bookquote">``to see your soul. But only God can do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/>A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. <div class="bookquote">``You
shall see it yourself, to-night!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, seizing a lamp from the
table. <div class="bookquote">``Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn't you look at
it? You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose.
Nobody would believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me
all the better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you
will prate about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have
chattered enough about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to
face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was the madness of pride in every word he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uttered. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stamped
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot upon the ground in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boyish insolent manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt a
terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) secret,
and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of
all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shame was to be burdened for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life with the
hideous memory of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued, coming closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and looking steadfastly into
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stern eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing
that you fancy only God can see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward started back. <div class="bookquote">``This is blasphemy, Dorian!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You
must not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don't mean
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) laughed again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your
good. You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't touch me. Finish what you have to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div><p/>A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) paused for
a moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). After all, what
right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had done a
tithe of what was rumoured about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) must have suffered!
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and
stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and
their throbbing cores of flame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am waiting, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man in a hard clear voice.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned round. <div class="bookquote">``What I have to say is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You must
give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against
you. If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to
end, I shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can't you see
what I am going through? My God! don't tell me that you are bad, and
corrupt, and shameful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Come
upstairs, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I keep a diary of my life from day
to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall
show it to you if you come with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my
train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don't ask me to
read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You
will not have to read long.''



 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 13

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward
following close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at
night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A
rising wind made some of the windows rattle.

<p/>When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the
floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock. <div class="bookquote">``You insist on
knowing, Basil?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) asked in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered, smiling. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) added, somewhat
harshly, <div class="bookquote">``You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know
everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you
think'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and, taking up the lamp, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) opened the door and went in. A
cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in
a flame of murky orange. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``Shut the door behind you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
whispered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) placed the lamp on the table.

<p/>Hallward glanced round him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) with a puzzled expression. The room looked
as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a
curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty
book-case--that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and
a table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was
standing on the mantelshelf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) saw that the whole place was covered
with dust and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling
behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that
curtain back, and you will see mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. <div class="bookquote">``You are mad, Dorian, or
playing a part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>muttered Hallward, frowning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't? Then I must do it myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) tore
the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.

<p/>An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) saw in the
dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>). There was
something in its expression that filled him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) with disgust and loathing.
Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray's own face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was looking at!
The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that
marvellous beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and
some scarlet on the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes had kept something
of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet
completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat.
Yes, it was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) seemed to
recognize his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own brushwork, and the frame was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own design. The
idea was monstrous, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) seized the lighted candle,
and held it to the picture. In the left-hand corner was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own name,
traced in long letters of bright vermilion.

<p/>It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had never
done that. Still, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own picture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) knew it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt as
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
own picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) turned and
looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) mouth twitched,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.

<p/>The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with
that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are
absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither
real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the
spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had taken
the flower out of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does this mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried Hallward, at last. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own voice sounded
shrill and curious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Years ago, when I was a boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my
good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who
explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me
that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even
now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you
would call it a prayer...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is
impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The
paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the
thing is impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what is impossible?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>murmured the young man, going over to the
window and leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You told me you had destroyed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wrong. It has destroyed me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it is my picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you see your ideal in it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My ideal, as you call it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you called it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such
an ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the face of my soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a
devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Each of us has heaven and hell in him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian with a
wild gesture of despair.

<p/>Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. <div class="bookquote">``My God! If it
is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``and this is what you have done with your life,
why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you
to be!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) held the light up again to the canvas and examined it. The
surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had left it. It was
from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come.
Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were
slowly eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery
grave was not so fearful.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and
lay there sputtering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) foot on it and put it out. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table
and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was no
answer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) could hear the young man sobbing at the window. <div class="bookquote">``Pray,
Dorian, pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) murmured. ``What is it that one was taught to say in
one's boyhood? ``Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our sins.
Wash away our iniquities.<div class="bookquote">'' Let us say that together. The prayer of
your pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be
answered also. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You
worshipped yourself too much. We are both punished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) with tear-dimmed
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It is too late, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) faltered.

<p/>``It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot
remember a prayer. Isn't there a verse somewhere, <div class="bookquote">``Though your sins be
as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those words mean nothing to me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Don't say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My
God! Don't you see that accursed thing leering at us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable
feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), as though it had
been suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) by the image on the canvas, whispered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a hunted animal
stirred within him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) loathed the man who was seated at the table,
more than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) whole life he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had ever loathed anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) glanced
wildly around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest
that faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) eye fell on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) knew what it was. It was a
knife that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord,
and had forgotten to take away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) moved slowly towards it,
passing Hallward as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) did so. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) got behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) seized
it and turned round. Hallward stirred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) chair as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was going
to rise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) and dug the knife into the great vein that
is behind the ear, crushing the man's head down on the table and
stabbing again and again.

<p/>There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking
with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,
waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
twice more, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on
the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw the knife on the table, and listened.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
opened the door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely
quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood bending over the
balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so.

<p/>The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with
bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been
for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was
slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was
simply asleep.

<p/>How quickly it had all been done! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt strangely calm, and walking
over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The wind
had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock's
tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked down and saw the
policeman going his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rounds and flashing the long beam of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lantern on
the doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom
gleamed at the corner and then vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl
was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went. Now and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped and peered back. Once, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to sing in a hoarse
voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
stumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The
gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their
black iron branches to and fro. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) shivered and went back, closing the
window behind him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>).

<p/>Having reached the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) turned the key and opened it. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) did not
even glance at the murdered man. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) felt that the secret of the whole
thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had painted the
fatal portrait to which all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) misery had been due had gone out of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
life. That was enough.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish
workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished
steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it might be missed
by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) servant, and questions would be asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hesitated for a
moment, then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turned back and took it from the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not
help seeing the dead thing. How still it was! How horribly white the
long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax image.

<p/>Having locked the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) crept quietly downstairs. The
woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stopped
several times and waited. No: everything was still. It was merely
the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own footsteps.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reached the library, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw the bag and coat in the corner.
They must be hidden away somewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) unlocked a secret press that
was in the wainscoting, a press in which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own curious
disguises, and put them into it. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could easily burn them afterwards.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) watch. It was twenty minutes to two.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sat down and began to think. Every year--every month, almost--men
were strangled in England for what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had done. There had been a
madness of murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the
earth... And yet, what evidence was there against him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? Basil Hallward
had left the house at eleven. No one had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) come in again. Most
of the servants were at Selby Royal. His (<font color='blue'><b>Royal</b></font>) valet had gone to bed...
Paris! Yes. It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight
train, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had intended. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) curious reserved habits, it would
be months before any suspicions would be roused. Months! Everything
could be destroyed long before then.

<p/>A sudden thought struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) fur coat and hat and went
out into the hall. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of
the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the
bull's-eye reflected in the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) waited and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) breath.

<p/>After a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting
the door very gently behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) began ringing the bell. In
about five minutes his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very
drowsy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) said, stepping in;
<div class="bookquote">``but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes past two, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the man, looking at the clock and
blinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine
to-morrow. I have some work to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did any one call this evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hallward, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) stayed here till eleven, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) went away
to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I am sorry I didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) leave any message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would write to you from Paris, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) did not
find you at the club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do, Francis. Don't forget to call me at nine to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man shambled down the passage in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slippers.

<p/>Dorian Gray threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hat and coat upon the table and passed into the
library. For a quarter of an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) walked up and down the room,
biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lip and thinking. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) took down the Blue Book from one
of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves. <div class="bookquote">``Alan Campbell, 152,
Hertford Street, Mayfair.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes; that was the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted.



<p/>CHAPTER 14

<p/>At nine o'clock the next morning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) servant came in with a cup of
chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite
peacefully, lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) right side, with one hand underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
cheek. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.

<p/>The man had to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) twice on the shoulder before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) woke, and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes a faint smile passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not dreamed at all.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain.
But youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned round, and leaning upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow, began to sip his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. The
sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was
almost like a morning in May.

<p/>Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,
blood-stained feet into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain and reconstructed themselves there
with terrible distinctness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) winced at the memory of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for
Basil Hallward that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) sat in the chair came
back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) grew cold with passion. The dead man was still
sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was!
Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brooded on what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone through he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would sicken
or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory
than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride
more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of
joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the
senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out
of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might
strangle one itself.

<p/>When the half-hour struck, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) forehead, and
then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) usual
care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) necktie and
scarf-pin and changing his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) rings more than once. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) spent a long time
also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) valet
about some new liveries that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was thinking of getting made for the
servants at Selby, and going through his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) correspondence. At some of
the letters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) smiled. Three of them bored him (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>). One he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) read several
times over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>)
face. <div class="bookquote">``That awful thing, a woman's memory!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>as Lord Henry had once
said.

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) had drunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) cup of black coffee, he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) lips slowly
with a napkin, motioned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) servant to wait, and going over to the
table, sat down and wrote two letters. One he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) pocket, the
other he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) handed to the valet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell
is out of town, get his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) address.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) was alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a
piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and
then human faces. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) remarked that every face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) drew
seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) frowned, and
getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would not think about what had happened until
it became absolutely necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) should do so.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had stretched himself on the sofa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) looked at the title-page
of the book. It was Gautier's Emaux et Camees, Charpentier's
Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was
of citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted
pomegranates. It had been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) by Adrian Singleton. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>)
turned over the pages, his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) eye fell on the poem about the hand of
Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand <div class="bookquote">''_du supplice encore mal lavee_,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with
its downy red hairs and its <div class="bookquote">''_doigts de faune_.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) own
white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and
passed on, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:

<p/>Sur une gamme chromatique,
Le sein de peries ruisselant,
La Venus de l``Adriatique
Sort de l'eau son corps rose et blanc.

<p/>Les domes, sur l'azur des ondes
Suivant la phrase au pur contour,
S'enflent comme des gorges rondes
Que souleve un soupir d'amour.

<p/>L'esquif aborde et me depose,
Jetant son amarre au pilier,
Devant une facade rose,
Sur le marbre d'un escalier.


<p/>How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating
down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black
gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked
to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as
one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the
tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through
the dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
kept saying over and over to himself:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Devant une facade rose,
Sur le marbre d'un escalier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) remembered the autumn
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) to
mad delightful follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice,
like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true
romantic, background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had
been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor
Basil! What a horrible way for a man to die!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read
of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _cafe_ at Smyrna where
the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants
smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of
granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot,
lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and
white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes
that crawl over the green steaming mud; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to brood over those
verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that
curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the <div class="bookquote">''_monstre
charmant_''  (<font color='red'><b>contralto</b></font>)</div>that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre. But after a
time the book fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew nervous, and a horrible fit
of terror came over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What if Alan Campbell should be out of
England? Days would elapse before he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) could come back. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
might refuse to come. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) do then? Every moment was of
vital importance.

<p/>They had been great friends once, five years before--almost
inseparable, indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end.
When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan
Campbell never did.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was an extremely clever young man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had no real
appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the
beauty of poetry he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) possessed he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had gained entirely from Dorian. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had
spent a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) time working in the laboratory, and had taken
a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) year. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was
still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
own in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the
annoyance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) mother, who had set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) standing for
Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up
prescriptions. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) was an excellent musician, however, as well, and
played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In
fact, it was music that had first brought him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) and Dorian Gray
together--music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to
be able to exercise whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) wished--and, indeed, exercised often
without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire's the
night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always
seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For
eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at
Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>), as to many others, Dorian
Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in
life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one
ever knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when
they met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any
party at which Dorian Gray was present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had changed, too--was
strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing
music, and would never himself play, giving as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) excuse, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was
called upon, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was so absorbed in science that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had no time
left in which to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
seemed to become more interested in biology, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) name appeared once
or twice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain
curious experiments.

<p/>This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) kept
glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) became horribly
agitated. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) got up and began to pace up and down the room,
looking like a beautiful caged thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) took long stealthy strides.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hands were curiously cold.

<p/>The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to be crawling with
feet of lead, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) by monstrous winds was being swept towards the
jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) knew what was waiting
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) burning lids as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) would have robbed the very brain of sight
and driven the eyeballs back into their cave. It was useless. The
brain had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made
grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,
danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving
masks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Yes: that blind,
slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being
dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its
grave, and showed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stared at it. Its very horror made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stone.

<p/>At last the door opened and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) servant entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) turned glazed eyes
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Campbell, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.

<p/>A sigh of relief broke from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parched lips, and the colour came back
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) to come in at once, Francis.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was himself
again. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mood of cowardice had passed away.

<p/>The man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,
looking very stern and rather pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) pallor being intensified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it
was a matter of life and death.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) voice was hard and cold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
spoke with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the
steady searching gaze that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) turned on Dorian. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) hands in
the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the
gesture with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had been greeted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one
person. Sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alan/Campbell/Alan Campbell</b></font>)</div><p/>Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).
The two men's eyes met. In Dorian's there was infinite pity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) knew
that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was going to do was dreadful.

<p/>After a strained moment of silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) leaned across and said, very
quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
had sent for, <div class="bookquote">``Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room
to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been dead ten hours now. Don't stir, and don't look at me like
that. Who the man is, why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died, how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died, are matters that do
not concern you. What you have to do is this--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Gray. I don't want to know anything further. Whether what you
have told me is true or not true doesn't concern me. I entirely
decline to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to
yourself. They don't interest me any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest
you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can't help myself. You
are the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into
the matter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know
about chemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments.
What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs--to
destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left. Nobody saw this
person come into the house. Indeed, at the present moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) is
supposed to be in Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) will not be missed for months. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) is
missed, there must be no trace of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) found here. You, Alan, you must
change him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>), and everything that belongs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>), into a handful of ashes
that I may scatter in the air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mad, Dorian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mad, I tell you--mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to
help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing
to do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to
peril my reputation for you? What is it to me what devil's work you
are up to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was suicide, Alan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of that. But who drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) to it? You, I should fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you still refuse to do this for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I
don't care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not
be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask
me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should
have thought you knew more about people's characters. Your friend Lord
Henry Wotton can't have taught you much about psychology, whatever else
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) has taught you. Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you.
You have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don't
come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alan, it was murder. I killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>). You don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) had made
me suffer. Whatever my life is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) had more to do with the making or
the marring of it than poor Harry has had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) may not have intended
it, the result was the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not
inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring
in the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a
crime without doing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do
with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to
me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain
scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the
horrors that you do there don't affect you. If in some hideous
dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a
leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow
through, you would simply look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as an admirable subject. You
would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing
anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were
benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the
world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.
What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.
Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are
accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence
against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be
discovered unless you help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply
indifferent to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you
came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some
day. No! don't think of that. Look at the matter purely from the
scientific point of view. You don't inquire where the dead things on
which you experiment come from. Don't inquire now. I have told you
too much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once,
Alan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak about those days, Dorian--they are dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan!
Alan! If you don't come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will
hang me, Alan! Don't you understand? They will hang me for what I
have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do
anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You refuse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I entreat you, Alan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is useless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stretched
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the
table. Having done this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) got up and went over to the window.

<p/>Campbell looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) in surprise, and then took up the paper, and
opened it. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) read it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) face became ghastly pale and he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) fell
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.

<p/>After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and
came and stood behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry for you, Alan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``but you leave me no
alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see
the address. If you don't help me, I must send it. If you don't help
me, I will send it. You know what the result will be. But you are
going to help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to
spare you. You will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern,
harsh, offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat
me--no living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to
dictate terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Campbell buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) hands, and a shudder passed through him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are.
The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work yourself into this fever.
The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alan/Campbell/Alan Campbell</b></font>)</div><p/>A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) shivered all over. The
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) to be dividing
time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be
borne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
forehead, as if the disgrace with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was threatened had already
come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). The hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) shoulder weighed like a hand of lead.
It was intolerable. It seemed to crush him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Alan, you must decide at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) said, mechanically, as though words could alter
things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must. You have no choice. Don't delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Is there a fire in the room upstairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of
notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the
things back to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alan/Campbell/Alan Campbell</b></font>)</div><p/>Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) rang the bell and gave it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) valet, with orders to return as
soon as possible and to bring the things with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).

<p/>As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up
from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was shivering with a
kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A
fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was
like the beat of a hammer.

<p/>As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian
Gray, saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) eyes were filled with tears. There was something in
the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You are infamous, absolutely infamous!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) muttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, Alan. You have saved my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from
corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime. In
doing what I am going to do--what you force me to do--it is not of your
life that I am thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Alan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>murmured Dorian with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you had a thousandth
part of the pity for me that I have for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) turned away as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer.

<p/>After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant
entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil
of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I leave the things here, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) asked Campbell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian. <div class="bookquote">``And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another
errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies
Selby with orchids?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harden, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden
personally, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harden</b></font>) to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,
and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I don't want any
white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty
place--otherwise I wouldn't bother you about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian looked at Campbell. <div class="bookquote">``How long will your experiment take, Alan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third person in
the room seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) extraordinary courage.

<p/>Campbell frowned and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``It will take about five hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,
Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can
have the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not
want you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, leaving the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!
I'll take it for you. You bring the other things.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) spoke rapidly
and in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). They
left the room together.

<p/>When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned
it in the lock. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) stopped, and a troubled look came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I can go in, Alan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing to me. I don't require you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alan/Campbell/Alan Campbell</b></font>)</div>said Campbell coldly.

<p/>Dorian half opened the door. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) saw the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
portrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn
curtain was lying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) remembered that the night before he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had
forgotten, for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) life, to hide the fatal canvas,
and was about to rush forward, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) drew back with a shudder.

<p/>What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on
one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible
it was!--more horrible, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) for the moment, than the
silent thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) knew was stretched across the table, the thing
whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) that
it had not stirred, but was still there, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had left it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with
half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down and
taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) flung it right over the
picture.

<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) eyes fixed
themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) heard
Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other
things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had required for his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) dreadful work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) began to wonder
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had
thought of each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said a stern voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been
thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a
glistening yellow face. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was going downstairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) heard the key
being turned in the lock.

<p/>It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
was pale, but absolutely calm. <div class="bookquote">``I have done what you asked me to do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian
simply.

<p/>As soon as Campbell had left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) went upstairs. There was a horrible
smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting
at the table was gone.



<p/>CHAPTER 15

<p/>That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large
button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady
Narborough's drawing-room by bowing servants. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) forehead was
throbbing with maddened nerves, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt wildly excited, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hostess's hand was as easy and graceful as
ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one's ease as when one has to
play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could
have believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any
tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have
clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God
and goodness. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) himself could not help wondering at the calm of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a
double life.

<p/>It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who
was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the
remains of really remarkable ugliness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) had proved an excellent
wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>)
husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) had herself designed,
and married off her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>)
devoted herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery,
and French _esprit_ when she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) could get it.

<p/>Dorian was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) especial favourites, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) always told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) was extremely glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) had not met him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) in early life. <div class="bookquote">``I know, my
dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) used to say,
<div class="bookquote">``and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake. It is most
fortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it was, our
bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to
raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.
However, that was all Narborough's fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) was dreadfully
short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who
never sees anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>)
explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) married
daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>), and, to make
matters worse, had actually brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) husband with her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I think it
is most unkind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>), my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I go and
stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old
woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake
them up. You don't know what an existence they lead down there. It is
pure unadulterated country life. They get up early, because they have
so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to
think about. There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since
the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep
after dinner. You shan't sit next either of them. You shall sit by me
and amuse me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes:
it was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had never seen
before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those
middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,
but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an
overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always
trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruxton</b></font>) great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruxton</b></font>); Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and
Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) hostess's daughter, a dowdy
dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once
seen, are never remembered; and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband, a red-cheeked,
white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) class, was under the
impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of
ideas.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was rather sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the
great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the
mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``How horrid of Henry Wotton to be
so late! I sent round to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) this morning on chance and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) promised
faithfully not to disappoint me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div><p/>It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door
opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slow musical voice lending charm to some
insincere apology, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ceased to feel bored.

<p/>But at dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away
untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``an
insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
now and then Lord Henry looked across at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), wondering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) silence
and abstracted manner. From time to time the butler filled his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) glass
with champagne. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) drank eagerly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) thirst seemed to increase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being handed
round, <div class="bookquote">``what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out of
sorts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Narborough, <div class="bookquote">``and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is
afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is quite right. I
certainly should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>murmured Dorian, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I have not been in
love for a whole week--not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How you men can fall in love with that woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old lady.
<div class="bookquote">``I really cannot understand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remembers you when you were a little girl,
Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is the one link between us and
your short frocks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I
remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _decolletee_
she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) was then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is still _decolletee_,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered, taking an olive in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) long
fingers; <div class="bookquote">``and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is in a very smart gown she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) looks like an
_edition de luxe_ of a bad French novel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is really wonderful, and
full of surprises. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) capacity for family affection is extraordinary.
When her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) third husband died, her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) hair turned quite gold from grief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a most romantic explanation,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div>laughed the hostess. <div class="bookquote">``But her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>)
third husband, Lord Henry! You don't mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Lady Narborough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe a word of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, ask Mr. Gray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) most intimate friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it true, Mr. Gray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) assures me so, Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian. <div class="bookquote">``I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>)
whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) had their hearts embalmed and
hung at her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) girdle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) didn't, because none of them had
had any hearts at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Four husbands! Upon my word that is _trop de zele_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Trop d'audace_, I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol
like? I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wine.

<p/>Lady Narborough hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) fan. <div class="bookquote">``Lord Henry, I am not at all
surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what world says that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Henry, elevating his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyebrows.
<div class="bookquote">``It can only be the next world. This world and I are on excellent
terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody I know says you are very wicked,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady,
shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head.

<p/>Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. <div class="bookquote">``It is perfectly
monstrous,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, at last, <div class="bookquote">``the way people go about nowadays saying
things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely
true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) incorrigible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian, leaning forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hostess, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``But really, if you all
worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry
again so as to be in the fashion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>broke in Lord Henry.
<div class="bookquote">``You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
detested her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
adored his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Narborough wasn't perfect,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been, you would not have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), my dear lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the
rejoinder. <div class="bookquote">``Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them,
they will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will never
ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough,
but it is quite true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for
your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be
married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however,
that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married men live like
bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Fin de siecle_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Fin du globe_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hostess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it were _fin du globe_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Life is a
great disappointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Narborough, putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) gloves, <div class="bookquote">``don't
tell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that one knows
that life has exhausted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Lord Henry is very wicked, and I
sometimes wish that I had been; but you are made to be good--you look
so good. I must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don't you think
that Mr. Gray should get married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am always telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) so, Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry with a
bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). I shall go
through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the
eligible young ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With their ages, Lady Narborough?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>asked Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done
in a hurry. I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable
alliance, and I want you both to be happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lord
Henry. <div class="bookquote">``A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not love
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! what a cynic you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady, pushing back her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair
and nodding to Lady Ruxton. <div class="bookquote">``You must come and dine with me soon
again. You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir
Andrew prescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would like
to meet, though. I want it to be a delightful gathering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like men who have a future and women who have a past,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered.
<div class="bookquote">``Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, laughing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood up. <div class="bookquote">``A thousand pardons,
my dear Lady Ruxton,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't see you hadn't finished your
cigarette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I am
going to limit myself, for the future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't, Lady Ruxton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Moderation is a fatal
thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a
feast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Ruxton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Ruxton glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) curiously. <div class="bookquote">``You must come and explain that
to me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruxton</b></font>)
murmured, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruxton</b></font>) swept out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mind you don't stay too long over your politics and scandal,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Narborough from the door. <div class="bookquote">``If you do, we are sure to
squabble upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the
table and came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) seat and went
and sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about
the situation in the House of Commons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) guffawed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) adversaries.
The word _doctrinaire_--word full of terror to the British
mind--reappeared from time to time between his (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) explosions. An
alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) hoisted the
Union Jack on the pinnacles of thought. The inherited stupidity of the
race--sound English common sense he (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) jovially termed it--was shown to be
the proper bulwark for society.

<p/>A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) turned round and looked at
Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you better, my dear fellow?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``You seemed rather out of
sorts at dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to
you. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) is going down to Selby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) has promised to come on the twentieth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Monmouth to be there, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bores her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) is very
clever, too clever for a woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) lacks the indefinable charm of
weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image
precious. Her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.
White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire,
and what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) has had experiences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long has she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) been married?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>asked Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An eternity, she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is
ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity,
with time thrown in. Who else is coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wife, our hostess, Geoffrey
Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``A great many people don't, but I find
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) charming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by
being always absolutely over-educated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is a very modern type.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will be able to come, Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) may have to go to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! what a nuisance people's people are! Try and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) come. By
the way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before
eleven. What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hurriedly and frowned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``I did not get home till nearly three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you go to the club?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``No, I don't mean that. I
didn't go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I did... How
inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has been
doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at
half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my
latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any
corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, as if I cared!
Let us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.
Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are
not yourself to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall
come round and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady
Narborough. I shan't go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.
The duchess is coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try to be there, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, leaving the room. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
drove back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was conscious that the sense of terror
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had strangled had come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Lord Henry's casual
questioning had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nerve for the moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wanted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nerve still. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
winced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hated the idea of even touching them.

<p/>Yet it had to be done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) realized that, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had locked the
door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) library, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opened the secret press into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had
thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
piled another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning
leather was horrible. It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) three-quarters of an hour to consume
everything. At the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt faint and sick, and having lit some
Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) bathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) hands and
forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.

<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) started. His (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) eyes grew strangely bright, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) gnawed
nervously at his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large
Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue
lapis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate
and make afraid, as though it held something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) longed for and yet
almost loathed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) breath quickened. A mad craving came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) eyelids drooped till
the long fringed lashes almost touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) cheek. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) still watched
the cabinet. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) got up from the sofa on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) had been
lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden
spring. A triangular drawer passed slowly out. His (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) fingers moved
instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something. It was a
small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought,
the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with
round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) opened it.
Inside was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and
persistent.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>)
face. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly
hot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty
minutes to twelve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) did so, and went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) bedroom.

<p/>As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,
dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) throat, crept
quietly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) house. In Bond Street he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) found a hansom with a good
horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.

<p/>The man shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It is too far for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is a sovereign for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian. <div class="bookquote">``You shall have another if
you drive fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the man, <div class="bookquote">``you will be there in an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) fare had got in he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) horse round and drove rapidly
towards the river.



<p/>CHAPTER 16

<p/>A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly
in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men
and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors. From
some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others,
drunkards brawled and screamed.

<p/>Lying back in the hansom, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hat pulled over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) forehead, Dorian
Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and
now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) on the first day they had met, <div class="bookquote">``To cure the soul by means of the
senses, and the senses by means of the soul.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Yes, that was the
secret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were
opium dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the
memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were
new.

<p/>The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a
huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The
gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the
man lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from
the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The sidewindows of the hansom
were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of
the soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How the words rang in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears! His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, certainly, was
sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent
blood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there
was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness
was possible still, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was determined to forget, to stamp the thing
out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.
Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had done? Who
had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) a judge over others? He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had said things that were
dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.

<p/>On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), at each
step. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster.
The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) throat burned
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) delicate hands twitched nervously together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) struck at the
horse madly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) stick. The driver laughed and whipped up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
laughed in answer, and the man was silent.

<p/>The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some
sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist
thickened, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt afraid.

<p/>Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,
fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away in
the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a
rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.

<p/>After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over
rough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then
fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes and made
gestures like live things. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated them. A dull rage was in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
heart. As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from
an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred
yards. The driver beat at them with his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whip.

<p/>It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with
hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped
those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had found in
them the full expression, as it were, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) mood, and justified, by
intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would
still have dominated his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) temper. From cell to cell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) brain crept
the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all
man's appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.
Ugliness that had once been hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) because it made things real,
became dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one
reality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of
disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more
vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious
shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song. They were what he (<font color='blue'><b>outcast</b></font>) needed
for forgetfulness. In three days he (<font color='blue'><b>outcast</b></font>) would be free.

<p/>Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over
the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black
masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the
yards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Somewhere about here, sir, ain't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked huskily through the
trap.

<p/>Dorian started and peered round. <div class="bookquote">``This will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered, and
having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had
promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here and
there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The
light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an
outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like
a wet mackintosh.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) reached a small
shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of
the top-windows stood a lamp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) stopped and gave a peculiar knock.

<p/>After a little time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heard steps in the passage and the chain being
unhooked. The door opened quietly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) went in without saying a
word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the
shadow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered green
curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
in from the street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) dragged it aside and entered a long low room
which looked as if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill
flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that
faced them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed
tin backed them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was
covered with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud,
and stained with dark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were
crouching by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and
showing their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malays</b></font>)
head buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malays</b></font>) arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the
tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two
haggard women, mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
coat with an expression of disgust. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s got red ants on
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
in terror and began to whimper.

<p/>At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a
darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the
heavy odour of opium met him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heaved a deep breath, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
nostrils quivered with pleasure. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) entered, a young man with
smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin
pipe, looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and nodded in a hesitating manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You here, Adrian?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>muttered Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where else should I be?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered, listlessly. <div class="bookquote">``None of the chaps
will speak to me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you had left England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at
last. George doesn't speak to me either... I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) added
with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``As long as one has this stuff, one doesn't want friends.
I think I have had too many friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such
fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the
gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) knew in
what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were
teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better off than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was
eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) soul away. From time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) seemed to see the eyes of
Basil Hallward looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) could not stay. The
presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) wanted to be where no
one would know who he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) wanted to escape from himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going on to the other place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) said after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the wharf?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) in this place
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``I am sick of women who love one.
Women who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have
something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>murmured the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Adrian Singleton/Adrian</b></font>)</div><p/>Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. A
half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous
greeting as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of
them. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
back on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.

<p/>A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of
the women. <div class="bookquote">``We are very proud to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) sneered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For God's sake don't talk to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian, stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) foot on
the ground. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want? Money? Here it is. Don't ever talk
to me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman's sodden eyes, then
flickered out and left them dull and glazed. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and
raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companion
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enviously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adrian Singleton/Adrian</b></font>)</div>sighed Adrian Singleton. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care to go back.
What does it matter? I am quite happy here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will write to me if you want anything, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian,
after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) parched mouth with a handkerchief.

<p/>Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) face. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) drew
the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the
woman who had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) money. <div class="bookquote">``There goes the devil's bargain!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Curse you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``don't call me that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) snapped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``Prince Charming is what you like to be
called, ain't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yelled after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).

<p/>The drowsy sailor leaped to his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) feet as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke, and looked wildly
round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) ear. He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)
rushed out as if in pursuit.

<p/>Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) wondered
if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) door, as
Basil Hallward had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) with such infamy of insult. He (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>)
lip, and for a few seconds his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) eyes grew sad. Yet, after all, what did
it matter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>)? One's days were too brief to take the burden of
another's errors on one's shoulders. Each man lived his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own life and
paid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so
often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dealings with man, destiny never closed her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accounts.

<p/>There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or
for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of
the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful
impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their
will. They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is
taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at
all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its
charm. For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are
sins of disobedience. When that high spirit, that morning star of
evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) fell.

<p/>Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for
rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) step as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) went, but
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) often as a
short cut to the ill-famed place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was going, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt himself
suddenly seized from behind, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had time to defend himself,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
throat.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the
tightening fingers away. In a second he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) heard the click of a revolver,
and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head,
and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``If you stir, I shoot you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mad. What have I done to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer, <div class="bookquote">``and Sibyl Vane
was my sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) killed herself. I know it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) death is at your
door. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought
you. I had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have described
you were dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) used to call
you. I heard it to-night by chance. Make your peace with God, for
to-night you are going to die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray grew sick with fear. <div class="bookquote">``I never knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stammered. <div class="bookquote">``I
never heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>). You are mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you
are going to die.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know
what to say or do. <div class="bookquote">``Down on your knees!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>growled the man. <div class="bookquote">``I give you
one minute to make your peace--no more. I go on board to-night for
India, and I must do my job first. One minute. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian's arms fell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) side. Paralysed with terror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) did not know
what to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) brain. <div class="bookquote">``Stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
cried. <div class="bookquote">``How long ago is it since your sister died? Quick, tell me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighteen years,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask me? What do years
matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighteen years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
voice. <div class="bookquote">``Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my face!''

 (<font color='red'><b>James Vane/James</b></font>)</div><p/>James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) seized Dorian Gray and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) from the archway.

<p/>Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>)
the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) had fallen, for the face
of the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the
unstained purity of youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed little more than a lad of twenty
summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister had been
when they had parted so many years ago. It was obvious that this was
not the man who had destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) life.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hold and reeled back. <div class="bookquote">``My God! my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``and
I would have murdered you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray drew a long breath. <div class="bookquote">``You have been on the brink of
committing a terrible crime, my man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) sternly.
<div class="bookquote">``Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own
hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>James Vane/James</b></font>)</div>muttered James Vane. <div class="bookquote">``I was deceived. A chance
word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into
trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heel and going slowly down the
street.

<p/>James Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was trembling from head
to foot. After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping
along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>)
with stealthy footsteps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) felt a hand laid on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) arm and looked
round with a start. It was one of the women who had been drinking at
the bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hissed out, putting haggard face quite
close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I knew you were following him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when you rushed out from
Daly's. You fool! You should have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Daly</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Daly</b></font>) has lots of money,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Daly</b></font>)'s as bad as bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Daly</b></font>) is not the man I am looking for,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``and I want no man's
money. I want a man's life. The man whose life I want must be nearly
forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I have not
got his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) blood upon my hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman gave a bitter laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Little more than a boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sneered.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, man, it's nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me
what I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You lie!''  (<font color='red'><b>James Vane/James</b></font>)</div>cried James Vane.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand up to heaven. <div class="bookquote">``Before God I am telling the truth,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before God?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strike me dumb if it ain't so. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is the worst one that comes here.
They say he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. It's nigh
on eighteen years since I met him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hasn't changed much since then.
I have, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, with a sickly leer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You swear this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I swear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came in hoarse echo from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flat mouth. <div class="bookquote">``But don't give
me away to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whined; <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). Let me have some
money for my night's lodging.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street,
but Dorian Gray had disappeared. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) looked back, the woman had
vanished also.



<p/>CHAPTER 17

<p/>A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby
Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) husband,
a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guests. It was tea-time,
and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the
table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at
which the duchess was presiding. Her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) white hands were moving daintily
among the cups, and her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) full red lips were smiling at something that
Dorian had whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>). Lord Henry was lying back in a
silk-draped wicker chair, looking at them. On a peach-coloured divan
sat Lady Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke's description of
the last Brazilian beetle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) collection. Three
young men in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of
the women. The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were
more expected to arrive on the next day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you two talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, strolling over to
the table and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cup down. <div class="bookquote">``I hope Dorian has told you about
my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't want to be rechristened, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>rejoined the duchess,
looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) wonderful eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I am quite satisfied with
my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are
both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an
orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as
effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked
one of the gardeners what it was called. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) told me it was a fine
specimen of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind. It is a
sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to
things. Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one
quarrel is with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in
literature. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled
to use one. It is the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is fit for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what should we call you, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) name is Prince Paradox,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in a flash,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the duchess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't hear of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair. <div class="bookquote">``From
a label there is no escape! I refuse the title.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Royalties may not abdicate,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>fell as a warning from pretty lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wish me to defend my throne, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I give the truths of to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I prefer the mistakes of to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You disarm me, Gladys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cried, catching the wilfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) mood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never tilt against beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is your error, Harry, believe me. You value beauty far too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be
beautiful than to be good. But on the other hand, no one is more ready
than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>cried the duchess.
<div class="bookquote">``What becomes of your simile about the orchid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good
Tory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly
virtues have made our England what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't like your country, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I live in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you may censure it the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do they say of us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that yours, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I give it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not use it. It is too true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a description.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are practical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger,
they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, we have done great things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have carried their burden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only as far as the Stock Exchange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I believe in the race,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It represents the survival of the pushing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has development.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decay fascinates me more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What of art?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a malady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An illusion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Religion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fashionable substitute for belief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a sceptic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! Scepticism is the beginning of faith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To define is to limit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a clue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Threads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our host is a delightful topic. Years ago he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was christened Prince
Charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! don't remind me of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our host is rather horrid this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>answered the duchess,
colouring. <div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) thinks that Monmouth married me on purely
scientific principles as the best specimen he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could find of a modern
butterfly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) won't stick pins into you, Duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>laughed Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) is annoyed with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) get annoyed with you about, Duchess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because
I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) that I must be dressed by
half-past eight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How unreasonable of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)! You should give her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) warning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I daren't, Mr. Gray. Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) invents hats for me. You remember the
one I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden-party? You don't, but it is nice
of you to pretend that you do. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) made it out of nothing. All
good hats are made out of nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like all good reputations, Gladys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Every
effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be
a mediocrity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not with women,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``and women rule
the world. I assure you we can't bear mediocrities. We women, as some
one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if
you ever love at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that we never do anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>murmured Dorian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>answered the duchess with
mock sadness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Gladys!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``How can you say that? Romance
lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.
Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.
Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely
intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best,
and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as
possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>asked the duchess after
a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially when one has been wounded by it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry.

<p/>The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression
in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) inquired.

<p/>Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head back and
laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I always agree with Harry, Duchess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry is never wrong, Duchess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And does his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) philosophy make you happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have
searched for pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And found it, Mr. Gray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Often. Too often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The duchess</b></font>)</div><p/>The duchess sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I am searching for peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and if I
don't go and dress, I shall have none this evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian, starting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
feet and walking down the conservatory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are flirting disgracefully with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
cousin. <div class="bookquote">``You had better take care. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is very fascinating.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) were not, there would be no battle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Greek meets Greek, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were defeated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are worse things than capture,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You gallop with a loose rein.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pace gives life,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the _riposte_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall write it in my diary to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That a burnt child loves the fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not even singed. My wings are untouched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You use them for everything, except flight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Courage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a rival.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) perfectly adores
him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You fill me with apprehension. The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us
who are romanticists.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Romanticists! You have all the methods of science.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Men have educated us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not explained you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Describe us as a sex,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) challenge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sphinxes without secrets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), smiling. <div class="bookquote">``How long Mr. Gray is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Let us
go and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). I have not yet told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) the colour of my frock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you must suit your frock to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) flowers, Gladys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be a premature surrender.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Romantic art begins with its climax.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must keep an opportunity for retreat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the Parthian manner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They found safety in the desert. I could not do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women are not always allowed a choice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered, but hardly had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came
a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall. Everybody
started up. The duchess stood motionless in horror. And with fear in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian
Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of
the sofas. After a short time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) came to himself and looked round
with a dazed expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! I remember. Am I safe here,
Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) began to tremble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry, <div class="bookquote">``you merely fainted. That was
all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down
to dinner. I will take your place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I will come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, struggling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``I would
rather come down. I must not be alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of
gaiety in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sat at table, but now and then a thrill of
terror ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remembered that, pressed against the
window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had seen the
face of James Vane watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER 18

<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the
time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet
indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared,
tracked down, had begun to dominate him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>). If the tapestry did but
tremble in the wind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) shook. The dead leaves that were blown against
the leaded panes seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) like his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) own wasted resolutions and wild
regrets. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) saw again the sailor's face
peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to
lay its hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) heart.

<p/>But perhaps it had been only his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) fancy that had called vengeance out of
the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>). Actual
life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the
imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet
of sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen
brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor
the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust
upon the weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling
round the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would have been seen by the servants or the
keepers. Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the
gardeners would have reported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy.
Sibyl Vane's brother had not come back to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had sailed away
in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ship to founder in some winter sea. From him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), at any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was safe. Why, the man did not know who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, could not know who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was. The mask of youth had saved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think
that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them
visible form, and make them move before one! What sort of life would
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be if, day and night, shadows of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crime were to peer at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from
silent corners, to mock him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from secret places, to whisper in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ear
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat at the feast, to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with icy fingers as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay asleep!
As the thought crept through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew pale with terror, and
the air seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have become suddenly colder. Oh! in what a
wild hour of madness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had killed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend! How ghastly the mere
memory of the scene! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw it all again. Each hideous detail came
back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible
and swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sin. When Lord Henry
came in at six o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) crying as one whose heart will
break.

<p/>It was not till the third day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ventured to go out. There was
something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that
seemed to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) joyousness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ardour for life. But
it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had
caused the change. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own nature had revolted against the excess of
anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm.
With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so. Their
strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man,
or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The
loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude.
Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had convinced himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been the victim of a
terror-stricken imagination, and looked back now on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fears with
something of pity and not a little of contempt.

<p/>After breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden
and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp
frost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an inverted cup of
blue metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.

<p/>At the corner of the pine-wood he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught sight of Sir Geoffrey
Clouston, the duchess's brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clouston</b></font>) gun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clouston</b></font>) jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take
the mare home, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Clouston</b></font>) way towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Clouston</b></font>) guest through the withered
bracken and rough undergrowth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clouston</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the
open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new
ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian strolled along by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) side. The keen aromatic air, the brown
and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the
beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns
that followed, fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) and filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) with a sense of delightful
freedom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the
high indifference of joy.

<p/>Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front
of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it
forward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir
Geoffrey put his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) gun to his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) shoulder, but there was something in the
animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
cried out at once, <div class="bookquote">``Don't shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense, Dorian!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>laughed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) companion, and as the hare bounded
into the thicket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a
hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is
worse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! I have hit a beater!''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Clouston</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. <div class="bookquote">``What an
ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)
called out at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``A man is hurt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where, sir? Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) shouted. At the same time, the firing
ceased along the line.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geoffrey/Geoffrey Clouston</b></font>)</div>answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.
<div class="bookquote">``Why on earth don't you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for
the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the
lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging
a body after them into the sunlight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) turned away in horror. It
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that misfortune followed wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heard Sir
Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of
the keeper. The wood seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) to have become suddenly alive with
faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of
voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the
boughs overhead.

<p/>After a few moments--that were to him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) perturbed state, like
endless hours of pain--he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) felt a hand laid on his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) started
and looked round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, <div class="bookquote">``I had better tell them that the shooting is
stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``The
whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could not finish the sentence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>rejoined Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got the whole charge of
shot in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have died almost instantaneously. Come;
let us go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly
fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and
said, with a heavy sigh, <div class="bookquote">``It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! this accident, I suppose. My dear
fellow, it can't be helped. It was the man's own fault. Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
get in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather
awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper beaters. It
makes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>)
shoots very straight. But there is no use talking about the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if
something horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself,
perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) added, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) eyes, with a gesture of
pain.

<p/>The elder man laughed. <div class="bookquote">``The only horrible thing in the world is _ennui_,
Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness. But we
are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering
about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the subject is to be
tabooed. As for omens, there is no such thing as an omen. Destiny
does not send us heralds. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is too wise or too cruel for that.
Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian? You have
everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would
not be delighted to change places with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don't
laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant who
has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It
is the coming of death that terrifies me. Its monstrous wings seem to
wheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! don't you see a man
moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand
was pointing. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I see the gardener waiting for
you. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on
the table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You
must come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) saw the gardener approaching. The
man touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating
manner, and then produced a letter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) handed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) master.
<div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) Grace told me to wait for an answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>Dorian put the letter into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) Grace that I am
coming in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly in
the direction of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How fond women are of doing dangerous things!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>laughed Lord Henry.
<div class="bookquote">``It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will
flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present
instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I
don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the duchess loves you very much, but she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) likes you less, so you
are excellently matched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for
scandal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry,
lighting a cigarette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The world goes to the altar of its own accord,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the
desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has
become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It
was silly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a wire
to Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On a yacht one is safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me
what it is? You know I would help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered sadly. <div class="bookquote">``And I dare say it is
only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have
a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it is, but I can't help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess,
looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we have come back,
Duchess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Geoffrey is
terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) not to shoot the hare.
How curious!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was very curious. I don't know what made me say it. Some
whim, I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I
am sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an annoying subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>broke in Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``It has no
psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on
purpose, how interesting he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) would be! I should like to know some one
who had committed a real murder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How horrid of you, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>cried the duchess. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it, Mr. Gray?
Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is going to faint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``It is nothing,
Duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured; <div class="bookquote">``my nerves are dreadfully out of order. That is
all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn't hear what
Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I
think I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the
conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind
Dorian, Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) slumberous
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Are you very much in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish I knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) said at last.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty
that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One may lose one's way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Disillusion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my _debut_ in life,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It came to you crowned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am tired of strawberry leaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They become you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only in public.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would miss them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not part with a petal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monmouth has ears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Old age is dull of hearing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never been jealous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) glanced about as if in search of something. <div class="bookquote">``What are you looking
for?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The button from your foil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``You have dropped it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I have still the mask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes your eyes lovelier,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) reply.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) laughed again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet
fruit.

<p/>Upstairs, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror
in every tingling fibre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) body. Life had suddenly become too
hideous a burden for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to bear. The dreadful death of the unlucky
beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to
pre-figure death for himself also. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had nearly swooned at what Lord
Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.

<p/>At five o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rang his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bell for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) servant and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) orders to
pack his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham
at the door by eight-thirty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was determined not to sleep another
night at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened place. Death walked there
in the sunlight. The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Royal</b></font>) wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was going up to
town to consult his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) doctor and asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to entertain his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) guests in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) absence. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to
the door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) valet informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that the head-keeper wished to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) frowned and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``Send him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) muttered, after
some moments' hesitation.

<p/>As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) chequebook out of a
drawer and spread it out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this
morning, Thornton?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said, taking up a pen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gamekeeper</b></font>)</div>answered the gamekeeper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was the poor fellow married? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) any people dependent on him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>asked Dorian, looking bored. <div class="bookquote">``If so, I should not like them to be left
in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't know who he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of
coming to you about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know who he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, listlessly. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?
Wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) one of your men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. Never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) before. Seems like a sailor, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) heart
had suddenly stopped beating. <div class="bookquote">``A sailor?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cried out. <div class="bookquote">``Did you say
a sailor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on
both arms, and that kind of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was there anything found on him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, leaning forward and
looking at the man with startled eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Anything that would tell his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)
name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some money, sir--not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any
kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian started to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
clutched at it madly. <div class="bookquote">``Where is the body?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Quick! I
must see it at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don't like
to have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse brings
bad luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms
to bring my horse round. No. Never mind. I'll go to the stables
myself. It will save time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the
long avenue as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) could go. The trees seemed to sweep past him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
path. Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lashed her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) across the neck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) crop. She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) cleft the dusky air
like an arrow. The stones flew from her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hoofs.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the yard.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the
farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)
that the body was there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hurried to the door and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand
upon the latch.

<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) paused for a moment, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was on the brink of a
discovery that would either make or mar his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) life. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) thrust the
door open and entered.

<p/>On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man
dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted
handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse candle, stuck in
a bottle, sputtered beside it.

<p/>Dorian Gray shuddered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) could not be the hand to take
the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to
come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) said, clutching
at the door-post for support.

<p/>When the farm-servant had done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stepped forward. A cry of joy
broke from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket was
James Vane.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) rode
home, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) eyes were full of tears, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was safe.



<p/>CHAPTER 19

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried
Lord Henry, dipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) white fingers into a red copper bowl filled
with rose-water. <div class="bookquote">``You are quite perfect. Pray, don't change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian Gray shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful
things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began my good
actions yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where were you yesterday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``anybody can be good in the
country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why
people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized.
Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are
only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the
other by being corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being
either, so they stagnate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Culture and corruption,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>echoed Dorian. <div class="bookquote">``I have known something of
both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found
together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I
think I have altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say
you had done more than one?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) companion as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) spilled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a
perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one
else. I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I
mean. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I
think it was that which first attracted me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>). You remember Sibyl,
don't you? How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our
own class, of course. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was simply a girl in a village. But I
really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). I am quite sure that I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). All during this
wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
two or three times a week. Yesterday she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) met me in a little orchard.
The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was
laughing. We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn.
Suddenly I determined to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as flowerlike as I had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill
of real pleasure, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``But I can finish
your idyll for you. You gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) good advice and broke her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart.
That was the beginning of your reformation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, you are horrible! You mustn't say these dreadful things.
Hetty's heart is not broken. Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cried and all that. But
there is no disgrace upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) can live, like Perdita, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
garden of mint and marigold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And weep over a faithless Florizel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, laughing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously
boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now
with any one of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own rank? I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will be married some day
to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of having
met you, and loved you, will teach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to despise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
will be wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I
think much of your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is
poor. Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn't floating at the
present moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), like Ophelia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest
the most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don't care
what you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor
Hetty! As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) white face at
the window, like a spray of jasmine. Don't let us talk about it any
more, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have
done for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever
known, is really a sort of sin. I want to be better. I am going to be
better. Tell me something about yourself. What is going on in town?
I have not been to the club for days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The people are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said
Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and
the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having
more than one topic every three months. They have been very fortunate
lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell's
suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.
Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left
for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor
Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris
at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) has
been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who
disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a
delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think has happened to Basil?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>asked Dorian, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) could
discuss the matter so calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it
is no business of mine. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) is dead, I don't want to think about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the younger man wearily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, passing beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nostrils the gilt
trellis of an open vinaigrette box, <div class="bookquote">``one can survive everything
nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in
the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our
coffee in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man
with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria!
I was very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The house is rather lonely without her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Of
course, married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then one
regrets the loss even of one's worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them
the most. They are such an essential part of one's personality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next
room, sat down to the piano and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) fingers stray across the white
and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, <div class="bookquote">``Harry, did it ever
occur to you that Basil was murdered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Henry yawned. <div class="bookquote">``Basil was very popular, and always wore a
Waterbury watch. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) have been murdered? He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was not clever
enough to have enemies. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had a wonderful genius for
painting. But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as
possible. Basil was really rather dull. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) only interested me once,
and that was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) told me, years ago, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had a wild adoration
for you and that you were the dominant motive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very fond of Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian with a note of sadness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
voice. <div class="bookquote">``But don't people say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was murdered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all
probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not
the sort of man to have gone to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had no curiosity. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)
chief defect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the younger man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intently after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that
doesn't suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.
It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt
your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs
exclusively to the lower orders. I don't blame them in the smallest
degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us,
simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who
has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?
Don't tell me that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord
Henry, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``That is one of the most important secrets of life.
I should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should
never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us
pass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had come to such
a really romantic end as you suggest, but I can't. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) fell
into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the
scandal. Yes: I should fancy that was his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) end. I see him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) lying now
on his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges
floating over him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) and long weeds catching in his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) hair. Do you know, I
don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) would have done much more good work. During the last
ten years his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) painting had gone off very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began
to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged
bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo
perch. As his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf
of crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards
and forwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) continued, turning round and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) handkerchief out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pocket; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me to have
lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) ceased to be
great friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) ceased to be a great artist. What was it separated
you? I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) bored you. If so, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) never forgave you. It's a
habit bores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful
portrait he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) did of you? I don't think I have ever seen it since he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>)
finished it. Oh! I remember your telling me years ago that you had
sent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the
way. You never got it back? What a pity! it was really a
masterpiece. I remember I wanted to buy it. I wish I had now. It
belonged to Basil's best period. Since then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) work was that curious
mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man
to be called a representative British artist. Did you advertise for
it? You should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian. ``I suppose I did. But I never really liked
it. I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to
me. Why do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious
lines in some play--Hamlet, I think--how do they run?--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes: that is what it was like.''

<p/>Lord Henry laughed. <div class="bookquote">``If a man treats life artistically, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain is
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered, sinking into an arm-chair.

<p/>Dorian Gray shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head and struck some soft chords on the piano.
<div class="bookquote">''`Like the painting of a sorrow,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">'''a face without a
heart.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The elder man lay back and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with half-closed eyes. <div class="bookquote">``By
the way, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said after a pause, <div class="bookquote">''`what does it profit a man if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gain the whole world and lose--how does the quotation run?--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
soul'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) friend.
<div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask me that, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, elevating his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyebrows in surprise,
<div class="bookquote">``I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.
That is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by
the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people
listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the
man yelling out that question to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) audience. It struck me as being
rather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind.
A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly
white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful
phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips--it was really very
good in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet
that art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would not have understood me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and
sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There
is a soul in each one of us. I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely
certain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the
lesson of romance. How grave you are! Don't be so serious. What have
you or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given
up our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne,
Dorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept
your youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than
you are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really
wonderful, Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do
to-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather
cheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of
course, but not in appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret.
To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take
exercise, get up early, or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing
like it. It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only
people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much
younger than myself. They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to
them her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) latest wonder. As for the aged, I always contradict the aged.
I do it on principle. If you ask them their opinion on something that
happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in
1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew
absolutely nothing. How lovely that thing you are playing is! I
wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round the
villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes? It is marvellously
romantic. What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that
is not imitative! Don't stop. I want music to-night. It seems to me
that you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you.
I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know nothing of. The
tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young. I am
amazed sometimes at my own sincerity. Ah, Dorian, how happy you are!
What an exquisite life you have had! You have drunk deeply of
everything. You have crushed the grapes against your palate. Nothing
has been hidden from you. And it has all been to you no more than the
sound of music. It has not marred you. You are still the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not the same, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be.
Don't spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.
Don't make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need
not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don't deceive
yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a
question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which
thought hides itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy
yourself safe and think yourself strong. But a chance tone of colour
in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once
loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten
poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music
that you had ceased to play--I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things
like these that our lives depend. Browning writes about that
somewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us. There are
moments when the odour of _lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I
have to live the strangest month of my life over again. I wish I could
change places with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us
both, but it has always worshipped you. It always will worship you.
You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is
afraid it has found. I am so glad that you have never done anything,
never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything
outside of yourself! Life has been your art. You have set yourself to
music. Your days are your sonnets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand through his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hair.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, life has been exquisite,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``but I am not going to
have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant
things to me. You don't know everything about me. I think that if you
did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don't laugh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the
nocturne over again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that
hangs in the dusky air. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) is waiting for you to charm her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), and if
you play she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) will come closer to the earth. You won't? Let us go to
the club, then. It has been a charming evening, and we must end it
charmingly. There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know
you--young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has already copied
your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is quite
delightful and rather reminds me of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian with a sad look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``But I am tired
to-night, Harry. I shan't go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I
want to go to bed early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was
something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression
than I had ever heard from it before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because I am going to be good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I am a
little changed already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot change to me, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``You and I will
always be friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.
Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It
does harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be
going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people
against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too
delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we
are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,
there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It
annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that
the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.
That is all. But we won't discuss literature. Come round to-morrow. I
am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take you
to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is a charming woman, and
wants to consult you about some tapestries she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is thinking of buying.
Mind you come. Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) says
she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought
you would be. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) clever tongue gets on one's nerves. Well, in any
case, be here at eleven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I really come, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don't think there have
been such lilacs since the year I met you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I shall be here at eleven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian. <div class="bookquote">``Good night,
Harry.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) reached the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hesitated for a moment, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
had something more to say. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) sighed and went out.



<p/>CHAPTER 20

<p/>It was a lovely night, so warm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) coat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) arm and
did not even put his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) silk scarf round his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) throat. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) strolled home,
smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
heard one of them whisper to the other, <div class="bookquote">``That is Dorian Gray.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>)
remembered how pleased he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) used to be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was pointed out, or stared
at, or talked about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was tired of hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own name now. Half
the charm of the little village where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had been so often lately was
that no one knew who he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had often told the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had
lured to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was poor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had
told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was wicked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) and
answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a
laugh she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had!--just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
been in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cotton dresses and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) large hats! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew nothing, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had lost.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) reached home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) servant waiting up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and
began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).

<p/>Was it really true that one could never change? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt a wild longing
for the unstained purity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) boyhood--his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rose-white boyhood, as
Lord Henry had once called it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had tarnished himself,
filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mind with corruption and given horror to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fancy; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible
joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own, it had
been the fairest and the most full of promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had brought to
shame. But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)?

<p/>Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had prayed that
the portrait should bear the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) days, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) keep the
unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) failure had been due to
that. Better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that each sin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life had brought its sure
swift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.
Not <div class="bookquote">``Forgive us our sins''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>but <div class="bookquote">``Smite us for our iniquities''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>should be
the prayer of man to a most just God.

<p/>The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), so many
years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids
laughed round it as of old. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) took it up, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had done on that
night of horror when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had first noted the change in the fatal
picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished
shield. Once, some one who had terribly loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) a
mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: <div class="bookquote">``The world is changed
because you are made of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips
rewrite history.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The phrases came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) memory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) repeated
them over and over to himself. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) loathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own beauty, and
flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters
beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heel. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) beauty that had ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) beauty
and the youth that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had prayed for. But for those two things, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
life might have been free from stain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) beauty had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) but a
mask, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) youth but a mockery. What was youth at best? A green, an
unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
worn its livery? Youth had spoiled him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).

<p/>It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It
was of himself, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own future, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had to think. James
Vane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell
had shot himself one night in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) laboratory, but had not revealed the
secret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it
was, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away. It was
already waning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the
death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) mind. It was the
living death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own soul that troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). Basil had painted the
portrait that had marred his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) could not forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) that. It
was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) that were unbearable, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had yet borne with patience. The
murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) suicide had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) own act. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had chosen to do it. It was
nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).

<p/>A new life! That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) wanted. That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was waiting
for. Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had begun it already. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had spared one innocent
thing, at any rate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would never again tempt innocence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would be
good.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) thought of Hetty Merton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) began to wonder if the portrait in
the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it
had been? Perhaps if his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) life became pure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would be able to expel
every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil
had already gone away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would go and look.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) unbarred the
door, a smile of joy flitted across his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) strangely young-looking face
and lingered for a moment about his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) lips. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would be good, and
the hideous thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had hidden away would no longer be a terror
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) felt as if the load had been lifted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) already.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) went in quietly, locking the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>), as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) custom, and
dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and
indignation broke from him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) could see no change, save that in the
eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of
the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome--more loathsome, if
possible, than before--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed
brighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) trembled. Had it
been merely vanity that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) do his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) one good deed? Or the
desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mocking
laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things
finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the
red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a
horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the
painted feet, as though the thing had dripped--blood even on the hand
that had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was to
confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt
that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did confess, who
would believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.
Everything belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been destroyed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself had burned
what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was mad.
They would shut him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story... Yet it was
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public
atonement. There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to
earth as well as to heaven. Nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could do would cleanse him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
till he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own sin. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sin? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shoulders.
The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was thinking
of Hetty Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul
that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there
been nothing more in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) renunciation than that? There had been
something more. At least he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought so. But who could tell? ... No.
There had been nothing more. Through vanity he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Merton</b></font>). In
hypocrisy he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
had tried the denial of self. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) recognized that now.

<p/>But this murder--was it to dog him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) always to be
burdened by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) past? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) really to confess? Never. There was
only one bit of evidence left against him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). The picture itself--that
was evidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would destroy it. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kept it so long? Once
it had given him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of
late he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had felt no such pleasure. It had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) awake at night.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been away, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been filled with terror lest other eyes
should look upon it. It had brought melancholy across his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) passions.
Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy. It had been like
conscience to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Yes, it had been conscience. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would destroy it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)
had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It
was bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would
kill the painter's work, and all that that meant. It would kill the
past, and when that was dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would be free. It would kill this
monstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would be at
peace. He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.

<p/>There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its
agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.
Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked
up at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was
no answer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was
all dark. After a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went away and stood in an adjoining portico
and watched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose house is that, Constable?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>asked the elder of the two gentlemen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>answered the policeman.

<p/>They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of
them was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.

<p/>Inside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad domestics
were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying
and wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>) hands. Francis was as pale as death.

<p/>After about a quarter of an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) got the coachman and one of the
footmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply.
They called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying
to force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the
balcony. The windows yielded easily--their bolts were old.

<p/>When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait
of their master as they had last seen him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), in all the wonder of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in
evening dress, with a knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was withered, wrinkled,
and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings
that they recognized who it was.
