<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for
women, and become servants for their sakes. Many also
have perished, have erred, and sinned, for women... O
ye men, how can it be but women should be strong, seeing
they do thus?'' (<font color='red'><b>Thomas Hardy</b></font>)</div>--ESDRAS.


<p/>I


<p/>The schoolmaster was leaving the village, and everybody seemed sorry.
The miller at Cresscombe lent him (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) the small white tilted cart and
horse to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) goods to the city of his (<font color='blue'><b>miller</b></font>) destination, about twenty
miles off, such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the
departing teacher's effects. For the schoolhouse had been partly
furnished by the managers, and the only cumbersome article possessed
by the master, in addition to the packing-case of books, was a
cottage piano that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had bought at an auction during the year in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) thought of learning instrumental music. But the enthusiasm
having waned he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had never acquired any skill in playing, and the
purchased article had been a perpetual trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ever since in
moving house.

<p/>The rector had gone away for the day, being a man who disliked the
sight of changes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not mean to return till the evening, when
the new school-teacher would have arrived and settled in, and
everything would be smooth again.

<p/>The blacksmith, the farm bailiff, and the schoolmaster himself were
standing in perplexed attitudes in the parlour before the instrument.
The master had remarked that even if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) got it into the cart he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
should not know what to do with it on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) arrival at Christminster,
the city he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was bound for, since he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was only going into temporary
lodgings just at first.

<p/>A little boy of eleven, who had been thoughtfully assisting in the
packing, joined the group of men, and as they rubbed their chins he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
spoke up, blushing at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own voice: <div class="bookquote">``Aunt have got a
great fuel-house, and it could be put there, perhaps, till you've
found a place to settle in, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A proper good notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>the blacksmith</b></font>)</div>said the blacksmith.

<p/>It was decided that a deputation should wait on the boy's aunt--an
old maiden resident--and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would house the piano till
Mr. Phillotson should send for it. The smith and the bailiff started
to see about the practicability of the suggested shelter, and the boy
and the schoolmaster were left standing alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry I am going, Jude?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the latter kindly.

<p/>Tears rose into the boy's eyes, for he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was not among the regular day
scholars, who came unromantically close to the schoolmaster's life,
but one who had attended the night school only during the present
teacher's term of office. The regular scholars, if the truth must
be told, stood at the present moment afar off, like certain historic
disciples, indisposed to any enthusiastic volunteering of aid.

<p/>The boy awkwardly opened the book he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand, which Mr.
Phillotson had bestowed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) as a parting gift, and admitted that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was sorry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Phillotson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you go, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--that would be a long story. You wouldn't understand my reasons,
Jude. You will, perhaps, when you are older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I should now, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--don't speak of this everywhere. You know what a university
is, and a university degree? It is the necessary hallmark of a man
who wants to do anything in teaching. My scheme, or dream, is to be
a university graduate, and then to be ordained. By going to live at
Christminster, or near it, I shall be at headquarters, so to speak,
and if my scheme is practicable at all, I consider that being on the
spot will afford me a better chance of carrying it out than I should
have elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The smith</b></font>)</div><p/>The smith and his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) companion returned. Old Miss Fawley's fuel-house
was dry, and eminently practicable; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) seemed willing to give
the instrument standing-room there. It was accordingly left in
the school till the evening, when more hands would be available for
removing it; and the schoolmaster gave a final glance round.

<p/>The boy Jude assisted in loading some small articles, and at nine
o'clock Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) box of books and other
_impedimenta_, and bade his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friends good-bye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't forget you, Jude,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said, smiling, as the cart moved off.
<div class="bookquote">``Be a good boy, remember; and be kind to animals and birds, and read
all you can. And if ever you come to Christminster remember you hunt
me out for old acquaintance' sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The cart creaked across the green, and disappeared round the corner
by the rectory-house. The boy returned to the draw-well at the edge
of the greensward, where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) buckets when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went to help
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) patron and teacher in the loading. There was a quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lip
now and after opening the well-cover to begin lowering the bucket he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
paused and leant with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forehead and arms against the framework,
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face wearing the fixity of a thoughtful child's who has felt the
pricks of life somewhat before his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) time. The well into which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
looking was as ancient as the village itself, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) present
position appeared as a long circular perspective ending in a shining
disk of quivering water at a distance of a hundred feet down.
There was a lining of green moss near the top, and nearer still the
hart's-tongue fern.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said to himself, in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy,
that the schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a
morning like this, and would never draw there any more. <div class="bookquote">``I've seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) look down into it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was tired with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) drawing, just as I
do now, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) rested a bit before carrying the buckets home!
But he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was too clever to bide here any longer--a small sleepy place
like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A tear rolled from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eye into the depths of the well. The morning
was a little foggy, and the boy's breathing unfurled itself as
a thicker fog upon the still and heavy air. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thoughts were
interrupted by a sudden outcry:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring on that water, will ye, you idle young harlican!''

 (<font color='red'><b>an woman</b></font>)</div><p/>It came from an old woman who had emerged from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) door towards the
garden gate of a green-thatched cottage not far off. The boy quickly
waved a signal of assent, drew the water with what was a great effort
for one of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stature, landed and emptied the big bucket into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
own pair of smaller ones, and pausing a moment for breath, started
with them across the patch of clammy greensward whereon the well
stood--nearly in the centre of the little village, or rather hamlet
of Marygreen.

<p/>It was as old-fashioned as it was small, and it rested in the lap of
an undulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs. Old as it
was, however, the well-shaft was probably the only relic of the local
history that remained absolutely unchanged. Many of the thatched
and dormered dwelling-houses had been pulled down of late years, and
many trees felled on the green. Above all, the original church,
hump-backed, wood-turreted, and quaintly hipped, had been taken
down, and either cracked up into heaps of road-metal in the lane, or
utilized as pig-sty walls, garden seats, guard-stones to fences, and
rockeries in the flower-beds of the neighbourhood. In place of it
a tall new building of modern Gothic design, unfamiliar to English
eyes, had been erected on a new piece of ground by a certain
obliterator of historic records who had run down from London and back
in a day. The site whereon so long had stood the ancient temple to
the Christian divinities was not even recorded on the green and level
grass-plot that had immemorially been the churchyard, the obliterated
graves being commemorated by eighteen-penny cast-iron crosses
warranted to last five years.



<p/>II


<p/>Slender as was Jude Fawley's frame he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) bore the two brimming
house-buckets of water to the cottage without resting. Over the door
was a little rectangular piece of blue board, on which was painted
in yellow letters, <div class="bookquote">``Drusilla Fawley, Baker.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Within the little lead
panes of the window--this being one of the few old houses left--were
five bottles of sweets, and three buns on a plate of the willow
pattern.

<p/>While emptying the buckets at the back of the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) could hear an
animated conversation in progress within-doors between his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) great-aunt,
the Drusilla of the sign-board, and some other villagers. Having
seen the school-master depart, they were summing up particulars of
the event, and indulging in predictions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) future.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who's he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>a stranger</b></font>)</div>asked one, comparatively a stranger, when the boy
entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well ye med ask it, Mrs. Williams. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>)'s my great-nephew--come since
you was last this way.''  (<font color='red'><b>The inhabitant</b></font>)</div>The old inhabitant who answered was a tall,
gaunt woman, who spoke tragically on the most trivial subject, and
gave a phrase of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conversation to each auditor in turn. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) come
from Mellstock, down in South Wessex, about a year ago--worse luck
for `n, Belinda''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning to the right-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``where his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) father was living,
and was took wi' the shakings for death, and died in two days, as you
know, Caroline''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning to the left-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``It would ha' been a blessing
if Goddy-mighty had took thee too, wi' thy mother and father, poor
useless boy! But I've got him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) here to stay with me till I can see
what's to be done with un, though I am obliged to let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) earn any
penny he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can. Just now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a-scaring of birds for Farmer Troutham.
It keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out of mischty. Why do ye turn away, Jude?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
continued, as the boy, feeling the impact of their glances like slaps
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face, moved aside.

<p/>The local washerwoman replied that it was perhaps a very good plan of
Miss or Mrs. Fawley's -LRB-as they called her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) indifferently-RRB- to have him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``to kip `ee company in your loneliness, fetch water, shet
the winder-shetters o' nights, and help in the bit o' baking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Fawley doubted it... <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't ye get the schoolmaster to
take `ee to Christminster wi' un, and make a scholar of `ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Fawley</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)
continued, in frowning pleasantry. ``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) couldn't ha' took a
better one. The boy is crazy for books, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is. It runs in our
family rather. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cousin Sue is just the same--so I've heard; but
I have not seen the child for years, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was born in this
place, within these four walls, as it happened. My niece and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
husband, after they were married, didn' get a house of their own for
some year or more; and then they only had one till--Well, I won't go
into that. Jude, my child, don't you ever marry. <div class="bookquote">``Tisn't for the
Fawleys to take that step any more. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), their only one, was like
a child o' my own, Belinda, till the split come! Ah, that a little
maid should know such changes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude, finding the general attention again centering on himself, went
out to the bakehouse, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ate the cake provided for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
breakfast. The end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) spare time had now arrived, and emerging
from the garden by getting over the hedge at the back he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pursued a
path northward, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) came to a wide and lonely depression in the
general level of the upland, which was sown as a corn-field. This
vast concave was the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) labours for Mr Troutham the farmer,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) descended into the midst of it.

<p/>The brown surface of the field went right up towards the sky all
round, where it was lost by degrees in the mist that shut out the
actual verge and accentuated the solitude. The only marks on the
uniformity of the scene were a rick of last year's produce standing
in the midst of the arable, the rooks that rose at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) approach, and
the path athwart the fallow by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had come, trodden now by he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
hardly knew whom, though once by many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own dead family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How ugly it is here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>The fresh harrow-lines seemed to stretch like the channellings in
a piece of new corduroy, lending a meanly utilitarian air to the
expanse, taking away its gradations, and depriving it of all history
beyond that of the few recent months, though to every clod and stone
there really attached associations enough and to spare--echoes of
songs from ancient harvest-days, of spoken words, and of sturdy
deeds. Every inch of ground had been the site, first or last,
of energy, gaiety, horse-play, bickerings, weariness. Groups of
gleaners had squatted in the sun on every square yard. Love-matches
that had populated the adjoining hamlet had been made up there
between reaping and carrying. Under the hedge which divided the
field from a distant plantation girls had given themselves to lovers
who would not turn their heads to look at them by the next harvest;
and in that ancient cornfield many a man had made love-promises to
a woman at whose voice he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had trembled by the next seed-time after
fulfilling them in the church adjoining. But this neither Jude nor
the rooks around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) considered. For them it was a lonely place,
possessing, in the one view, only the quality of a work-ground, and
in the other that of a granary good to feed in.

<p/>The boy stood under the rick before mentioned, and every few seconds
used his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clacker or rattle briskly. At each clack the rooks left off
pecking, and rose and went away on their leisurely wings, burnished
like tassets of mail, afterwards wheeling back and regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
warily, and descending to feed at a more respectful distance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sounded the clacker till his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm ached, and at length his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart
grew sympathetic with the birds' thwarted desires. They seemed, like
himself, to be living in a world which did not want them. Why should
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) frighten them away? They took upon more and more the aspect of
gentle friends and pensioners--the only friends he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could claim as
being in the least degree interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aunt had often
told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was not. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ceased his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rattling, and they alighted
anew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little dears!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, aloud. <div class="bookquote">``You SHALL have some dinner--
you shall. There is enough for us all. Farmer Troutham can afford
to let you have some. Eat, then my dear little birdies, and make a
good meal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>They stayed and ate, inky spots on the nut-brown soil, and Jude
enjoyed their appetite. A magic thread of fellow-feeling united his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
own life with theirs. Puny and sorry as those lives were, they much
resembled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) clacker he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had by this time thrown away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), as being a mean
and sordid instrument, offensive both to the birds and to himself
as their friend. All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) became conscious of a smart blow
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) buttocks, followed by a loud clack, which announced to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
surprised senses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence
used. The birds and Jude started up simultaneously, and the dazed
eyes of the latter beheld the farmer in person, the great Troutham
himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) red face glaring down upon Jude's cowering frame, the
clacker swinging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand.

<p/>``So it's ``Eat my dear birdies,'' is it, young man? ``Eat, dear
birdies,'' indeed! I'll tickle your breeches, and see if you say,
``Eat, dear birdies,<div class="bookquote">'' again in a hurry! And you've been idling at the
schoolmaster's too, instead of coming here, ha'n't ye, hey? That's
how you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst saluting Jude's ears with this impassioned rhetoric, Troutham
had seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) left hand with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own left, and swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) slim
frame round him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at arm's-length, again struck Jude on the hind parts
with the flat side of Jude's own rattle, till the field echoed with
the blows, which were delivered once or twice at each revolution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't `ee, sir--please don't `ee!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>cried the whirling child, as
helpless under the centrifugal tendency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) person as a hooked
fish swinging to land, and beholding the hill, the rick, the
plantation, the path, and the rooks going round and round him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in an
amazing circular race. <div class="bookquote">``I--I sir--only meant that--there was a good
crop in the ground--I saw 'em sow it--and the rooks could have a
little bit for dinner--and you wouldn't miss it, sir--and Mr.
Phillotson said I was to be kind to 'em--oh, oh, oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>This truthful explanation seemed to exasperate the farmer even more
than if Jude had stoutly denied saying anything at all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) still
smacked the whirling urchin, the clacks of the instrument continuing
to resound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant
workers--who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) business
of clacking with great assiduity--and echoing from the brand-new
church tower just behind the mist, towards the building of which
structure the farmer had largely subscribed, to testify his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) love for
God and man.

<p/>Presently Troutham grew tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) punitive task, and depositing
the quivering boy on his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) legs, took a sixpence from his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) pocket and
gave it him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) in payment for his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) day's work, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) to go home and
never let him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) in one of those fields again.

<p/>Jude leaped out of arm's reach, and walked along the trackway
weeping--not from the pain, though that was keen enough; not from the
perception of the flaw in the terrestrial scheme, by which what was
good for God's birds was bad for God's gardener; but with the awful
sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had wholly disgraced himself before he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been a year
in the parish, and hence might be a burden to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) great-aunt for
life.

<p/>With this shadow on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not care to show himself in the
village, and went homeward by a roundabout track behind a high hedge
and across a pasture. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) beheld scores of coupled earthworms
lying half their length on the surface of the damp ground, as
they always did in such weather at that time of the year. It was
impossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them
at each tread.

<p/>Though Farmer Troutham had just hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) was a boy who could not
himself bear to hurt anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) had never brought home a nest of
young birds without lying awake in misery half the night after, and
often reinstating them and the nest in their original place the next
morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) could scarcely bear to see trees cut down or lopped,
from a fancy that it hurt them; and late pruning, when the sap was up
and the tree bled profusely, had been a positive grief to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>)
infancy. This weakness of character, as it may be called, suggested
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) was the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before
the fall of the curtain upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) unnecessary life should signify that
all was well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) carefully picked his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) way on tiptoe
among the earthworms, without killing a single one.

<p/>On entering the cottage he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) aunt selling a penny loaf to a
little girl, and when the customer was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, how do
you come to be back here in the middle of the morning like this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm turned away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Troutham have turned me away because I let the rooks have a few
peckings of corn. And there's my wages--the last I shall ever hae!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) threw the sixpence tragically on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) aunt, suspending her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) breath. And she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) opened upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>)
a lecture on how she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would now have him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) all the spring upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hands
doing nothing. ``If you can't skeer birds, what can ye do? There!
don't ye look so deedy! Farmer Troutham is not so much better than
myself, come to that. But `tis as Job said, ``Now they that are
younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have
disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.<div class="bookquote">'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) father was my
father's journeyman, anyhow, and I must have been a fool to let `ee
go to work for `n, which I shouldn't ha' done but to keep `ee out of
mischty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>More angry with Jude for demeaning her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) by coming there than for
dereliction of duty, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) rated him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) primarily from that point of view,
and only secondarily from a moral one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that you should have let the birds eat what Farmer Troutham
planted. Of course you was wrong in that. Jude, Jude, why didstn't
go off with that schoolmaster of thine to Christminster or somewhere?
But, oh no--poor or`nary child--there never was any sprawl on thy
side of the family, and never will be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is this beautiful city, Aunt--this place where Mr. Phillotson
is gone to?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the boy, after meditating in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord! you ought to know where the city of Christminster is. Near a
score of miles from here. It is a place much too good for you ever
to have much to do with, poor boy, I'm a-thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will Mr. Phillotson always be there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I tell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could I go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, no! You didn't grow up hereabout, or you wouldn't ask such as
that. We've never had anything to do with folk in Christminster, nor
folk in Christminster with we.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude went out, and, feeling more than ever his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) existence to be an
undemanded one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lay down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) back on a heap of litter near
the pig-sty. The fog had by this time become more translucent, and
the position of the sun could be seen through it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
straw hat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face, and peered through the interstices of the
plaiting at the white brightness, vaguely reflecting. Growing up
brought responsibilities, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found. Events did not rhyme quite as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had thought. Nature's logic was too horrid for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to care for.
That mercy towards one set of creatures was cruelty towards another
sickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sense of harmony. As you got older, and felt yourself
to be at the centre of your time, and not at a point in its
circumference, as you had felt when you were little, you were seized
with a sort of shuddering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) perceived. All around you there seemed
to be something glaring, garish, rattling, and the noises and glares
hit upon the little cell called your life, and shook it, and warped
it.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could only prevent himself growing up! He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not want to be a
man.

<p/>Then, like the natural boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) despondency, and sprang up.
During the remainder of the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) helped his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aunt, and in the
afternoon, when there was nothing more to be done, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went into the
village. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked a man whereabouts Christminster lay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Christminster? Oh, well, out by there yonder; though I've never bin
there--not I. I've never had any business at such a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man pointed north-eastward, in the very direction where lay that
field in which Jude had so disgraced himself. There was something
unpleasant about the coincidence for the moment, but the fearsomeness
of this fact rather increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) curiosity about the city. The
farmer had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was never to be seen in that field again; yet
Christminster lay across it, and the path was a public one. So,
stealing out of the hamlet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) descended into the same hollow which
had witnessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) punishment in the morning, never swerving an inch
from the path, and climbing up the long and tedious ascent on the
other side till the track joined the highway by a little clump of
trees. Here the ploughed land ended, and all before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was bleak
open down.



<p/>III


<p/>Not a soul was visible on the hedgeless highway, or on either side of
it, and the white road seemed to ascend and diminish till it joined
the sky. At the very top it was crossed at right angles by a green
<div class="bookquote">``ridgeway'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--the Ickneild Street and original Roman road through the
district. This ancient track ran east and west for many miles, and
down almost to within living memory had been used for driving flocks
and herds to fairs and markets. But it was now neglected and
overgrown.

<p/>The boy had never before strayed so far north as this from the
nestling hamlet in which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been deposited by the carrier from a
railway station southward, one dark evening some few months earlier,
and till now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had had no suspicion that such a wide, flat,
low-lying country lay so near at hand, under the very verge of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
upland world. The whole northern semicircle between east and west,
to a distance of forty or fifty miles, spread itself before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); a
bluer, moister atmosphere, evidently, than that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breathed up here.

<p/>Not far from the road stood a weather-beaten old barn of reddish-grey
brick and tile. It was known as the Brown House by the people of the
locality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was about to pass it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) perceived a ladder against
the eaves; and the reflection that the higher he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) got, the further he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
could see, led Jude to stand and regard it. On the slope of the roof
two men were repairing the tiling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned into the ridgeway and
drew towards the barn.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had wistfully watched the workmen for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took
courage, and ascended the ladder till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stood beside them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my lad, and what may you want up here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to know where the city of Christminster is, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Christminster is out across there, by that clump. You can see
it--at least you can on a clear day. Ah, no, you can't now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The tiler</b></font>)</div><p/>The other tiler, glad of any kind of diversion from the monotony of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) labour, had also turned to look towards the quarter designated.
<div class="bookquote">``You can't often see it in weather like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The time
I've noticed it is when the sun is going down in a blaze of flame,
and it looks like--I don't know what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The heavenly Jerusalem,''  (<font color='red'><b>the urchin</b></font>)</div>suggested the serious urchin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay--though I should never ha' thought of it myself... But I can't
see no Christminster to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy strained his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes also; yet neither could he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) see the far-off
city. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) descended from the barn, and abandoning Christminster with
the versatility of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walked along the ridge-track, looking
for any natural objects of interest that might lie in the banks
thereabout. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) repassed the barn to go back to Marygreen he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
observed that the ladder was still in its place, but that the men had
finished their day's work and gone away.

<p/>It was waning towards evening; there was still a faint mist, but it
had cleared a little except in the damper tracts of subjacent country
and along the river-courses. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought again of Christminster, and
wished, since he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had come two or three miles from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aunt's house
on purpose, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could have seen for once this attractive city of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been told. But even if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) waited here it was hardly
likely that the air would clear before night. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was loth to
leave the spot, for the northern expanse became lost to view on
retreating towards the village only a few hundred yards.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ascended the ladder to have one more look at the point the men
had designated, and perched himself on the highest rung, overlying
the tiles. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might not be able to come so far as this for many
days. Perhaps if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prayed, the wish to see Christminster might be
forwarded. People said that, if you prayed, things sometimes came to
you, even though they sometimes did not. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had read in a tract that
a man who had begun to build a church, and had no money to finish
it, knelt down and prayed, and the money came in by the next post.
Another man tried the same experiment, and the money did not come;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found afterwards that the breeches he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knelt in were made by
a wicked Jew. This was not discouraging, and turning on the ladder
Jude knelt on the third rung, where, resting against those above it,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) prayed that the mist might rise.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) then seated himself again, and waited. In the course of ten or
fifteen minutes the thinning mist dissolved altogether from the
northern horizon, as it had already done elsewhere, and about a
quarter of an hour before the time of sunset the westward clouds
parted, the sun's position being partially uncovered, and the beams
streaming out in visible lines between two bars of slaty cloud. The
boy immediately looked back in the old direction.

<p/>Some way within the limits of the stretch of landscape, points of
light like the topaz gleamed. The air increased in transparency with
the lapse of minutes, till the topaz points showed themselves to be
the vanes, windows, wet roof slates, and other shining spots upon the
spires, domes, freestone-work, and varied outlines that were faintly
revealed. It was Christminster, unquestionably; either directly
seen, or miraged in the peculiar atmosphere.

<p/>The spectator gazed on and on till the windows and vanes lost their
shine, going out almost suddenly like extinguished candles. The
vague city became veiled in mist. Turning to the west, he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) saw that
the sun had disappeared. The foreground of the scene had grown
funereally dark, and near objects put on the hues and shapes of
chimaeras.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) anxiously descended the ladder, and started homewards at a run,
trying not to think of giants, Herne the Hunter, Apollyon lying in
wait for Christian, or of the captain with the bleeding hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
forehead and the corpses round him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) that remutinied every night on
board the bewitched ship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had grown out of belief in
these horrors, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was glad when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) saw the church tower and the
lights in the cottage windows, even though this was not the home of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) birth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) great-aunt did not care much about him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).



<p/>Inside and round about that old woman's <div class="bookquote">``shop''  (<font color='red'><b>that woman</b></font>)</div>window, with its
twenty-four little panes set in lead-work, the glass of some of
them oxidized with age, so that you could hardly see the poor penny
articles exhibited within, and forming part of a stock which a strong
man could have carried, Jude had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) outer being for some long
tideless time. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dreams were as gigantic as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) surroundings
were small.

<p/>Through the solid barrier of cold cretaceous upland to the northward
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was always beholding a gorgeous city--the fancied place he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
likened to the new Jerusalem, though there was perhaps more of the
painter's imagination and less of the diamond merchant's in his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)
dreams thereof than in those of the Apocalyptic writer. And the city
acquired a tangibility, a permanence, a hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) life, mainly from
the one nucleus of fact that the man for whose knowledge and purposes
he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) had so much reverence was actually living there; not only so, but
living among the more thoughtful and mentally shining ones therein.

<p/>In sad wet seasons, though he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) knew it must rain at Christminster too,
he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) could hardly believe that it rained so drearily there. Whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) could get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two,
which was not often, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) would steal off to the Brown House on the
hill and strain his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) eyes persistently; sometimes to be rewarded by
the sight of a dome or spire, at other times by a little smoke, which
in his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) estimate had some of the mysticism of incense.

<p/>Then the day came when it suddenly occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>)
ascended to the point of view after dark, or possibly went a mile or
two further, he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) would see the night lights of the city. It would be
necessary to come back alone, but even that consideration did not
deter him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) could throw a little manliness into his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) mood, no
doubt.

<p/>The project was duly executed. It was not late when he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) arrived at
the place of outlook, only just after dusk, but a black north-east
sky, accompanied by a wind from the same quarter, made the occasion
dark enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) was rewarded; but what he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) saw was not the lamps in
rows, as he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) had half expected. No individual light was visible, only
a halo or glow-fog over-arching the place against the black heavens
behind it, making the light and the city seem distant but a mile or
so.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) set himself to wonder on the exact point in the glow where the
schoolmaster might be--he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) who never communicated with anybody at
Marygreen now; who was as if dead to them here. In the glow he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>)
seemed to see Phillotson promenading at ease, like one of the forms
in Nebuchadnezzar's furnace.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) had heard that breezes travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour,
and the fact now came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) parted his (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) faced
the north-east, and drew in the wind as if it were a sweet liquor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) said, addressing the breeze caressingly <div class="bookquote">``were in
Christminster city between one and two hours ago, floating along the
streets, pulling round the weather-cocks, touching Mr. Phillotson's
face, being breathed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>); and now you are here, breathed by
me--you, the very same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly there came along this wind something towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>)--a message
from the place--from some soul residing there, it seemed. Surely it
was the sound of bells, the voice of the city, faint and musical,
calling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``We are happy here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) had become entirely lost to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) bodily situation during this
mental leap, and only got back to it by a rough recalling. A few
yards below the brow of the hill on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) paused a team of horses
made its appearance, having reached the place by dint of half an
hour's serpentine progress from the bottom of the immense declivity.
They had a load of coals behind them--a fuel that could only be got
into the upland by this particular route. They were accompanied by a
carter, a second man, and a boy, who now kicked a large stone behind
one of the wheels, and allowed the panting animals to have a long
rest, while those in charge took a flagon off the load and indulged
in a drink round.

<p/>They were elderly men, and had genial voices. Jude addressed them,
inquiring if they had come from Christminster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid, with this load!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said they.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The place I mean is that one yonder.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was getting so
romantically attached to Christminster that, like a young lover
alluding to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mistress, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) felt bashful at mentioning its name
again. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) pointed to the light in the sky--hardly perceptible to
their older eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. There do seem a spot a bit brighter in the nor'-east than
elsewhere, though I shouldn't ha' noticed it myself, and no doubt it
med be Christminster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Here a little book of tales which Jude had tucked up under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm,
having brought them to read on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) way hither before it grew dark,
slipped and fell into the road. The carter eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) picked
it up and straightened the leaves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) observed, <div class="bookquote">``you'd have to get your head screwed on
t`other way before you could read what they read there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they never look at anything that folks like we can understand,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the carter</b></font>)</div>the carter continued, by way of passing the time. ``On'y foreign
tongues used in the days of the Tower of Babel, when no two families
spoke alike. They read that sort of thing as fast as a night-hawk
will whir. <div class="bookquote">``Tis all learning there--nothing but learning, except
religion. And that's learning too, for I never could understand it.
Yes, `tis a serious-minded place. Not but there's wenches in the
streets o' nights... You know, I suppose, that they raise pa`sons
there like radishes in a bed? And though it do take--how many years,
Bob?--five years to turn a lirruping hobble-de-hoy chap into a solemn
preaching man with no corrupt passions, they'll do it, if it can be
done, and polish un off like the workmen they be, and turn un out wi'
a long face, and a long black coat and waistcoat, and a religious
collar and hat, same as they used to wear in the Scriptures, so that
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mother wouldn't know un sometimes... There, `tis their
business, like anybody else's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how should you know''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Now don't you interrupt, my boy. Never interrupt your senyers.
Move the fore hoss aside, Bobby; here's som`at coming... You must
mind that I be a-talking of the college life. <div class="bookquote">``Em lives on a lofty
level; there's no gainsaying it, though I myself med not think much
of 'em. As we be here in our bodies on this high ground, so be they
in their minds--noble-minded men enough, no doubt--some on 'em--able
to earn hundreds by thinking out loud. And some on 'em be strong
young fellows that can earn a`most as much in silver cups. As for
music, there's beautiful music everywhere in Christminster. You med
be religious, or you med not, but you can't help striking in your
homely note with the rest. And there's a street in the place--the
main street--that ha'n't another like it in the world. I should
think I did know a little about Christminster!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time the horses had recovered breath and bent to their
collars again. Jude, throwing a last adoring look at the distant
halo, turned and walked beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remarkably well-informed friend,
who had no objection to telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as they moved on more yet of
the city--its towers and halls and churches. The waggon turned
into a cross-road, whereupon Jude thanked the carter warmly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
information, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) only wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could talk half as well about
Christminster as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, `tis oonly what has come in my way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the carter</b></font>)</div>said the carter
unboastfully. <div class="bookquote">``I've never been there, no more than you; but I've
picked up the knowledge here and there, and you be welcome to it.
A-getting about the world as I do, and mixing with all classes of
society, one can't help hearing of things. A friend o' mine, that
used to clane the boots at the Crozier Hotel in Christminster when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crozier</b></font>)
was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crozier</b></font>) prime, why, I knowed un as well as my own brother in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crozier</b></font>)
later years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walk homeward alone, pondering so deeply that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) forgot to feel timid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) suddenly grew older. It had been the
yearning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heart to find something to anchor on, to cling
to--for some place which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could call admirable. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) find
that place in this city if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could get there? Would it be a spot in
which, without fear of farmers, or hindrance, or ridicule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could
watch and wait, and set himself to some mighty undertaking like the
men of old of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had heard? As the halo had been to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes
when gazing at it a quarter of an hour earlier, so was the spot
mentally to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dark way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a city of light,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The tree of knowledge grows there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) added a few steps further on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a place that teachers of men spring from and go to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is what you may call a castle, manned by scholarship and
religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After this figure he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was silent a long while, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would just suit me.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>IV


<p/>Walking somewhat slowly by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) concentration, the boy--an
ancient man in some phases of thought, much younger than his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) years
in others--was overtaken by a light-footed pedestrian, whom,
notwithstanding the gloom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could perceive to be wearing an
extraordinarily tall hat, a swallow-tailed coat, and a watch-chain
that danced madly and threw around scintillations of sky-light as
its owner swung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots.
Jude, beginning to feel lonely, endeavoured to keep up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my man! I'm in a hurry, so you'll have to walk pretty fast
if you keep alongside of me. Do you know who I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think. Physician Vilbert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--I'm known everywhere, I see! That comes of being a public
benefactor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Vilbert</b></font>)</div><p/>Vilbert was an itinerant quack-doctor, well known to the rustic
population, and absolutely unknown to anybody else, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), indeed,
took care to be, to avoid inconvenient investigations. Cottagers
formed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) only patients, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) Wessex-wide repute was among them
alone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) position was humbler and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) field more obscure than
those of the quacks with capital and an organized system of
advertising. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was, in fact, a survival. The distances he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
traversed on foot were enormous, and extended nearly the whole length
and breadth of Wessex. Jude had one day seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) selling a pot of
coloured lard to an old woman as a certain cure for a bad leg, the
woman arranging to pay a guinea, in instalments of a shilling a
fortnight, for the precious salve, which, according to the physician,
could only be obtained from a particular animal which grazed on
Mount Sinai, and was to be captured only at great risk to life and
limb. Jude, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) already had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) doubts about this gentleman's
medicines, felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to be unquestionably a travelled personage, and
one who might be a trustworthy source of information on matters not
strictly professional.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I s`pose you've been to Christminster, Physician?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have--many times,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the long thin man. <div class="bookquote">``That's one of my
centres.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a wonderful city for scholarship and religion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd say so, my boy, if you'd seen it. Why, the very sons of the
old women who do the washing of the colleges can talk in Latin--not
good Latin, that I admit, as a critic: dog-Latin--cat-Latin, as we
used to call it in my undergraduate days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Greek?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--that's more for the men who are in training for bishops, that
they may be able to read the New Testament in the original.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to learn Latin and Greek myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A lofty desire. You must get a grammar of each tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to go to Christminster some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever you do, you say that Physician Vilbert is the only
proprietor of those celebrated pills that infallibly cure all
disorders of the alimentary system, as well as asthma and shortness
of breath. Two and threepence a box--specially licensed by the
government stamp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll sell you mine with pleasure--those I used as a student.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude gratefully, but in gasps, for the
amazing speed of the physician's walk kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in a dog-trot which
was giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) a stitch in the side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you'd better drop behind, my young man. Now I'll tell you
what I'll do. I'll get you the grammars, and give you a first
lesson, if you'll remember, at every house in the village, to
recommend Physician Vilbert's golden ointment, life-drops, and female
pills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where will you be with the grammars?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be passing here this day fortnight at precisely this hour of
five-and-twenty minutes past seven. My movements are as truly timed
as those of the planets in their courses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I'll be to meet you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With orders for my medicines?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Physician.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude then dropped behind, waited a few minutes to recover breath,
and went home with a consciousness of having struck a blow for
Christminster.

<p/>Through the intervening fortnight he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ran about and smiled outwardly
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) inward thoughts, as if they were people meeting and nodding to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)--smiled with that singularly beautiful irradiation which is seen
to spread on young faces at the inception of some glorious idea, as
if a supernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures,
giving rise to the flattering fancy that heaven lies about them then.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) honestly performed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) promise to the man of many cures, in whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now sincerely believed, walking miles hither and thither among
the surrounding hamlets as the Physician's agent in advance. On the
evening appointed he (<font color='blue'><b>Physician</b></font>) stood motionless on the plateau, at the place
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Physician</b></font>) had parted from Vilbert, and there awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Physician</b></font>) approach.
The road-physician was fairly up to time; but, to the surprise of
Jude on striking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pace, which the pedestrian did not diminish
by a single unit of force, the latter seemed hardly to recognize his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
young companion, though with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings
had grown light. Jude thought it might perhaps be owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
wearing another hat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saluted the physician with dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the latter abstractedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You? who are you? Oh yes--to be sure! Got any orders, lad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>And Jude told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) the names and addresses of the cottagers
who were willing to test the virtues of the world-renowned pills and
salve. The quack mentally registered these with great care.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the Latin and Greek grammars?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude's voice trembled with
anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were to bring me yours, that you used before you took your
degree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes, yes! Forgot all about it--all! So many lives depending on
my attention, you see, my man, that I can't give so much thought as I
would like to other things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude controlled himself sufficiently long to make sure of the truth;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) repeated, in a voice of dry misery, <div class="bookquote">``You haven't brought 'em!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But you must get me some more orders from sick people, and I'll
bring the grammars next time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude dropped behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was an unsophisticated boy, but the gift of
sudden insight which is sometimes vouchsafed to children showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
all at once what shoddy humanity the quack was made of. There was to
be no intellectual light from this source. The leaves dropped from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) imaginary crown of laurel; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned to a gate, leant against it,
and cried bitterly.

<p/>The disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
might, perhaps, have obtained grammars from Alfredston, but to do
that required money, and a knowledge of what books to order; and
though physically comfortable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was in such absolute dependence as
to be without a farthing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own.

<p/>At this date Mr. Phillotson sent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) pianoforte, and it gave Jude
a lead. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) not write to the schoolmaster, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to
be so kind as to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) the grammars in Christminster? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might
slip a letter inside the case of the instrument, and it would be
sure to reach the desired eyes. Why not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to send any old
second-hand copies, which would have the charm of being mellowed by
the university atmosphere?

<p/>To tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) intention would be to defeat it. It was
necessary to act alone.

<p/>After a further consideration of a few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did act, and on the
day of the piano's departure, which happened to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) next birthday,
clandestinely placed the letter inside the packing-case, directed to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) much-admired friend, being afraid to reveal the operation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
aunt Drusilla, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Drusilla</b></font>) should discover his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) motive, and compel him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to
abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) scheme.

<p/>The piano was despatched, and Jude waited days and weeks, calling
every morning at the cottage post office before his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) great-aunt was
stirring. At last a packet did indeed arrive at the village, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
saw from the ends of it that it contained two thin books. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took it
away into a lonely place, and sat down on a felled elm to open it.

<p/>Ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) first ecstasy or vision of Christminster and its
possibilities, Jude had meditated much and curiously on the probable
sort of process that was involved in turning the expressions of one
language into those of another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) concluded that a grammar of the
required tongue would contain, primarily, a rule, prescription, or
clue of the nature of a secret cipher, which, once known, would
enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), by merely applying it, to change at will all words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
own speech into those of the foreign one. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) childish idea was, in
fact, a pushing to the extremity of mathematical precision what is
everywhere known as Grimm's Law--an aggrandizement of rough rules to
ideal completeness. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimm</b></font>) assumed that the words of the required
language were always to be found somewhere latent in the words of the
given language by those who had the art to uncover them, such art
being furnished by the books aforesaid.

<p/>When, therefore, having noted that the packet bore the postmark of
Christminster, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimm</b></font>) cut the string, opened the volumes, and turned to
the Latin grammar, which chanced to come uppermost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimm</b></font>) could scarcely
believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimm</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>The book was an old one--thirty years old, soiled, scribbled
wantonly over with a strange name in every variety of enmity to the
letterpress, and marked at random with dates twenty years earlier
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimm</b></font>) own day. But this was not the cause of Jude's amazement.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) learnt for the first time that there was no law of transmutation,
as in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) innocence he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had supposed -LRB-there was, in some degree, but
the grammarian did not recognize it-RRB-, but that every word in both
Latin and Greek was to be individually committed to memory at the
cost of years of plodding.

<p/>Jude flung down the books, lay backward along the broad trunk of the
elm, and was an utterly miserable boy for the space of a quarter of
an hour. As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had often done before, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
face and watched the sun peering insidiously at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) through the
interstices of the straw. This was Latin and Greek, then, was it
this grand delusion! The charm he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had supposed in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
really a labour like that of Israel in Egypt.

<p/>What brains they must have in Christminster and the great schools, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
presently thought, to learn words one by one up to tens of thousands!
There were no brains in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head equal to this business; and as the
little sun-rays continued to stream in through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
wished he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had never seen a book, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might never see another,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had never been born.

<p/>Somebody might have come along that way who would have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
trouble, and might have cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) by saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) notions were
further advanced than those of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grammarian. But nobody did come,
because nobody does; and under the crushing recognition of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
gigantic error Jude continued to wish himself out of the world.



<p/>V


<p/>During the three or four succeeding years a quaint and singular
vehicle might have been discerned moving along the lanes and by-roads
near Marygreen, driven in a quaint and singular way.

<p/>In the course of a month or two after the receipt of the books
Jude had grown callous to the shabby trick played him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) by the dead
languages. In fact, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) disappointment at the nature of those
tongues had, after a while, been the means of still further
glorifying the erudition of Christminster. To acquire languages,
departed or living in spite of such obstinacies as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now knew them
inherently to possess, was a herculean performance which gradually
led him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) on to a greater interest in it than in the presupposed patent
process. The mountain-weight of material under which the ideas lay
in those dusty volumes called the classics piqued him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) into a dogged,
mouselike subtlety of attempt to move it piecemeal.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had endeavoured to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) presence tolerable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) crusty
maiden aunt by assisting her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ability, and the
business of the little cottage bakery had grown in consequence. An
aged horse with a hanging head had been purchased for eight pounds at
a sale, a creaking cart with a whity-brown tilt obtained for a few
pounds more, and in this turn-out it became Jude's business thrice a
week to carry loaves of bread to the villagers and solitary cotters
immediately round Marygreen.

<p/>The singularity aforesaid lay, after all, less in the conveyance
itself than in Jude's manner of conducting it along its route.
Its interior was the scene of most of Jude's education by <div class="bookquote">``private
study.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>As soon as the horse had learnt the road and the houses
at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was to pause awhile, the boy, seated in front, would
slip the reins over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm, ingeniously fix open, by means of a
strap attached to the tilt, the volume he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was reading, spread the
dictionary on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees, and plunge into the simpler passages from
Caesar, Virgil, or Horace, as the case might be, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) purblind
stumbling way, and with an expenditure of labour that would have made
a tender-hearted pedagogue shed tears; yet somehow getting at the
meaning of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) read, and divining rather than beholding the
spirit of the original, which often to his (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) mind was something else
than that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) was taught to look for.

<p/>The only copies he (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) had been able to lay hands on were old Delphin
editions, because they were superseded, and therefore cheap. But,
bad for idle schoolboys, it did so happen that they were passably
good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>). The hampered and lonely itinerant conscientiously
covered up the marginal readings, and used them merely on points of
construction, as he (<font color='blue'><b>itinerant</b></font>) would have used a comrade or tutor who should
have happened to be passing by. And though Jude may have had little
chance of becoming a scholar by these rough and ready means, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was
in the way of getting into the groove he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wished to follow.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was busied with these ancient pages, which had already been
thumbed by hands possibly in the grave, digging out the thoughts
of these minds so remote yet so near, the bony old horse pursued
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) rounds, and Jude would be aroused from the woes of Dido by the
stoppage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cart and the voice of some old woman crying, <div class="bookquote">``Two
to-day, baker, and I return this stale one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>some woman</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was frequently met in the lanes by pedestrians and others without
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seeing them, and by degrees the people of the neighbourhood
began to talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) method of combining work and play -LRB-such they
considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reading to be-RRB-, which, though probably convenient
enough to himself, was not altogether a safe proceeding for other
travellers along the same roads. There were murmurs. Then a private
resident of an adjoining place informed the local policeman that the
baker's boy should not be allowed to read while driving, and insisted
that it was the constable's duty to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) in the act, and
take him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) to the police court at Alfredston, and get him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) fined for
dangerous practices on the highway. The policeman thereupon lay in
wait for Jude, and one day accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) and cautioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>As Jude had to get up at three o'clock in the morning to heat the
oven, and mix and set in the bread that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) distributed later in the
day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was obliged to go to bed at night immediately after laying
the sponge; so that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not read his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) classics on the highways
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could hardly study at all. The only thing to be done was,
therefore, to keep a sharp eye ahead and around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
could in the circumstances, and slip away his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) books as soon as
anybody loomed in the distance, the policeman in particular. To do
that official justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) did not put himself much in the way of
Jude's bread-cart, considering that in such a lonely district the
chief danger was to Jude himself, and often on seeing the white tilt
over the hedges he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would move in another direction.

<p/>On a day when Fawley was getting quite advanced, being now about
sixteen, and had been stumbling through the <div class="bookquote">``Carmen Sæculare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) way home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) found himself to be passing over the high edge of
the plateau by the Brown House. The light had changed, and it was
the sense of this which had caused him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) to look up. The sun was going
down, and the full moon was rising simultaneously behind the woods in
the opposite quarter. His (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) mind had become so impregnated with the
poem that, in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which years
before had caused him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) to kneel on the ladder, he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) stopped the horse,
alighted, and glancing round to see that nobody was in sight, knelt
down on the roadside bank with open book. He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) turned first to the
shiny goddess, who seemed to look so softly and critically at his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>)
doings, then to the disappearing luminary on the other hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>)
began:


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoebe silvarumque potens Diana!''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The horse stood still till he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) had finished the hymn, which Jude
repeated under the sway of a polytheistic fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would never
have thought of humouring in broad daylight.

<p/>Reaching home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mused over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) curious superstition, innate or
acquired, in doing this, and the strange forgetfulness which had led
to such a lapse from common sense and custom in one who wished, next
to being a scholar, to be a Christian divine. It had all come of
reading heathen works exclusively. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) thought of it the
more convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was of his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) inconsistency. He (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) began to wonder
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) could be reading quite the right books for his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) object
in life. Certainly there seemed little harmony between this pagan
literature and the mediæval colleges at Christminster, that
ecclesiastical romance in stone.

<p/>Ultimately he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) decided that in his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) sheer love of reading he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) had taken
up a wrong emotion for a Christian young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) had dabbled in
Clarke's Homer, but had never yet worked much at the New Testament
in the Greek, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) possessed a copy, obtained by post from a
second-hand bookseller. He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) abandoned the now familiar Ionic for a
new dialect, and for a long time onward limited his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) reading almost
entirely to the Gospels and Epistles in Griesbach's text. Moreover,
on going into Alfredston one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) was introduced to patristic
literature by finding at the bookseller's some volumes of the
Fathers which had been left behind by an insolvent clergyman of the
neighbourhood.

<p/>As another outcome of this change of groove he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) visited on Sundays all
the churches within a walk, and deciphered the Latin inscriptions on
fifteenth-century brasses and tombs. On one of these pilgrimages he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
met with a hunch-backed old woman of great intelligence, who read
everything she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could lay her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) more yet
of the romantic charms of the city of light and lore. Thither he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
resolved as firmly as ever to go.

<p/>But how live in that city? At present he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had no income at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
had no trade or calling of any dignity or stability whatever on which
he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) could subsist while carrying out an intellectual labour which
might spread over many years.

<p/>What was most required by citizens? Food, clothing, and shelter.
An income from any work in preparing the first would be too meagre;
for making the second he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) felt a distaste; the preparation of the
third requisite he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) inclined to. They built in a city; therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
would learn to build. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) unknown uncle, his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) cousin
Susanna's father, an ecclesiastical worker in metal, and somehow
mediæval art in any material was a trade for which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had rather a
fancy. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) could not go far wrong in following his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) uncle's footsteps,
and engaging himself awhile with the carcases that contained the
scholar souls.

<p/>As a preliminary he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) obtained some small blocks of freestone, metal
not being available, and suspending his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) studies awhile, occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>)
spare half-hours in copying the heads and capitals in his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) parish
church.

<p/>There was a stone-mason of a humble kind in Alfredston, and as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) had found a substitute for himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) aunt's little
business, he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) offered his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) services to this man for a trifling wage.
Here Jude had the opportunity of learning at least the rudiments of
freestone-working. Some time later he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went to a church-builder in
the same place, and under the architect's direction became handy at
restoring the dilapidated masonries of several village churches round
about.

<p/>Not forgetting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was only following up this handicraft as
a prop to lean on while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) prepared those greater engines which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) flattered himself would be better fitted for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) yet was
interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pursuit on its own account. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now had lodgings
during the week in the little town, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) returned to Marygreen
village every Saturday evening. And thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reached and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
nineteenth year.



<p/>VI


<p/>At this memorable date of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was, one Saturday, returning
from Alfredston to Marygreen about three o'clock in the afternoon.
It was fine, warm, and soft summer weather, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
tools at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) little chisels clinking faintly against the
larger ones in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) basket. It being the end of the week he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had left
work early, and had come out of the town by a round-about route which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not usually frequent, having promised to call at a flour-mill
near Cresscombe to execute a commission for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was in an enthusiastic mood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) way to living
comfortably in Christminster in the course of a year or two, and
knocking at the doors of one of those strongholds of learning of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had dreamed so much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might, of course, have gone there
now, in some capacity or other, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) preferred to enter the city
with a little more assurance as to means than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could be said to
feel at present. A warm self-content suffused him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) considered
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had already done. Now and then as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went along he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned
to face the peeps of country on either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hardly
saw them; the act was an automatic repetition of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had been
accustomed to do when less occupied; and the one matter which really
engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was the mental estimate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) progress thus far.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have acquired quite an average student's power to read the
common ancient classics, Latin in particular.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>This was true,
Jude possessing a facility in that language which enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with
great ease to himself to beguile his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lonely walks by imaginary
conversations therein.

<p/>``I have read two books of the _Iliad_, besides being pretty familiar
with passages such as the speech of Phoenix in the ninth book,
the fight of Hector and Ajax in the fourteenth, the appearance of
Achilles unarmed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) heavenly armour in the eighteenth, and the
funeral games in the twenty-third. I have also done some Hesiod, a
little scrap of Thucydides, and a lot of the Greek Testament... I
wish there was only one dialect all the same.

<p/>``I have done some mathematics, including the first six and the
eleventh and twelfth books of Euclid; and algebra as far as simple
equations.

<p/>``I know something of the Fathers, and something of Roman and English
history.

<p/>``These things are only a beginning. But I shall not make much
farther advance here, from the difficulty of getting books. Hence I
must next concentrate all my energies on settling in Christminster.
Once there I shall so advance, with the assistance I shall there
get, that my present knowledge will appear to me but as childish
ignorance. I must save money, and I will; and one of those colleges
shall open its doors to me--shall welcome whom now it would spurn,
if I wait twenty years for the welcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be D.D. before I have done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) continued to dream, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might become even a
bishop by leading a pure, energetic, wise, Christian life. And what
an example he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would set! If his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) income were #5000 a year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would
give away #4500 in one form and another, and live sumptuously -LRB-for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)-RRB- on the remainder. Well, on second thoughts, a bishop was
absurd. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) would draw the line at an archdeacon. Perhaps a man
could be as good and as learned and as useful in the capacity of
archdeacon as in that of bishop. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) thought of the bishop again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meanwhile I will read, as soon as I am settled in Christminster,
the books I have not been able to get hold of here: Livy, Tacitus,
Herodotus, Æschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha! Hoity-toity!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The sounds were expressed in light
voices on the other side of the hedge, but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did not notice them.
His (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) thoughts went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius, Epictetus, Seneca,
Antoninus. Then I must master other things: the Fathers thoroughly;
Bede and ecclesiastical history generally; a smattering of Hebrew--I
only know the letters as yet--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hoity-toity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--but I can work hard. I have staying power in abundance, thank
God! and it is that which tells... Yes, Christminster shall be my
Alma Mater; and I'll be her (<font color='blue'><b>Alma</b></font>) beloved son, in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alma</b></font>) shall be well
pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) deep concentration on these transactions of the future Jude's
walk had slackened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was now standing quite still, looking
at the ground as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic
lantern. On a sudden something smacked him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sharply in the ear, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) became aware that a soft cold substance had been flung at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and
had fallen at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) feet.

<p/>A glance told him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) what it was--a piece of flesh, the characteristic
part of a barrow-pig, which the countrymen used for greasing their
boots, as it was useless for any other purpose. Pigs were rather
plentiful hereabout, being bred and fattened in large numbers in
certain parts of North Wessex.

<p/>On the other side of the hedge was a stream, whence, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) now for
the first time realized, had come the slight sounds of voices and
laughter that had mingled with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dreams. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mounted the bank and
looked over the fence. On the further side of the stream stood a
small homestead, having a garden and pig-sties attached; in front of
it, beside the brook, three young women were kneeling, with buckets
and platters beside them containing heaps of pigs' chitterlings,
which they were washing in the running water. One or two pairs of
eyes slyly glanced up, and perceiving that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) attention had at last
been attracted, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was watching them, they braced themselves
for inspection by putting their mouths demurely into shape and
recommencing their rinsing operations with assiduity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude severely.

<p/>``I DIDN<div class="bookquote">``T throw it, I tell you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asserted one girl to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neighbour,
as if unconscious of the young man's presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the second answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Anny, how can you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the third.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had thrown anything at all, it shouldn't have been THAT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! I don't care for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And they laughed and continued their
work, without looking up, still ostentatiously accusing each other.

<p/>Jude grew sarcastic as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face, and caught their remarks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU didn't do it--oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said to the up-stream one of the three.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) addressed was a fine dark-eyed girl, not exactly
handsome, but capable of passing as such at a little distance,
despite some coarseness of skin and fibre. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a round and
prominent bosom, full lips, perfect teeth, and the rich complexion
of a Cochin hen's egg. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a complete and substantial female
animal--no more, no less; and Jude was almost certain that to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
attributable the enterprise of attracting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) attention from dreams
of the humaner letters to what was simmering in the minds around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you'll never be told,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) deedily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whoever did it was wasteful of other people's property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you want to speak to me, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; if you like to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) foresaw an opportunity; for somehow or other the eyes
of the brown girl rested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had said the words, and
there was a momentary flash of intelligence, a dumb announcement of
affinity _in posse_ between herself and him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), which, so far as Jude
Fawley was concerned, had no sort of premeditation in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had singled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out from the three, as a woman is singled out
in such cases, for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance, but
in commonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters,
unconsciously received by unfortunate men when the last intention of
their lives is to be occupied with the feminine.

<p/>Springing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Bring back what is lying there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
father's business had prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) signal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
basket of tools, picked up the scrap of offal, beat a pathway for
himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stick, and got over the hedge. They walked in
parallel lines, one on each bank of the stream, towards the small
plank bridge. As the girl drew nearer to it, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave without Jude
perceiving it, an adroit little suck to the interior of each of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
cheeks in succession, by which curious and original manoeuvre she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
brought as by magic upon its smooth and rotund surface a perfect
dimple, which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was able to retain there as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) continued
to smile. This production of dimples at will was a not unknown
operation, which many attempted, but only a few succeeded in
accomplishing.

<p/>They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
missile, seemed to expect her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to explain why she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had audaciously
stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards
and forwards on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till,
moved by amatory curiosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes critically upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't think _I_ would shy things at you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are doing this for my father, who naturally doesn't want anything
thrown away. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) makes that into dubbin.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nodded towards the
fragment on the grass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What made either of the others throw it, I wonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude asked,
politely accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) assertion, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had very large doubts as
to its truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Impudence. Don't tell folk it was I, mind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I? I don't know your name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no. Shall I tell it to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arabella Donn. I'm living here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must have known it if I had often come this way. But I mostly go
straight along the high-road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father is a pig-breeder, and these girls are helping me wash the
innerds for black-puddings and such like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding
each other and leaning against the hand-rail of the bridge. The
unvoiced call of woman to man, which was uttered very distinctly
by Arabella's personality, held Jude to the spot against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
intention--almost against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) will, and in a way new to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
experience. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that till this
moment Jude had never looked at a woman to consider her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as such, but
had vaguely regarded the sex as beings outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) life and purposes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) gazed from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth, thence to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
full round naked arms, wet, mottled with the chill of the water, and
firm as marble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a nice-looking girl you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured, though the words had
not been necessary to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) magnetism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you should see me Sundays!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said piquantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose I could?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) answered

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's for you to think on. There's nobody after me just now,
though there med be in a week or two.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had spoken this without
a smile, and the dimples disappeared.

<p/>Jude felt himself drifting strangely, but could not help it. <div class="bookquote">``Will
you let me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had managed to get back one dimple by turning
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face aside for a moment and repeating the odd little sucking
operation before mentioned, Jude being still unconscious of more than
a general impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appearance. <div class="bookquote">``Next Sunday?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hazarded.
<div class="bookquote">``To-morrow, that is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I call?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brightened with a little glow of triumph, swept him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) almost
tenderly with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes in turning, and retracing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) steps down the
brookside grass rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companions.

<p/>Jude Fawley shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) tool-basket and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) lonely way,
filled with an ardour at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) mentally stood at gaze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had
just inhaled a single breath from a new atmosphere, which had
evidently been hanging round him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) went, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) knew not
how long, but had somehow been divided from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) actual breathing as
by a sheet of glass. The intentions as to reading, working, and
learning, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had so precisely formulated only a few minutes
earlier, were suffering a curious collapse into a corner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) knew not
how.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's only a bit of fun,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) said to himself, faintly conscious
that to common sense there was something lacking, and still more
obviously something redundant in the nature of this girl who had
drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) which made it necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) should assert mere
sportiveness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) part as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) reason in seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--something in
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quite antipathetic to that side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) which had been occupied
with literary study and the magnificent Christminster dream. It had
been no vestal who chose THAT missile for opening her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attack on him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) saw this with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) intellectual eye, just for a short fleeting
while, as by the light of a falling lamp one might momentarily see an
inscription on a wall before being enshrouded in darkness. And then
this passing discriminative power was withdrawn, and Jude was lost to
all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure,
that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto
unsuspected, though it had lain close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was to meet
this enkindling one of the other sex on the following Sunday.

<p/>Meanwhile the girl had joined her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companions, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) silently
resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid
stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Catched un, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>laconically asked the girl called Anny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I wish I had thrown something else than that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>regretfully murmured Arabella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord! he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s nobody, though you med think so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) used to drive old
Drusilla Fawley's bread-cart out at Marygreen, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) `prenticed
himself at Alfredston. Since then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s been very stuck up, and
always reading. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wants to be a scholar, they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't care what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is, or anything about `n. Don't you think
it, my child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't ye! You needn't try to deceive us! What did you stay
talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) for, if you didn't want un? Whether you do or whether
you don't, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s as simple as a child. I could see it as you courted
on the bridge, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) looked at `ee as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had never seen a woman
before in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) born days. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s to be had by any woman who can
get him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to care for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a bit, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) likes to set herself to catch
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) the right way.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>VII


<p/>The next day Jude Fawley was pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) bedroom with the sloping
ceiling, looking at the books on the table, and then at the black
mark on the plaster above them, made by the smoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) lamp in past
months.

<p/>It was Sunday afternoon, four-and-twenty hours after his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) meeting with
Arabella Donn. During the whole bygone week he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had been resolving to
set this afternoon apart for a special purpose,--the re-reading of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) Greek Testament--his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) new one, with better type than his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) old copy,
following Griesbach's text as amended by numerous correctors, and
with variorum readings in the margin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) was proud of the book,
having obtained it by boldly writing to its London publisher, a thing
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had never done before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoon's reading, under
the quiet roof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) great-aunt's house as formerly, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) now
slept only two nights a week. But a new thing, a great hitch, had
happened yesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) life,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) felt as a snake must feel who has sloughed off its winter
skin, and cannot understand the brightness and sensitiveness of its
new one.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) would not go out to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>), after all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) sat down, opened the
book, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) elbows firmly planted on the table, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) hands
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) temples, began at the beginning:


<p/>HÊ KAINÊ DIATHÊKÊ


<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) promised to call for her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>)? Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had! She (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) would wait
indoors, poor girl, and waste all her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) afternoon on account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>).
There was a something in her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>), too, which was very winning, apart from
promises. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) ought not to break faith with her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>). Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had
only Sundays and week-day evenings for reading he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) could afford one
afternoon, seeing that other young men afforded so many. After
to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) would never probably see her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) again. Indeed, it would be
impossible, considering what his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) plans were.

<p/>In short, as if materially, a compelling arm of extraordinary
muscular power seized hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)--something which had nothing in
common with the spirits and influences that had moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) hitherto.
This seemed to care little for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) reason and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) will, nothing for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) so-called elevated intentions, and moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) along, as a violent
schoolmaster a schoolboy he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) has seized by the collar, in a direction
which tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) had no
respect, and whose life had nothing in common with his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) own except
locality.


<p/>HÊ KAINÊ DIATHÊKÊ was no more heeded, and the predestinate Jude
sprang up and across the room. Foreseeing such an event he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
already arrayed himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) best clothes. In three minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was
out of the house and descending by the path across the wide vacant
hollow of corn-ground which lay between the village and the isolated
house of Arabella in the dip beyond the upland.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) walked he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) could be back in two hours,
easily, and a good long time would still remain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) for reading
after tea.

<p/>Passing the few unhealthy fir-trees and cottage where the path
joined the highway he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) hastened along, and struck away to the left,
descending the steep side of the country to the west of the Brown
House. Here at the base of the chalk formation he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) neared the brook
that oozed from it, and followed the stream till he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
dwelling. A smell of piggeries came from the back, and the grunting
of the originators of that smell. He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) entered the garden, and knocked
at the door with the knob of his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) stick.

<p/>Somebody had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) through the window, for a male voice on the
inside said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Arabella! Here's your young man come coorting! Mizzle, my girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude winced at the words. Courting in such a businesslike aspect as
it evidently wore to the speaker was the last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was thinking
of. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was going to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), perhaps kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>); but <div class="bookquote">``courting''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>was too coolly purposeful to be anything but repugnant to his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) ideas.
The door was opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) entered, just as Arabella came downstairs
in radiant walking attire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a chair, Mr. What's-your-name?''  (<font color='red'><b>father man</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) father, an energetic,
black-whiskered man, in the same businesslike tones Jude had heard
from outside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather go out at once, wouldn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) whispered to Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We'll walk up to the Brown House and back, we can
do it in half an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella looked so handsome amid her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) untidy surroundings that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) felt
glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had come, and all the misgivings vanished that had hitherto
haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>).

<p/>First they clambered to the top of the great down, during which
ascent he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had occasionally to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) hand to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>). Then
they bore off to the left along the crest into the ridgeway, which
they followed till it intersected the high-road at the Brown
House aforesaid, the spot of his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) former fervid desires to behold
Christminster. But he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) forgot them now. He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) talked the commonest
local twaddle to Arabella with greater zest than he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) would have felt
in discussing all the philosophies with all the Dons in the recently
adored university, and passed the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had knelt to Diana
and Phoebus without remembering that there were any such people in
the mythology, or that the sun was anything else than a useful
lamp for illuminating Arabella's face. An indescribable lightness
of heel served to lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) along; and Jude, the incipient scholar,
prospective D.D., professor, bishop, or what not, felt himself
honoured and glorified by the condescension of this handsome country
wench in agreeing to take a walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) Sunday frock and
ribbons.

<p/>They reached the Brown House barn--the point at which he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) had planned
to turn back. While looking over the vast northern landscape from
this spot they were struck by the rising of a dense volume of smoke
from the neighbourhood of the little town which lay beneath them at a
distance of a couple of miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``Let's run and see it--do! It is not
far!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>The tenderness which had grown up in Jude's bosom left him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) no will to
thwart her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) inclination now--which pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) in affording him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) excuse
for a longer time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>). They started off down the hill almost at
a trot; but on gaining level ground at the bottom, and walking a
mile, they found that the spot of the fire was much further off than
it had seemed.

<p/>Having begun their journey, however, they pushed on; but it was not
till five o'clock that they found themselves on the scene,--the
distance being altogether about half-a-dozen miles from Marygreen,
and three from Arabella's. The conflagration had been got under
by the time they reached it, and after a short inspection of the
melancholy ruins they retraced their steps--their course lying
through the town of Alfredston.

<p/>Arabella said she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) would like some tea, and they entered an inn of an
inferior class, and gave their order. As it was not for beer they
had a long time to wait. The maid-servant recognized Jude, and
whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) surprise to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mistress in the background, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
the student <div class="bookquote">``who kept hisself up so particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>the student</b></font>)</div>should have suddenly
descended so low as to keep company with Arabella. The latter
guessed what was being said, and laughed as she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) met the serious and
tender gaze of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lover--the low and triumphant laugh of a careless
woman who sees she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) is winning her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) game.

<p/>They sat and looked round the room, and at the picture of Samson and
Delilah which hung on the wall, and at the circular beer-stains on
the table, and at the spittoons underfoot filled with sawdust. The
whole aspect of the scene had that depressing effect on Jude which
few places can produce like a tap-room on a Sunday evening when
the setting sun is slanting in, and no liquor is going, and the
unfortunate wayfarer finds himself with no other haven of rest.

<p/>It began to grow dusk. They could not wait longer, really, for the
tea, they said. <div class="bookquote">``Yet what else can we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>asked Jude. <div class="bookquote">``It is a
three-mile walk for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we can have some beer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beer, oh yes. I had forgotten that. Somehow it seems odd to come
to a public-house for beer on a Sunday evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we didn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude by this time wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was out of such an
uncongenial atmosphere; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ordered the beer, which was promptly
brought.

<p/>Arabella tasted it. <div class="bookquote">``Ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/>Jude tasted. <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
understand beer very much now, it is true. I like it well enough,
but it is bad to read on, and I find coffee better. But this seems
all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Adulterated--I can't touch it!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mentioned three or four
ingredients that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops,
much to Jude's surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said good-humouredly.

<p/>Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) returned to the beer and drank her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) share, and they
went on their way. It was now nearly dark, and as soon as they had
withdrawn from the lights of the town they walked closer together,
till they touched each other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) waist, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) merely said what to himself
seemed a quite bold enough thing: <div class="bookquote">``Take my arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took it, thoroughly, up to the shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt the warmth of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) body against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stick under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) other arm held
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) right hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) right as it rested in its place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we are well together, dear, aren't we?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>); adding to herself: <div class="bookquote">``Rather mild!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How fast I have become!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was thinking.

<p/>Thus they walked till they reached the foot of the upland, where they
could see the white highway ascending before them in the gloom. From
this point the only way of getting to Arabella's was by going up the
incline, and dipping again into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) valley on the right. Before they
had climbed far they were nearly run into by two men who had been
walking on the grass unseen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These lovers--you find 'em out o' doors in all seasons and
weathers--lovers and homeless dogs only,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>said one of the men as
they vanished down the hill.

<p/>Arabella tittered lightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we lovers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>asked Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) shoulder. Jude took the
hint, and encircling her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) waist with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm, pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>They walked now no longer arm in arm but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had desired, clasped
together. After all, what did it matter since it was dark, said Jude
to himself. When they were half-way up the long hill they paused as
by arrangement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) again. They reached the top, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can keep your arm there, if you would like to,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said gently.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did so, thinking how trusting she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was.

<p/>Thus they slowly went towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cottage
at half-past three, intending to be sitting down again to the New
Testament by half-past five. It was nine o'clock when, with another
embrace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stood to deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) father's door.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to come in, if only for a minute, as it would seem so
odd otherwise, and as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had been out alone in the dark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) gave
way, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in. Immediately that the door was opened he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
found, in addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) parents, several neighbours sitting round.
They all spoke in a congratulatory manner, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seriously as
Arabella's intended partner.

<p/>They did not belong to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) set or circle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) felt out of place
and embarrassed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had not meant this: a mere afternoon of
pleasant walking with Arabella, that was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) did
not stay longer than to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stepmother, a simple, quiet
woman without features or character; and bidding them all good night
plunged with a sense of relief into the track over the down.

<p/>But that sense was only temporary: Arabella soon re-asserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
sway in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) walked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) felt himself to be another man
from the Jude of yesterday. What were his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) books to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)? what were
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) intentions, hitherto adhered to so strictly, as to not wasting a
single minute of time day by day? <div class="bookquote">``Wasting!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It depended on your
point of view to define that: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was just living for the first
time: not wasting life. It was better to love a woman than to be a
graduate, or a parson; ay, or a pope!

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) got back to the house his (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) aunt had gone to bed, and a general
consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) neglect seemed written on the face of all things
confronting him (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) went upstairs without a light, and the dim
interior of his (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) room accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) with sad inquiry. There lay his (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>)
book open, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) had left it, and the capital letters on the
title-page regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>pope</b></font>) with fixed reproach in the grey starlight,
like the unclosed eyes of a dead man:


<p/>HÊ KAINÊ DIATHÊKÊ


<p/>* * * * * *


<p/>Jude had to leave early next morning for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) usual week of absence at
lodgings; and it was with a sense of futility that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) threw into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
basket upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tools and other necessaries the unread book he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) impassioned doings a secret almost from himself.
Arabella, on the contrary, made them public among all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) friends
and acquaintances.

<p/>Retracing by the light of dawn the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had followed a few hours
earlier under cover of darkness, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) sweetheart by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
reached the bottom of the hill, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) walked slowly, and stood
still. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) was on the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) the first kiss. As
the sun had only just risen it was possible that nobody had passed
there since. Jude looked on the ground and sighed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked
closely, and could just discern in the damp dust the imprints of
their feet as they had stood locked in each other's arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) was
not there now, and <div class="bookquote">``the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of
nature''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>so depicted her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) past presence that a void was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heart
which nothing could fill. A pollard willow stood close to the place,
and that willow was different from all other willows in the world.
Utter annihilation of the six days which must elapse before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could
see her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had promised would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) intensest wish
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had had only the week to live.

<p/>An hour and a half later Arabella came along the same way with her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>)
two companions of the Saturday. She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) passed unheedingly the scene of
the kiss, and the willow that marked it, though chattering freely on
the subject to the other two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>) tell `ee next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>) said--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) related almost word for word some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
tenderest speeches. If Jude had been behind the fence he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would have
felt not a little surprised at learning how very few of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sayings
and doings on the previous evening were private.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got him (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>) to care for `ee a bit, `nation if you han't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anny</b></font>)</div>murmured Anny judicially. <div class="bookquote">``It's well to be you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>In a few moments Arabella replied in a curiously low, hungry tone of
latent sensuousness: <div class="bookquote">``I've got him (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>) to care for me: yes! But I want
him (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>) to more than care for me; I want him (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>) to have me--to marry me! I
must have him (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>). I can't do without him (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>)'s the sort of man I long
for. I shall go mad if I can't give myself to him (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>) altogether! I
felt I should when I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As he (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>) is a romancing, straightfor`ard, honest chap, he (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>)'s to be had,

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella remained thinking awhile. <div class="bookquote">``What med be the right way?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you don't know--you don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, the third girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On my word I don't!--No further, that is, than by plain courting,
and taking care he (<font color='blue'><b>lovers</b></font>) don't go too far!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The third girl looked at the second. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) DON<div class="bookquote">``T know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis clear she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anny</b></font>)</div>said Anny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And having lived in a town, too, as one may say! Well, we can teach

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And how do you mean--a sure way to gain a man? Take me for an

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a husband.''

no friend that harm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), of course!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella's companions looked at each other, and turning up their eyes
in drollery began smirking. Then one went up close to Arabella, and,
although nobody was near, imparted some information in a low tone,
the other observing curiously the effect upon Arabella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the last-named slowly. ``I own I didn't think of that
way! ... But suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ISN<div class="bookquote">``T honourable? A woman had better not

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way in silent thought. <div class="bookquote">``I'll try it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
whispered; but not to them.



<p/>VIII


<p/>One week's end Jude was as usual walking out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt's at
Marygreen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lodging in Alfredston, a walk which now had large
attractions for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) quite other than his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) desire to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aged and
morose relative. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) diverged to the right before ascending the hill
with the single purpose of gaining, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) way, a glimpse of Arabella
that should not come into the reckoning of regular appointments.
Before quite reaching the homestead his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) alert eye perceived the top
of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) head moving quickly hither and thither over the garden hedge.
Entering the gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) found that three young unfattened pigs had
escaped from their sty by leaping clean over the top, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
was endeavouring unassisted to drive them in through the door which
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had set open. The lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) countenance changed from the
rigidity of business to the softness of love when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) saw Jude, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) eyes languishingly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). The animals took advantage
of the pause by doubling and bolting out of the way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They were only put in this morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cried, stimulated to pursue
in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) lover's presence. <div class="bookquote">``They were drove from Spaddleholt
Farm only yesterday, where Father bought 'em at a stiff price enough.
They are wanting to get home again, the stupid toads! Will you shut
the garden gate, dear, and help me to get 'em in. There are no men
folk at home, only Mother, and they'll be lost if we don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) set himself to assist, and dodged this way and that over the
potato rows and the cabbages. Every now and then they ran together,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) for a moment and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). The first pig was
got back promptly; the second with some difficulty; the third a
long-legged creature, was more obstinate and agile. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) plunged
through a hole in the garden hedge, and into the lane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'ll be lost if I don't follow `n!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come along with
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) rushed in full pursuit out of the garden, Jude alongside her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),
barely contriving to keep the fugitive in sight. Occasionally they
would shout to some boy to stop the animal, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) always wriggled
past and ran on as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me take your hand, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``You are getting out of
breath.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) now hot hand with apparent willingness,
and they trotted along together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This comes of driving 'em home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) remarked. <div class="bookquote">``They always know
the way back if you do that. They ought to have been carted over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time the pig had reached an unfastened gate admitting to the
open down, across which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sped with all the agility his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) little legs
afforded. As soon as the pursuers had entered and ascended to the
top of the high ground it became apparent that they would have to run
all the way to the farmer's if they wished to get at him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>). From this
summit he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could be seen as a minute speck, following an unerring line
towards his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) old home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>cried Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'ll be there long before we get
there. It don't matter now we know he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s not lost or stolen on the
way. They'll see it is ours, and send un back. Oh dear, how hot I
be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Without relinquishing her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hold of Jude's hand she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) swerved aside and
flung herself down on the sod under a stunted thorn, precipitately
pulling Jude on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knees at the same time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I ask pardon--I nearly threw you down, didn't I! But I am so
tired!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) lay supine, and straight as an arrow, on the sloping sod of this
hill-top, gazing up into the blue miles of sky, and still retaining
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) warm hold of Jude's hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reclined on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) elbow near her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've run all this way for nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) went on, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) form heaving
and falling in quick pants, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) face flushed, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) full red lips
parted, and a fine dew of perspiration on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) skin. <div class="bookquote">``Well--why don't
you speak, deary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm blown too. It was all up hill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were in absolute solitude--the most apparent of all solitudes,
that of empty surrounding space. Nobody could be nearer than a mile
to them without their seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). They were, in fact, on one of the
summits of the county, and the distant landscape around Christminster
could be discerned from where they lay. But Jude did not think of
that then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can see such a pretty thing up this tree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``A
sort of a--caterpillar, of the most loveliest green and yellow you
ever came across!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, sitting up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) there--you must come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) bent nearer and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head in front of hers. <div class="bookquote">``No--I can't see
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, on the limb there where it branches off--close to the moving
leaf--there!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) gently pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) repeated, the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
cheek. <div class="bookquote">``But I can, perhaps, standing up.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stood accordingly,
placing himself in the direct line of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) gaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How stupid you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said crossly, turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care to see it, dear: why should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) replied looking
down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Get up, Abby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to let me kiss you. I've been waiting to ever so long!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) rolled round her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) face, remained a moment looking deedily aslant
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>); then with a slight curl of the lip sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) feet, and
exclaiming abruptly <div class="bookquote">``I must mizzle!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lip</b></font>)</div>walked off quickly homeward.
Jude followed and rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just one!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) coaxed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), surprised: <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) two lips resentfully together, and Jude followed her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
like a pet lamb till she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) slackened her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) pace and walked beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
talking calmly on indifferent subjects, and always checking him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tried to take her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hand or clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) waist. Thus they descended
to the precincts of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) father's homestead, and Arabella went in,
nodding good-bye to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) with a supercilious, affronted air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect I took too much liberty with her (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>), somehow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude said to
himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) withdrew with a sigh and went on to Marygreen.

<p/>On Sunday morning the interior of Arabella's home was, as usual,
the scene of a grand weekly cooking, the preparation of the special
Sunday dinner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) father was shaving before a little glass hung on
the mullion of the window, and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mother and Arabella herself were
shelling beans hard by. A neighbour passed on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) way home from
morning service at the nearest church, and seeing Donn engaged at
the window with the razor, nodded and came in.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) at once spoke playfully to Arabella: <div class="bookquote">``I zeed `ee running with
`un--hee-hee! I hope `tis coming to something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) face without
raising her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>)'s for Christminster, I hear, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) can get there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard that lately--quite lately?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>asked Arabella with a
jealous, tigerish indrawing of breath.

<p/>``Oh no! But it has been known a long time that it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>)'s
on'y waiting here for an opening. Ah well: he (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) must walk about with
somebody, I s`pose. Young men don't mean much now-a-days. ``Tis a sip
here and a sip there with 'em. <div class="bookquote">``Twas different in my time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>When the gossip had departed Arabella said suddenly to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mother:
<div class="bookquote">``I want you and Father to go and inquire how the Edlins be, this
evening after tea. Or no--there's evening service at Fensworth--you
can walk to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh? What's up to-night, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. Only I want the house to myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s shy; and I can't
get un to come in when you are here. I shall let him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) slip through my
fingers if I don't mind, much as I care for `n!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is fine we med as well go, since you wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>In the afternoon Arabella met and walked with Jude, who had now
for weeks ceased to look into a book of Greek, Latin, or any other
tongue. They wandered up the slopes till they reached the green
track along the ridge, which they followed to the circular British
earth-bank adjoining, Jude thinking of the great age of the trackway,
and of the drovers who had frequented it, probably before the Romans
knew the country. Up from the level lands below them floated the
chime of church bells. Presently they were reduced to one note,
which quickened, and stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we'll go back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella, who had attended to the sounds.

<p/>Jude assented. So long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was near her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) minded little where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
was. When they arrived at her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) house he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said lingeringly: <div class="bookquote">``I won't
come in. Why are you in such a hurry to go in to-night? It is not
near dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) tried the handle of the door and
found it locked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--they are gone to church,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) added. And searching behind the
scraper she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) found the key and unlocked the door. <div class="bookquote">``Now, you'll come
in a moment?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) asked lightly. <div class="bookquote">``We shall be all alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude with alacrity, the case being unexpectedly
altered.

<p/>Indoors they went. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) want any tea? No, it was too late: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
would rather sit and talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) jacket and hat,
and they sat down--naturally enough close together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't touch me, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``I am part egg-shell. Or
perhaps I had better put it in a safe place.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) began unfastening
the collar of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An egg--a cochin's egg. I am hatching a very rare sort. I carry it
about everywhere with me, and it will get hatched in less than three
weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you carry it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just here.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) bosom and drew out the egg,
which was wrapped in wool, outside it being a piece of pig's bladder,
in case of accidents. Having exhibited it to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) put it back,
<div class="bookquote">``Now mind you don't come near me. I don't want to get it broke, and
have to begin another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you do such a strange thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an old custom. I suppose it is natural for a woman to want to
bring live things into the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very awkward for me just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It serves you right. There--that's all you can have of me''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had turned round her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) chair, and, reaching over the back of it,
presented her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) cheek to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) gingerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very shabby of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have catched me a minute ago when I had put the egg down!
There!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said defiantly, <div class="bookquote">``I am without it now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had quickly
withdrawn the egg a second time; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could quite reach her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had put it back as quickly, laughing with the excitement of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
strategy. Then there was a little struggle, Jude making a plunge for
it and capturing it triumphantly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) face flushed; and becoming
suddenly conscious he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) flushed also.

<p/>They looked at each other, panting; till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) rose and said: <div class="bookquote">``One kiss,
now I can do it without damage to property; and I'll go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had jumped up too. <div class="bookquote">``You must find me first!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) cried.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lover followed her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) withdrew. It was now dark inside the
room, and the window being small he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could not discover for a long
time what had become of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), till a laugh revealed her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to have rushed
up the stairs, whither Jude rushed at her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) heels.



<p/>IX


<p/>It was some two months later in the year, and the pair had met
constantly during the interval. Arabella seemed dissatisfied; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
was always imagining, and waiting, and wondering.

<p/>One day she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) met the itinerant Vilbert. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), like all the cottagers
thereabout, knew the quack well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) began telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
experiences. Arabella had been gloomy, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
had grown brighter. That evening she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) kept an appointment with Jude,
who seemed sad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I think I ought to go. I think
it will be better both for you and for me. I wish some things had
never begun! I was much to blame, I know. But it is never too late
to mend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella began to cry. <div class="bookquote">``How do you know it is not too late?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``That's all very well to say! I haven't told you yet!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) face with streaming eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) asked, turning pale. <div class="bookquote">``Not...?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! And what shall I do if you desert me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Arabella--how can you say that, my dear! You KNOW I wouldn't
desert you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have next to no wages as yet, you know; or perhaps I should have
thought of this before... But, of course if that's the case, we must
marry! What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought--I thought, deary, perhaps you would go away all the more
for that, and leave me to face it alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew better! Of course I never dreamt six months ago, or even
three, of marrying. It is a complete smashing up of my plans--I mean
my plans before I knew you, my dear. But what are they, after all!
Dreams about books, and degrees, and impossible fellowships, and all
that. Certainly we'll marry: we must!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That night he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) went out alone, and walked in the dark self-communing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) knew well, too well, in the secret centre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) brain, that
Arabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind.
Yet, such being the custom of the rural districts among honourable
young men who had drifted so far into intimacy with a woman as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
unfortunately had done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) was ready to abide by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had said,
and take the consequences. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) own soothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) kept up a
factitious belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the thing of most
consequence, not Arabella herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) sometimes said laconically.

<p/>The banns were put in and published the very next Sunday. The people
of the parish all said what a simple fool young Fawley was. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)
reading had only come to this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) would have to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) books
to buy saucepans. Those who guessed the probable state of affairs,
Arabella's parents being among them, declared that it was the sort of
conduct they would have expected of such an honest young man as Jude
in reparation of the wrong he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) innocent sweetheart. The
parson who married them seemed to think it satisfactory too. And so,
standing before the aforesaid officiator, the two swore that at every
other time of their lives till death took them, they would assuredly
believe, feel, and desire precisely as they had believed, felt, and
desired during the few preceding weeks. What was as remarkable
as the undertaking itself was the fact that nobody seemed at all
surprised at what they swore.

<p/>Fawley's aunt being a baker she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) a bride-cake, saying
bitterly that it was the last thing she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>), poor silly
fellow; and that it would have been far better if, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)
living to trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had gone underground years before with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)
father and mother. Of this cake Arabella took some slices, wrapped
them up in white note-paper, and sent them to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) companions in the
pork-dressing business, Anny and Sarah, labelling each packet <div class="bookquote">''_In
remembrance of good advice_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah</b></font>)</div><p/>The prospects of the newly married couple were certainly not very
brilliant even to the most sanguine mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), a stone-mason's
apprentice, nineteen years of age, was working for half wages till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) should be out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) time. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) wife was absolutely useless in a
town-lodging, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) at first had considered it would be necessary
for them to live. But the urgent need of adding to income in ever so
little a degree caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) to take a lonely roadside cottage between
the Brown House and Marygreen, that he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) might have the profits of a
vegetable garden, and utilize her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) past experiences by letting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
keep a pig. But it was not the sort of life he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) had bargained for,
and it was a long way to walk to and from Alfredston every day.
Arabella, however, felt that all these make-shifts were temporary;
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had gained a husband; that was the thing--a husband with a lot
of earning power in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for buying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) frocks and hats when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should
begin to get frightened a bit, and stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trade, and throw
aside those stupid books for practical undertakings.

<p/>So to the cottage he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) on the evening of the marriage, giving
up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) old room at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) aunt's--where so much of the hard labour at
Greek and Latin had been carried on.

<p/>A little chill overspread him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) first unrobing. A long tail of
hair, which Arabella wore twisted up in an enormous knob at the back
of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) head, was deliberately unfastened, stroked out, and hung upon
the looking-glass which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had bought her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--it wasn't your own?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said, with a sudden distaste for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--it never is nowadays with the better class.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! Perhaps not in towns. But in the country it is supposed
to be different. Besides, you've enough of your own, surely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, enough as country notions go. But in town the men expect more,
and when I was barmaid at Aldbrickham--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Barmaid at Aldbrickham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, not exactly barmaid--I used to draw the drink at a
public-house there--just for a little time; that was all. Some
people put me up to getting this, and I bought it just for a fancy.
The more you have the better in Aldbrickham, which is a finer town
than all your Christminsters. Every lady of position wears false
hair--the barber's assistant told me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude thought with a feeling of sickness that though this might be
true to some extent, for all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew, many unsophisticated girls
would and did go to towns and remain there for years without losing
their simplicity of life and embellishments. Others, alas, had an
instinct towards artificiality in their very blood, and became adepts
in counterfeiting at the first glimpse of it. However, perhaps there
was no great sin in a woman adding to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) resolved to
think no more of it.

<p/>A new-made wife can usually manage to excite interest for a few
weeks, even though the prospects of the household ways and means
are cloudy. There is a certain piquancy about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) situation, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) acquaintance at the sense of it, which carries off
the gloom of facts, and renders even the humblest bride independent
awhile of the real. Mrs. Jude Fawley was walking in the streets of
Alfredston one market-day with this quality in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) carriage when she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
met Anny her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) former friend, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had not seen since the wedding.

<p/>As usual they laughed before talking; the world seemed funny to them
without saying it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it turned out a good plan, you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>remarked the girl to the
wife. <div class="bookquote">``I knew it would with such as him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>)'s a dear good fellow,
and you ought to be proud of un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fawley quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when do you expect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ssh! Not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Arabella, Arabella; you be a deep one! Mistaken! well, that's
clever--it's a real stroke of genius! It is a thing I never thought
o', wi' all my experience! I never thought beyond bringing about the
real thing--not that one could sham it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Don't you be too quick to cry sham! <div class="bookquote">``Twasn't sham. I didn't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My word--won't he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) be in a taking! He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>)'ll give it to `ee o' Saturday
nights! Whatever it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>)'ll say it was a trick--a double one, by
the Lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll own to the first, but not to the second... Pooh--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) won't
care! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll be glad I was wrong in what I said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll shake down,
bless `ee--men always do. What can 'em do otherwise? Married is
married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that Arabella approached
the time when in the natural course of things she (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) would have to
reveal that the alarm she (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had raised had been without foundation.
The occasion was one evening at bedtime, and they were in their
chamber in the lonely cottage by the wayside to which Jude walked
home from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) work every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had worked hard the whole twelve
hours, and had retired to rest before his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came into
the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was between sleeping and waking, and was barely conscious
of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) undressing before the little looking-glass as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lay.

<p/>One action of hers, however, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to full cognition. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face
being reflected towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could perceive that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
was amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the
dimple before alluded to, a curious accomplishment of which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
mistress, effecting it by a momentary suction. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) for
the first time that the dimples were far oftener absent from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face
during his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nowadays than they had been in the
earlier weeks of their acquaintance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do that, Arabella!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``There is no harm in
it, but--I don't like to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned and laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Lord, I didn't know you were awake!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``How countrified you are! That's nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you learn it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nowhere that I know of. They used to stay without any trouble when
I was at the public-house; but now they won't. My face was fatter
then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care about dimples. I don't think they improve a
woman--particularly a married woman, and of full-sized figure like
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most men think otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care what most men think, if they do. How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to be told so when I was serving in the tap-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--that public-house experience accounts for your knowing about
the adulteration of the ale when we went and had some that Sunday
evening. I thought when I married you that you had always lived in
your father's house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have known better than that, and seen I was a little
more finished than I could have been by staying where I was born.
There was not much to do at home, and I was eating my head off, so I
went away for three months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll soon have plenty to do now, dear, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course--little things to make.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When will it be? Can't you tell me exactly, instead of in such
general terms as you have used?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--the date.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing to tell. I made a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sat bolt upright in bed and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How can that be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women fancy wrong things sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--! Why, of course, so unprepared as I was, without a stick of
furniture, and hardly a shilling, I shouldn't have hurried on our
affair, and brought you to a half-furnished hut before I was ready,
if it had not been for the news you gave me, which made it necessary
to save you, ready or no... Good God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't take on, dear. What's done can't be undone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no more to say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) gave the answer simply, and lay down; and there was silence
between them.

<p/>When Jude awoke the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed to see the world with a
different eye. As to the point in question he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was compelled to
accept her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) word; in the circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not have acted
otherwise while ordinary notions prevailed. But how came they to
prevail?

<p/>There seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), vaguely and dimly, something wrong in a social
ritual which made necessary a cancelling of well-formed schemes
involving years of thought and labour, of foregoing a man's one
opportunity of showing himself superior to the lower animals, and of
contributing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) units of work to the general progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
generation, because of a momentary surprise by a new and transitory
instinct which had nothing in it of the nature of vice, and could be
only at the most called weakness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was inclined to inquire what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had done, or she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost, for that matter, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deserved to be caught
in a gin which would cripple him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), if not her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also, for the rest of a
lifetime? There was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the
immediate reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage had proved to be non-existent. But
the marriage remained.



<p/>X


<p/>The time arrived for killing the pig which Jude and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife had
fattened in their sty during the autumn months, and the butchering
was timed to take place as soon as it was light in the morning, so
that Jude might get to Alfredston without losing more than a quarter
of a day.

<p/>The night had seemed strangely silent. Jude looked out of the window
long before dawn, and perceived that the ground was covered with
snow--snow rather deep for the season, it seemed, a few flakes still
falling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid the pig-killer won't be able to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said to
Arabella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll come. You must get up and make the water hot, if you want
Challow to scald him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Though I like singeing best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``I like the way of my own county.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went downstairs, lit the fire under the copper, and began feeding
it with bean-stalks, all the time without a candle, the blaze
flinging a cheerful shine into the room; though for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) the sense of
cheerfulness was lessened by thoughts on the reason of that blaze--to
heat water to scald the bristles from the body of an animal that as
yet lived, and whose voice could be continually heard from a corner
of the garden. At half-past six, the time of appointment with the
butcher, the water boiled, and Jude's wife came downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Challow come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They waited, and it grew lighter, with the dreary light of a snowy
dawn. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went out, gazed along the road, and returning said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s
not coming. Drunk last night, I expect. The snow is not enough to
hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), surely!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we must put it off. It is only the water boiled for nothing.
The snow may be deep in the valley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't be put off. There's no more victuals for the pig. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ate the
last mixing o' barleymeal yesterday morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday morning? What has he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lived on since?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has been starving?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. We always do it the last day or two, to save bother with the
innerds. What ignorance, not to know that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That accounts for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) crying so. Poor creature!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--you must do the sticking--there's no help for it. I'll show
you how. Or I'll do it myself--I think I could. Though as it is
such a big pig I had rather Challow had done it. However, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) basket
o' knives and things have been already sent on here, and we can use
'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you shan't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``I'll do it, since it must
be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went out to the sty, shovelled away the snow for the space of a
couple of yards or more, and placed the stool in front, with the
knives and ropes at hand. A robin peered down at the preparations
from the nearest tree, and, not liking the sinister look of the
scene, flew away, though hungry. By this time Arabella had joined
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, and Jude, rope in hand, got into the sty, and noosed the
affrighted animal, who, beginning with a squeak of surprise, rose to
repeated cries of rage. Arabella opened the sty-door, and together
they hoisted the victim on to the stool, legs upward, and while Jude
held him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) Arabella bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) down, looping the cord over his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) legs to
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) from struggling.

<p/>The animal's note changed its quality. It was not now rage, but the
cry of despair; long-drawn, slow and hopeless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul I would sooner have gone without the pig than have had
this to do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``A creature I have fed with my own hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be such a tender-hearted fool! There's the sticking-knife--
the one with the point. Now whatever you do, don't stick un too
deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll stick him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) effectually, so as to make short work of it. That's
the chief thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``The meat must be well bled, and to do
that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) must die slow. We shall lose a shilling a score if the meat
is red and bloody! Just touch the vein, that's all. I was brought
up to it, and I know. Every good butcher keeps un bleeding long.
He (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) ought to be eight or ten minutes dying, at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) shall not be half a minute if I can help it, however the meat may
look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude determinedly. Scraping the bristles from the pig's
upturned throat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had seen the butchers do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) slit the fat;
then plunged in the knife with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Od damn it all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``that ever I should say it! You've
over-stuck un! And I telling you all the time--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do be quiet, Arabella, and have a little pity on the creature!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold up the pail to catch the blood, and don't talk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>However unworkmanlike the deed, it had been mercifully done. The
blood flowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
had desired. The dying animal's cry assumed its third and final
tone, the shriek of agony; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) glazing eyes riveting themselves on
Arabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing
at last the treachery of those who had seemed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) only friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make un stop that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``Such a noise will bring
somebody or other up here, and I don't want people to know we are
doing it ourselves.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Picking up the knife from the ground whereon
Jude had flung it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) slipped it into the gash, and slit the
windpipe. The pig was instantly silent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dying breath coming
through the hole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a hateful business!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pigs must be killed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The animal heaved in a final convulsion, and, despite the rope,
kicked out with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) last strength. A tablespoonful of black
clot came forth, the trickling of red blood having ceased for some
seconds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)'ll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Artful creatures--they always
keep back a drop like that as long as they can!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>The last plunge had come so unexpectedly as to make Jude stagger, and
in recovering himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) kicked over the vessel in which the blood
had been caught.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) cried, thoroughly in a passion. <div class="bookquote">``Now I can't make any
blackpot. There's a waste, all through you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude put the pail upright, but only about a third of the whole
steaming liquid was left in it, the main part being splashed over
the snow, and forming a dismal, sordid, ugly spectacle--to those who
saw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat. The lips and
nostrils of the animal turned livid, then white, and the muscles of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) limbs relaxed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's God got to do with such a messy job as a pig-killing, I
should like to know!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said scornfully. <div class="bookquote">``Poor folks must live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't scold you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly they became aware of a voice at hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, young married volk! I couldn't have carried it out much
better myself, cuss me if I could!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>The voice, which was husky,
came from the garden-gate, and looking up from the scene of slaughter
they saw the burly form of Mr. Challow leaning over the gate,
critically surveying their performance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis well for `ee to stand there and glane!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. ``Owing
to your being late the meat is blooded and half spoiled! <div class="bookquote">``Twon't
fetch so much by a shilling a score!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Challow</b></font>)</div><p/>Challow expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) contrition. <div class="bookquote">``You should have waited a bit''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) head, ``and not have done this--in the delicate
state, too, that you be in at present, ma'am. <div class="bookquote">``Tis risking yourself
too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't be concerned about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella, laughing.
Jude too laughed, but there was a strong flavour of bitterness in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) amusement.

<p/>Challow made up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) neglect of the killing by zeal in the
scalding and scraping. Jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man
at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had done, though aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lack of common sense, and
that the deed would have amounted to the same thing if carried out by
deputy. The white snow, stained with the blood of his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) fellow-mortal,
wore an illogical look to him (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) as a lover of justice, not to say a
Christian; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could not see how the matter was to be mended. No
doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) wife had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), a tender-hearted fool.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) did not like the road to Alfredston now. It stared him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) cynically
in the face. The wayside objects reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
courtship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) wife that, to keep them out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
read whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) walked to and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) work. Yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) sometimes felt that by caring for books he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was not escaping
common-place nor gaining rare ideas, every working-man being of that
taste now. When passing near the spot by the stream on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had
first made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) acquaintance he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) one day heard voices just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had
done at that earlier time. One of the girls who had been Arabella's
companions was talking to a friend in a shed, himself being the
subject of discourse, possibly because they had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) in the
distance. They were quite unaware that the shed-walls were so thin
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) could hear their words as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) passed.

<p/>``Howsomever, 'twas I put her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up to it! ``Nothing venture nothing
have,<div class="bookquote">'' I said. If I hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d no more have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) mis`ess than
I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis my belief she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew there was nothing the matter when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>What had Arabella been put up to by this woman, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) should
make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``mis`ess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>otherwise wife? The suggestion was horridly
unpleasant, and it rankled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) mind so much that instead of
entering his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) own cottage when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) reached it he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) basket
inside the garden-gate and passed on, determined to go and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
old aunt and get some supper there.

<p/>This made his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) arrival home rather late. Arabella however, was busy
melting down lard from fat of the deceased pig, for she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had been out
on a jaunt all day, and so delayed her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) work. Dreading lest what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
had heard should lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) to say something regrettable to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
spoke little. But Arabella was very talkative, and said among other
things that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wanted some money. Seeing the book sticking out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) pocket she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) ought to earn more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An apprentice's wages are not meant to be enough to keep a wife on,
as a rule, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you shouldn't have had one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Arabella! That's too bad, when you know how it came about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll declare afore Heaven that I thought what I told you was true.
Doctor Vilbert thought so. It was a good job for you that it wasn't
so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said hastily. <div class="bookquote">``I mean before that time.
I know it was not your fault; but those women friends of yours gave
you bad advice. If they hadn't, or you hadn't taken it, we should at
this moment have been free from a bond which, not to mince matters,
galls both of us devilishly. It may be very sad, but it is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's been telling you about my friends? What advice? I insist
upon you telling me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh--I'd rather not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you shall--you ought to. It is mean of `ee not to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) hinted gently what had been revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``But I don't wish to dwell upon it. Let us say no more about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) defensive manner collapsed. <div class="bookquote">``That was nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said,
laughing coldly. <div class="bookquote">``Every woman has a right to do such as that. The
risk is hers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite deny it, Bella. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) might if no lifelong penalty attached
to it for the man, or, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) default, for herself; if the weakness

But when effects stretch so far she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) should not go and do that which
entraps a man if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is honest, or herself if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What ought I to have done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Given me time... Why do you fuss yourself about melting down that

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I must do it to-morrow morning. It won't keep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--do.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>XI


<p/>Next morning, which was Sunday, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) resumed operations about ten
o'clock; and the renewed work recalled the conversation which had
accompanied it the night before, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) back into the same
intractable temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the story about me in Marygreen, is it--that I entrapped `ee?
Much of a catch you were, Lord send!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) warmed she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) saw some of
Jude's dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have
been laid. <div class="bookquote">``I won't have them books here in the way!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cried
petulantly; and seizing them one by one she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) began throwing them upon
the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave my books alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You might have thrown them
aside if you had liked, but as to soiling them like that, it is
disgusting!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>In the operation of making lard Arabella's hands had
become smeared with the hot grease, and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) fingers consequently
left very perceptible imprints on the book-covers. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) continued
deliberately to toss the books severally upon the floor, till Jude,
incensed beyond bearing, caught her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) by the arms to make her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) leave
off. Somehow, in going so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) loosened the fastening of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hair,
and it rolled about her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Promise to leave the books alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Let me go!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Promise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After a pause: <div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude relinquished his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hold, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) crossed the room to the door,
out of which she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) went with a set face, and into the highway. Here
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) began to saunter up and down, perversely pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hair into a
worse disorder than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had caused, and unfastening several buttons of
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) gown. It was a fine Sunday morning, dry, clear and frosty, and
the bells of Alfredston Church could be heard on the breeze from the
north. People were going along the road, dressed in their holiday
clothes; they were mainly lovers--such pairs as Jude and Arabella
had been when they sported along the same track some months earlier.
These pedestrians turned to stare at the extraordinary spectacle she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
now presented, bonnetless, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) dishevelled hair blowing in the wind,
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) bodice apart, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) sleeves rolled above her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) elbows for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) work,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hands reeking with melted fat. One of the passers said in
mock terror: <div class="bookquote">``Good Lord deliver us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s served me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Making me work Sunday mornings
when I ought to be going to my church, and tearing my hair off my
head, and my gown off my back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude was exasperated, and went out to drag her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) in by main force.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) suddenly lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heat. Illuminated with the sense that all
was over between them, and that it mattered not what she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) husband stood still, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). Their lives were ruined, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
thought; ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union:
that of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling
which had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render
a lifelong comradeship tolerable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to ill-use me on principle, as your father ill-used your
mother, and your father's sister ill-used her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``All you be a queer lot as husbands and wives!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude fixed an arrested, surprised look on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said no more,
and continued her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) saunter till she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was tired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) left the spot, and,
after wandering vaguely a little while, walked in the direction of
Marygreen. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) called upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) great-aunt, whose infirmities
daily increased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt--did my father ill-use my mother, and my aunt her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) husband?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude abruptly, sitting down by the fire.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) ancient eyes under the rim of the by-gone bonnet that
she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) always wore. <div class="bookquote">``Who's been telling you that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard it spoken of, and want to know all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You med so well, I s`pose; though your wife--I reckon 'twas
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--must have been a fool to open up that! There isn't much to know
after all. Your father and mother couldn't get on together, and they
parted. It was coming home from Alfredston market, when you were a
baby--on the hill by the Brown House barn--that they had their last
difference, and took leave of one another for the last time. Your
mother soon afterwards died--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) drowned herself, in short, and your
father went away with you to South Wessex, and never came here any
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) father's silence about North Wessex and Jude's
mother, never speaking of either till his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dying day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was the same with your father's sister. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband offended
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so disliked living with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) afterwards that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went
away to London with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) little maid. The Fawleys were not made for
wedlock: it never seemed to sit well upon us. There's sommat in our
blood that won't take kindly to the notion of being bound to do what
we do readily enough if not bound. That's why you ought to have
hearkened to me, and not ha' married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did Father and Mother part--by the Brown House, did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little further on--where the road to Fenworth branches off, and
the handpost stands. A gibbet once stood there not onconnected with
our history. But let that be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>In the dusk of that evening Jude walked away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old aunt's as
if to go home. But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reached the open down he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) struck out
upon it till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) came to a large round pond. The frost continued,
though it was not particularly sharp, and the larger stars overhead
came out slow and flickering. Jude put one foot on the edge of the
ice, and then the other: it cracked under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) weight; but this did
not deter him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ploughed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) way inward to the centre, the ice
making sharp noises as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went. When just about the middle he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) and gave a jump. The cracking repeated itself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did
not go down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) jumped again, but the cracking had ceased. Jude
went back to the edge, and stepped upon the ground.

<p/>It was curious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reserved for? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) supposed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide. Peaceful
death abhorred him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as a subject, and would not take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) do of a lower kind than self-extermination; what was
there less noble, more in keeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) present degraded position?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could get drunk. Of course that was it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had forgotten.
Drinking was the regular, stereotyped resource of the despairing
worthless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) began to see now why some men boozed at inns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
struck down the hill northwards and came to an obscure public-house.
On entering and sitting down the sight of the picture of Samson and
Delilah on the wall caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) to recognize the place as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>)
had visited with Arabella on that first Sunday evening of their
courtship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) called for liquor and drank briskly for an hour or
more.

<p/>Staggering homeward late that night, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) sense of
depression gone, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) head fairly clear still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) began to laugh
boisterously, and to wonder how Arabella would receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
new aspect. The house was in darkness when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) entered, and in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) stumbling state it was some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) could get a light.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) found that, though the marks of pig-dressing, of fats and
scallops, were visible, the materials themselves had been taken away.
A line written by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) wife on the inside of an old envelope was
pinned to the cotton blower of the fireplace:

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Have gone to my friends. Shall not return._''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>All the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) remained at home, and sent off the carcase of the
pig to Alfredston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) then cleaned up the premises, locked the door,
put the key in a place she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would know if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came back, and returned
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) masonry at Alfredston.

<p/>At night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) again plodded home he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not visited the
house. The next day went in the same way, and the next. Then there
came a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>That she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had gone tired of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) frankly admitted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) was such
a slow old coach, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not care for the sort of life he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
led. There was no prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) ever bettering himself or her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) further went on to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) parents had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) knew, for
some time considered the question of emigrating to Australia, the
pig-jobbing business being a poor one nowadays. They had at last
decided to go, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) proposed to go with them, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had no
objection. A woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sort would have more chance over there
than in this stupid country.

<p/>Jude replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had not the least objection to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) going. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
thought it a wise course, since she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished to go, and one that might
be to the advantage of both. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) enclosed in the packet containing
the letter the money that had been realized by the sale of the pig,
with all he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had besides, which was not much.

<p/>From that day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heard no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) except indirectly, though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) household did not immediately leave, but waited till
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) goods and other effects had been sold off. When Jude learnt
that there was to be an auction at the house of the Donns he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) packed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own household goods into a waggon, and sent them to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at the
aforesaid homestead, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might sell them with the rest, or as
many of them as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should choose.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) then went into lodgings at Alfredston, and saw in a shopwindow the
little handbill announcing the sale of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) father-in-law's furniture.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) noted its date, which came and passed without Jude's going near
the place, or perceiving that the traffic out of Alfredston by
the southern road was materially increased by the auction. A few
days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) entered a dingy broker's shop in the main street
of the town, and amid a heterogeneous collection of saucepans, a
clothes-horse, rolling-pin, brass candlestick, swing looking-glass,
and other things at the back of the shop, evidently just brought in
from a sale, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) perceived a framed photograph, which turned out to be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own portrait.

<p/>It was one which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had had specially taken and framed by a local man
in bird's-eye maple, as a present for Arabella, and had duly given
her (<font color='blue'><b>broker</b></font>) on their wedding-day. On the back was still to be read, <div class="bookquote">''_Jude
to Arabella_,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>with the date. She (<font color='blue'><b>broker</b></font>) must have thrown it in with the
rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>broker</b></font>) property at the auction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>the broker</b></font>)</div>said the broker, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) look at this and the other articles
in the heap, and not perceiving that the portrait was of himself,
<div class="bookquote">``It is a small lot of stuff that was knocked down to me at a cottage
sale out on the road to Marygreen. The frame is a very useful one,
if you take out the likeness. You shall have it for a shilling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The utter death of every tender sentiment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) wife, as brought
home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) by this mute and undesigned evidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sale of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) portrait and gift, was the conclusive little stroke required
to demolish all sentiment in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) paid the shilling, took the
photograph away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), and burnt it, frame and all, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) lodging.

<p/>Two or three days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) heard that Arabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) parents had
departed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had sent a message offering to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for a formal
leave-taking, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had said that it would be better otherwise,
since she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was bent on going, which perhaps was true. On the evening
following their emigration, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) day's work was done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) came out
of doors after supper, and strolled in the starlight along the too
familiar road towards the upland whereon had been experienced the
chief emotions of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) life. It seemed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) own again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) could not realize himself. On the old track he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) seemed to be a
boy still, hardly a day older than when he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had stood dreaming at the
top of that hill, inwardly fired for the first time with ardours for
Christminster and scholarship. <div class="bookquote">``Yet I am a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have
a wife. More, I have arrived at the still riper stage of having
disagreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), had a scuffle with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and parted
from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) remembered then that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was standing not far from the spot at
which the parting between his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) mother was said to have
occurred.

<p/>A little further on was the summit whence Christminster, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
had taken for that city, had seemed to be visible. A milestone, now
as always, stood at the roadside hard by. Jude drew near it, and
felt rather than read the mileage to the city. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remembered that
once on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) way home he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had proudly cut with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) keen new chisel an
inscription on the back of that milestone, embodying his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aspirations.
It had been done in the first week of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) apprenticeship, before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had been diverted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) purposes by an unsuitable woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
wondered if the inscription were legible still, and going to the back
of the milestone brushed away the nettles. By the light of a match
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could still discern what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had cut so enthusiastically so long
ago:


<p/>THITHER
J. F.
-LSB-with a pointing finger-RSB-


<p/>The sight of it, unimpaired, within its screen of grass and nettles,
lit in his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) soul a spark of the old fire. Surely his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) plan should
be to move onward through good and ill--to avoid morbid sorrow
even though he (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) did see uglinesses in the world? _Bene agere et
loetari_--to do good cheerfully--which he (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) had heard to be the
philosophy of one Spinoza, might be his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) own even now.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) might battle with his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) evil star, and follow out his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) original
intention.

<p/>By moving to a spot a little way off he (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) uncovered the horizon in a
north-easterly direction. There actually rose the faint halo, a
small dim nebulousness, hardly recognizable save by the eye of faith.
It was enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) would go to Christminster as soon as the
term of his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) apprenticeship expired.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) lodgings in a better mood, and said his (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) prayers.

<p/>AT CHRISTMINSTER

<p/>I


<p/>The next noteworthy move in Jude's life was that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) appeared
gliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three
years' later leafage than had graced his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) courtship of Arabella,
and the disruption of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) coarse conjugal life with her (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was
walking towards Christminster City, at a point a mile or two to the
south-west of it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) apprenticeship, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tools at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) back seemed
to be in the way of making a new start--the start to which, barring
the interruption involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) intimacy and married experience with
Arabella, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had been looking forward for about ten years.

<p/>Jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible,
meditative, and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was of dark complexion, with dark harmonizing eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wore
a closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) age; this, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) great mass of black curly hair, was some
trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in combing and washing out the stone-dust that settled
on it in the pursuit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) trade. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) capabilities in the latter,
having been acquired in the country, were of an all-round sort,
including monumental stone-cutting, gothic free-stone work for the
restoration of churches, and carving of a general kind. In London
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would probably have become specialized and have made himself a
<div class="bookquote">``moulding mason,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>a <div class="bookquote">``foliage sculptor'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--perhaps a <div class="bookquote">``statuary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had that afternoon driven in a cart from Alfredston to the village
nearest the city in this direction, and was now walking the remaining
four miles rather from choice than from necessity, having always
fancied himself arriving thus.

<p/>The ultimate impulse to come had had a curious origin--one more
nearly related to the emotional side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) than to the intellectual,
as is often the case with young men. One day while in lodgings at
Alfredston he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had gone to Marygreen to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old aunt, and had
observed between the brass candlesticks on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mantlepiece the
photograph of a pretty girlish face, in a broad hat with radiating
folds under the brim like the rays of a halo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had asked who she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
was. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) grand-aunt had gruffly replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin
Sue Bridehead, of the inimical branch of the family; and on further
questioning the old woman had replied that the girl lived in
Christminster, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know where, or what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was doing.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) the photograph. But it haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>); and
ultimately formed a quickening ingredient in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) latent intent of
following his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) friend the school master thither.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity,
and obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) first near view of the city. Grey-stoned and
dun-roofed, it stood within hail of the Wessex border, and almost
with the tip of one small toe within it, at the northernmost point of
the crinkled line along which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields
of that ancient kingdom. The buildings now lay quiet in the sunset,
a vane here and there on their many spires and domes giving sparkle
to a picture of sober secondary and tertiary hues.

<p/>Reaching the bottom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) moved along the level way between pollard
willows growing indistinct in the twilight, and soon confronted the
outmost lamps of the town--some of those lamps which had sent into
the sky the gleam and glory that caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) strained gaze in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) days
of dreaming, so many years ago. They winked their yellow eyes at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
dubiously, and as if, though they had been awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) all these
years in disappointment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tarrying, they did not much want him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
now.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was a species of Dick Whittington whose spirit was touched to
finer issues than a mere material gain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) went along the outlying
streets with the cautious tread of an explorer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) saw nothing of
the real city in the suburbs on this side. His (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) first want being a
lodging he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) scrutinized carefully such localities as seemed to offer
on inexpensive terms the modest type of accommodation he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) demanded;
and after inquiry took a room in a suburb nicknamed <div class="bookquote">``Beersheba,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>though he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) did not know this at the time. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) installed himself,
and having had some tea sallied forth.

<p/>It was a windy, whispering, moonless night. To guide himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>)
opened under a lamp a map he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) had brought. The breeze ruffled and
fluttered it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) could see enough to decide on the direction he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>)
should take to reach the heart of the place.

<p/>After many turnings he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) came up to the first ancient mediæval pile
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) had encountered. It was a college, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) could see by the
gateway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) entered it, walked round, and penetrated to dark corners
which no lamplight reached. Close to this college was another; and
a little further on another; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) began to be encircled as it
were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>)
passed objects out of harmony with its general expression he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) allowed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) eyes to slip over them as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) did not see them.

<p/>A bell began clanging, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) listened till a hundred-and-one strokes
had sounded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) must have made a mistake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) thought: it was meant
for a hundred.

<p/>When the gates were shut, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) could no longer get into the
quadrangles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) rambled under the walls and doorways, feeling with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) fingers the contours of their mouldings and carving. The minutes
passed, fewer and fewer people were visible, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) serpentined
among the shadows, for had he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) not imagined these scenes through
ten bygone years, and what mattered a night's rest for once? High
against the black sky the flash of a lamp would show crocketed
pinnacles and indented battlements. Down obscure alleys, apparently
never trodden now by the foot of man, and whose very existence seemed
to be forgotten, there would jut into the path porticoes, oriels,
doorways of enriched and florid middle-age design, their extinct air
being accentuated by the rottenness of the stones. It seemed
impossible that modern thought could house itself in such decrepit
and superseded chambers.

<p/>Knowing not a human being here, Jude began to be impressed with
the isolation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own personality, as with a self-spectre, the
sensation being that of one who walked but could not make himself
seen or heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) breath pensively, and, seeming thus
almost his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own ghost, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thoughts to the other ghostly
presences with which the nooks were haunted.

<p/>During the interval of preparation for this venture, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife
and furniture's uncompromising disappearance into space, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had read
and learnt almost all that could be read and learnt by one in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
position, of the worthies who had spent their youth within these
reverend walls, and whose souls had haunted them in their maturer
age. Some of them, by the accidents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reading, loomed out in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest. The
brushings of the wind against the angles, buttresses, and door-jambs
were as the passing of these only other inhabitants, the tappings
of each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their
mournful souls, the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement,
making him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) comrades in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) solitude. In the gloom it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
ran against them without feeling their bodily frames.

<p/>The streets were now deserted, but on account of these things he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
could not go in. There were poets abroad, of early date and of late,
from the friend and eulogist of Shakespeare down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) who has
recently passed into silence, and that musical one of the tribe who
is still among us. Speculative philosophers drew along, not always
with wrinkled foreheads and hoary hair as in framed portraits, but
pink-faced, slim, and active as in youth; modern divines sheeted in
their surplices, among whom the most real to Jude Fawley were the
founders of the religious school called Tractarian; the well-known
three, the enthusiast, the poet, and the formularist, the echoes
of whose teachings had influenced him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) even in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) obscure home.
A start of aversion appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) fancy to move them at sight of
those other sons of the place, the form in the full-bottomed wig,
statesman, rake, reasoner, and sceptic; the smoothly shaven historian
so ironically civil to Christianity; with others of the same
incredulous temper, who knew each quad as well as the faithful, and
took equal freedom in haunting its cloisters.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) regarded the statesmen in their various types, men of firmer
movement and less dreamy air; the scholar, the speaker, the plodder;
the man whose mind grew with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) growth in years, and the man whose
mind contracted with the same.

<p/>The scientists and philologists followed on in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind-sight in
an odd impossible combination, men of meditative faces, strained
foreheads, and weak-eyed as bats with constant research;
then official characters--such men as governor-generals and
lord-lieutenants, in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took little interest; chief-justices and
lord chancellors, silent thin-lipped figures of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew barely
the names. A keener regard attached to the prelates, by reason of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own former hopes. Of them he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had an ample band--some men of
heart, others rather men of head; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who apologized for the Church
in Latin; the saintly author of the Evening Hymn; and near them the
great itinerant preacher, hymn-writer, and zealot, shadowed like Jude
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) matrimonial difficulties.

<p/>Jude found himself speaking out loud, holding conversations with
them as it were, like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the
audience on the other side of the footlights; till he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) suddenly ceased
with a start at his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) absurdity. Perhaps those incoherent words of the
wanderer were heard within the walls by some student or thinker over
his (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) lamp; and he (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) may have raised his (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) head, and wondered what voice it
was, and what it betokened. Jude now perceived that, so far as solid
flesh went, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had the whole aged city to himself with the exception
of a belated townsman here and there, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed to be
catching a cold.

<p/>A voice reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) out of the shade; a real and local voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been a-settin' a long time on that plinth-stone, young man.
What med you be up to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It came from a policeman who had been observing Jude without the
latter observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>Jude went home and to bed, after reading up a little about these men
and their several messages to the world from a book or two that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) concerning the sons of the university. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
drew towards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
just been conning seemed spoken by them in muttering utterances;
some audible, some unintelligible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). One of the spectres -LRB-who
afterwards mourned Christminster as <div class="bookquote">``the home of lost causes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>though
Jude did not remember this-RRB- was now apostrophizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautiful city! so venerable, so lovely, so unravaged by the fierce
intellectual life of our century, so serene! ... Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ineffable charm
keeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to
perfection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Another voice was that of the Corn Law convert, whose phantom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
just seen in the quadrangle with a great bell. Jude thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) soul
might have been shaping the historic words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) master-speech:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I may be wrong, but my impression is that my duty towards a
country threatened with famine requires that that which has been the
ordinary remedy under all similar circumstances should be resorted to
now, namely, that there should be free access to the food of man from
whatever quarter it may come... Deprive me of office to-morrow, you
can never deprive me of the consciousness that I have exercised the
powers committed to me from no corrupt or interested motives, from no
desire to gratify ambition, for no personal gain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the sly author of the immortal Chapter on Christianity: <div class="bookquote">``How
shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic
world, to those evidences -LSB-miracles-RSB- which were presented by
Omnipotence? ... The sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from the
awful spectacle, and appeared unconscious of any alterations in the
moral or physical government of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the shade of the poet, the last of the optimists:


<p/>How the world is made for each of us!

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>And each of the Many helps to recruit
The life of the race by a general plan.


<p/>Then one of the three enthusiasts he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) had seen just now, the author of
the _Apologia_:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My argument was ... that absolute certitude as to the truths of
natural theology was the result of an assemblage of concurring and
converging probabilities ... that probabilities which did not reach
to logical certainty might create a mental certitude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div><p/>The second of them, no polemic, murmured quieter things:


<p/>Why should we faint, and fear to live alone,
Since all alone, so Heaven has will'd, we die?


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) likewise heard some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short
face, the genial Spectator:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I look upon the tombs of the great, every motion of envy dies
in me; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate
desire goes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a
tombstone, my heart melts with compassion; when I see the tombs of
the parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for those
whom we must quickly follow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>And lastly a gentle-voiced prelate spoke, during whose meek, familiar
rhyme, endeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) from earliest childhood, Jude fell asleep:


<p/>Teach me to live, that I may dread
The grave as little as my bed.
Teach me to die ...


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not wake till morning. The ghostly past seemed to have gone,
and everything spoke of to-day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) started up in bed, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had overslept himself and then said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove--I had quite forgotten my sweet-faced cousin, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>parents</b></font>)'s
here all the time! ... and my old schoolmaster, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) words
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) schoolmaster had, perhaps, less zest in them than his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) words
concerning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin.



<p/>II


<p/>Necessary meditations on the actual, including the mean
bread-and-cheese question, dissipated the phantasmal for a while, and
compelled Jude to smother high thinkings under immediate needs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had to get up, and seek for work, manual work; the only kind deemed
by many of its professors to be work at all.

<p/>Passing out into the streets on this errand he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found that the
colleges had treacherously changed their sympathetic countenances:
some were pompous; some had put on the look of family vaults above
ground; something barbaric loomed in the masonries of all. The
spirits of the great men had disappeared.

<p/>The numberless architectural pages around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) read, naturally,
less as an artist-critic of their forms than as an artizan and
comrade of the dead handicraftsmen whose muscles had actually
executed those forms. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) examined the mouldings, stroked them as
one who knew their beginning, said they were difficult or easy in
the working, had taken little or much time, were trying to the arm,
or convenient to the tool.

<p/>What at night had been perfect and ideal was by day the more or
less defective real. Cruelties, insults, had, he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) perceived, been
inflicted on the aged erections. The condition of several moved him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>)
as he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) would have been moved by maimed sentient beings. They were
wounded, broken, sloughing off their outer shape in the deadly
struggle against years, weather, and man.

<p/>The rottenness of these historical documents reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
not, after all, hastening on to begin the morning practically as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had intended. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come to work, and to live by work, and the
morning had nearly gone. It was, in one sense, encouraging to think
that in a place of crumbling stones there must be plenty for one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trade to do in the business of renovation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to
the workyard of the stone-mason whose name had been given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at
Alfredston; and soon heard the familiar sound of the rubbers and
chisels.

<p/>The yard was a little centre of regeneration. Here, with keen edges
and smooth curves, were forms in the exact likeness of those he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
seen abraded and time-eaten on the walls. These were the ideas in
modern prose which the lichened colleges presented in old poetry.
Even some of those antiques might have been called prose when they
were new. They had done nothing but wait, and had become poetical.
How easy to the smallest building; how impossible to most men.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked for the foreman, and looked round among the new traceries,
mullions, transoms, shafts, pinnacles, and battlements standing on
the bankers half worked, or waiting to be removed. They were marked
by precision, mathematical straightness, smoothness, exactitude:
there in the old walls were the broken lines of the original idea;
jagged curves, disdain of precision, irregularity, disarray.

<p/>For a moment there fell on Jude a true illumination; that here in the
stone yard was a centre of effort as worthy as that dignified by the
name of scholarly study within the noblest of the colleges. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
lost it under stress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would accept any employment
which might be offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) on the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) late employer's
recommendation; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would accept it as a provisional thing only.
This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) form of the modern vice of unrest.

<p/>Moreover he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) perceived that at best only copying, patching and
imitating went on here; which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fancied to be owing to some
temporary and local cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not at that time see that
mediævalism was as dead as a fern-leaf in a lump of coal; that other
developments were shaping in the world around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), in which Gothic
architecture and its associations had no place. The deadly animosity
of contemporary logic and vision towards so much of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) held in
reverence was not yet revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>Having failed to obtain work here as yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went away, and thought
again of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin, whose presence somewhere at hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed to
feel in wavelets of interest, if not of emotion. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had that pretty portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)! At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt to
send it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did so, with a request, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was not to
bring disturbance into the family by going to see the girl or her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
relations. Jude, a ridiculously affectionate fellow, promised
nothing, put the photograph on the mantel-piece, kissed it--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did
not know why--and felt more at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to look down and
preside over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tea. It was cheering--the one thing uniting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to
the emotions of the living city.

<p/>There remained the schoolmaster--probably now a reverend parson.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) could not possibly hunt up such a respectable man just yet;
so raw and unpolished was his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) condition, so precarious were his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
fortunes. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) still remained in loneliness. Although people
moved round him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) virtually saw none. Not as yet having mingled
with the active life of the place it was largely non-existent to him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>).
But the saints and prophets in the window-tracery, the paintings
in the galleries, the statues, the busts, the gargoyles, the
corbel-heads--these seemed to breathe his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) atmosphere. Like all
newcomers to a spot on which the past is deeply graven he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) heard that
past announcing itself with an emphasis altogether unsuspected by,
and even incredible to, the habitual residents.

<p/>For many days he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) haunted the cloisters and quadrangles of the
colleges at odd minutes in passing them, surprised by impish
echoes of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) own footsteps, smart as the blows of a mallet. The
Christminster <div class="bookquote">``sentiment,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as it had been called, ate further and
further into him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>); till he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) probably knew more about those buildings
materially, artistically, and historically, than any one of their
inmates.

<p/>It was not till now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) found himself actually on the spot of
his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) enthusiasm, that Jude perceived how far away from the object of
that enthusiasm he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) really was. Only a wall divided him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) from those
happy young contemporaries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) shared a common mental
life; men who had nothing to do from morning till night but to read,
mark, learn, and inwardly digest. Only a wall--but what a wall!

<p/>Every day, every hour, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went in search of labour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw them
going and coming also, rubbed shoulders with them, heard their
voices, marked their movements. The conversation of some of the
more thoughtful among them seemed oftentimes, owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) long and
persistent preparation for this place, to be peculiarly akin to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
own thoughts. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was as far from them as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had been at the
antipodes. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was a young workman in a white
blouse, and with stone-dust in the creases of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) clothes; and in
passing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) they did not even see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), or hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), rather saw
through him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as through a pane of glass at their familiars beyond.
Whatever they were to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to them was not on the spot at all; and
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would be close to their lives by coming there.

<p/>But the future lay ahead after all; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could only be so
fortunate as to get into good employment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would put up with the
inevitable. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thanked God for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) health and strength, and took
courage. For the present he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was outside the gates of everything,
colleges included: perhaps some day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would be inside. Those
palaces of light and leading; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might some day look down on the
world through their panes.

<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did receive a message from the stone-mason's yard--that
a job was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) first encouragement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
closed with the offer promptly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was young and strong, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) never could have executed with such
zest the undertakings to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now applied himself, since they
involved reading most of the night after working all the day. First
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) bought a shaded lamp for four and six-pence, and obtained a good
light. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) got pens, paper, and such other necessary books as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had been unable to obtain elsewhere. Then, to the consternation of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) landlady, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) shifted all the furniture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) room--a single one
for living and sleeping--rigged up a curtain on a rope across the
middle, to make a double chamber out of one, hung up a thick blind
that nobody should know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was curtailing the hours of sleep,
laid out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) books, and sat down.

<p/>Having been deeply encumbered by marrying, getting a cottage, and
buying the furniture which had disappeared in the wake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had never been able to save any money since the time of those
disastrous ventures, and till his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wages began to come in he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was
obliged to live in the narrowest way. After buying a book or two
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not even afford himself a fire; and when the nights reeked
with the raw and cold air from the Meadows he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lamp in
a great-coat, hat, and woollen gloves.

<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) window he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could perceive the spire of the cathedral, and the
ogee dome under which resounded the great bell of the city. The tall
tower, tall belfry windows, and tall pinnacles of the college by the
bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could also get a glimpse of by going to the staircase.
These objects he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) used as stimulants when his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) faith in the future was
dim.

<p/>Like enthusiasts in general he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) made no inquiries into details of
procedure. Picking up general notions from casual acquaintance, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
never dwelt upon them. For the present, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said to himself, the one
thing necessary was to get ready by accumulating money and knowledge,
and await whatever chances were afforded to such an one of becoming
a son of the University. <div class="bookquote">``For wisdom is a defence, and money is a
defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life
to them that have it.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) desire absorbed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and left no part of
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to weigh its practicability.

<p/>At this time he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) received a nervously anxious letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) poor old
aunt, on the subject which had previously distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)--a fear that
Jude would not be strong-minded enough to keep away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin
Sue Bridehead and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) relations. Sue's father, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) aunt believed,
had gone back to London, but the girl remained at Christminster. To
make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still more objectionable, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was an artist or designer of
some sort in what was called an ecclesiastical warehouse, which was
a perfect seed-bed of idolatry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was no doubt abandoned to
mummeries on that account--if not quite a Papist. -LRB-Miss Drusilla
Fawley was of her (<font color='blue'><b>Drusilla</b></font>) date, Evangelical.-RRB-

<p/>As Jude was rather on an intellectual track than a theological, this
news of Sue's probable opinions did not much influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) one way or
the other, but the clue to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) whereabouts was decidedly interesting.
With an altogether singular pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) earliest spare
minutes past the shops answering to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) great-aunt's description; and
beheld in one of them a young girl sitting behind a desk, who was
suspiciously like the original of the portrait. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ventured to enter
on a trivial errand, and having made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) purchase lingered on the
scene. The shop seemed to be kept entirely by women. It contained
Anglican books, stationery, texts, and fancy goods: little plaster
angels on brackets, Gothic-framed pictures of saints, ebony crosses
that were almost crucifixes, prayer-books that were almost missals.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt very shy of looking at the girl in the desk; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so
pretty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not believe it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should belong
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke to one of the two older women behind the
counter; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) recognized in the accents certain qualities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
own voice; softened and sweetened, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doing?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stole a glance round. Before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay a piece of zinc, cut to
the shape of a scroll three or four feet long, and coated with a
dead-surface paint on one side. Hereon she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was designing or
illuminating, in characters of Church text, the single word


<p/>A L L E L U J A


<p/><div class="bookquote">``A sweet, saintly, Christian business, hers!''  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presence here was now fairly enough explained, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) skill in
work of this sort having no doubt been acquired from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's
occupation as an ecclesiastical worker in metal. The lettering on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was engaged was clearly intended to be fixed up in some
chancel to assist devotion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) came out. It would have been easy to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) there and then,
but it seemed scarcely honourable towards his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) aunt to disregard her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
request so incontinently. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had used him (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) roughly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) up: and the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) being powerless to control him (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>)
lent a pathetic force to a wish that would have been inoperative as
an argument.

<p/>So Jude gave no sign. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would not call upon Sue just yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
other reasons against doing so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had walked away. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) seemed
so dainty beside himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) rough working-jacket and dusty
trousers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was as yet unready to encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had felt about Mr. Phillotson. And how possible it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had
inherited the antipathies of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) family, and would scorn him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), as
far as a Christian could, particularly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) that
unpleasant part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) history which had resulted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) becoming
enchained to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own sex whom she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would certainly not admire.

<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) kept watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and liked to feel she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was there.
The consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) living presence stimulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
remained more or less an ideal character, about whose form he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) began
to weave curious and fantastic day-dreams.

<p/>Between two and three weeks afterwards Jude was engaged with some
more men, outside Crozier College in Old-time Street, in getting a
block of worked freestone from a waggon across the pavement, before
hoisting it to the parapet which they were repairing. Standing in
position the head man said, <div class="bookquote">``Spaik when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) heave! He-ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>the head man</b></font>)</div>And they
heaved.

<p/>All of a sudden, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifted, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin stood close to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow,
pausing a moment on the bend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) foot till the obstructing object
should have been removed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked right into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face with
liquid, untranslatable eyes, that combined, or seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
combine, keenness with tenderness, and mystery with both, their
expression, as well as that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lips, taking its life from some
words just spoken to a companion, and being carried on into his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) face
quite unconsciously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) no more observed his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) presence than that of
the dust-motes which his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) manipulations raised into the sunbeams.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) closeness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was so suggestive that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) trembled, and turned
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) face away with a shy instinct to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>),
though as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had never once seen him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not possibly do so;
and might very well never have heard even his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) name. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could
perceive that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was a country-girl at bottom, a latter
girlhood of some years in London, and a womanhood here, had taken
all rawness out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was gone he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) work, reflecting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had
been so caught by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) influence that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had taken no count of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
general mould and build. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) remembered now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was not a large
figure, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was light and slight, of the type dubbed elegant.
That was about all he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had seen. There was nothing statuesque in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>);
all was nervous motion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was mobile, living, yet a painter might
not have called her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) handsome or beautiful. But the much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was
surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was quite a long way removed from the rusticity
that was his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>). How could one of his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) cross-grained, unfortunate,
almost accursed stock, have contrived to reach this pitch of
niceness? London had done it, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) supposed.

<p/>From this moment the emotion which had been accumulating in his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)
breast as the bottled-up effect of solitude and the poetized
locality he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) dwelt in, insensibly began to precipitate itself on this
half-visionary form; and he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) perceived that, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) obedient
wish in a contrary direction, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would soon be unable to resist the
desire to make himself known to her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) affected to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) quite in a family way, since there were
crushing reasons why he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) should not and could not think of her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) in any
other.

<p/>The first reason was that he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) was married, and it would be wrong.
The second was that they were cousins. It was not well for cousins
to fall in love even when circumstances seemed to favour the passion.
The third: even were he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) free, in a family like his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) own where marriage
usually meant a tragic sadness, marriage with a blood-relation would
duplicate the adverse conditions, and a tragic sadness might be
intensified to a tragic horror.

<p/>Therefore, again, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would have to think of Sue with only a
relation's mutual interest in one belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>); regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in
a practical way as some one to be proud of; to talk and nod to;
later on, to be invited to tea by, the emotion spent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) being
rigorously that of a kinsman and well-wisher. So would she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) be to him (<font color='blue'><b>well-wisher</b></font>)
a kindly star, an elevating power, a companion in Anglican worship,
a tender friend.



<p/>III


<p/>But under the various deterrent influences Jude's instinct was to
approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) timidly, and the next Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went to the morning
service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further
view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) frequently attended there.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in the afternoon, which was
finer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) came at all she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would approach the
building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from
which it was accessible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stood in a corner while the bell was
going. A few minutes before the hour for service she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) appeared as
one of the figures walking along under the college walls, and at
sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) advanced up the side opposite, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) into
the building, more than ever glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had not as yet revealed
himself. To see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and to be himself unseen and unknown, was
enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at present.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lingered awhile in the vestibule, and the service was some way
advanced when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was put into a seat. It was a louring, mournful,
still afternoon, when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to
ordinary practical men, and not only a luxury of the emotional
and leisured classes. In the dim light and the baffling glare of
the clerestory windows he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could discern the opposite worshippers
indistinctly only, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw that Sue was among them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had not
long discovered the exact seat that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) occupied when the chanting
of the 119th Psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second
part, _In quo corriget_, the organ changing to a pathetic Gregorian
tune as the singers gave forth:


<p/>Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way?


<p/>It was the very question that was engaging Jude's attention at this
moment. What a wicked worthless fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been to give vent as
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had done to an animal passion for a woman, and allow it to lead
to such disastrous consequences; then to think of putting an end to
himself; then to go recklessly and get drunk. The great waves of
pedal music tumbled round the choir, and, nursed on the supernatural
as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been, it is not wonderful that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could hardly believe that
the psalm was not specially set by some regardful Providence for this
moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) first entry into the solemn building. And yet it was
the ordinary psalm for the twenty-fourth evening of the month.

<p/>The girl for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was beginning to nourish an extraordinary
tenderness was at this time ensphered by the same harmonies as those
which floated into his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ears; and the thought was a delight to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was probably a frequenter of this place, and, steeped body and
soul in church sentiment as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be by occupation and habit, had,
no doubt, much in common with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). To an impressionable and lonely
young man the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts, which promised to supply both social and spiritual
possibilities, was like the dew of Hermon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained throughout
the service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy.

<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was loth to suspect it, some people might have said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
that the atmosphere blew as distinctly from Cyprus as from Galilee.

<p/>Jude waited till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seat and passed under the screen
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) himself moved. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not look towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and by the
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reached the door she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was half-way down the broad path.
Being dressed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) Sunday suit he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was inclined to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
and reveal himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was not quite ready; and, alas, ought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to do so with the kind of feeling that was awakening in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)?

<p/>For though it had seemed to have an ecclesiastical basis during the
service, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had persuaded himself that such was the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
could not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was such a stranger that the kinship was affectation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``It can't be! I, a man with a wife, must not know her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Still
Sue WAS his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own kin, and the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) having a wife, even though
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not in evidence in this hemisphere, might be a help in one
sense. It would put all thought of a tender wish on his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) part out
of Sue's mind, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) intercourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) free and fearless.
It was with some heartache that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) saw how little he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) cared for the
freedom and fearlessness that would result in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) from such
knowledge.



<p/>Some little time before the date of this service in the cathedral the
pretty, liquid-eyed, light-footed young woman, Sue Bridehead, had an
afternoon's holiday, and leaving the ecclesiastical establishment in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) not only assisted but lodged, took a walk into the country
with a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) hand. It was one of those cloudless days which
sometimes occur in Wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet,
as if intercalated by caprice of the weather-god. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) went along for
a mile or two until she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) came to much higher ground than that of the
city she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) had left behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>). The road passed between green fields,
and coming to a stile Sue paused there, to finish the page she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
reading, and then looked back at the towers and domes and pinnacles
new and old.

<p/>On the other side of the stile, in the footpath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) beheld a
foreigner with black hair and a sallow face, sitting on the grass
beside a large square board whereon were fixed, as closely as they
could stand, a number of plaster statuettes, some of them bronzed,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) was re-arranging before proceeding with them on his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) way.
They were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles, and
comprised divinities of a very different character from those the
girl was accustomed to see portrayed, among them being a Venus of
standard pattern, a Diana, and, of the other sex, Apollo, Bacchus,
and Mars. Though the figures were many yards away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) the
south-west sun brought them out so brilliantly against the green
herbage that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) could discern their contours with luminous
distinctness; and being almost in a line between herself and the
church towers of the city they awoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) an oddly foreign and
contrasting set of ideas by comparison. The man rose, and, seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>), politely took off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap, and cried, <div class="bookquote">``I-i-i-mages!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>in an accent
that agreed with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance. In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dexterously lifted
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knee the great board with its assembled notabilities divine
and human, and raised it to the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, bringing them on to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) and resting the board on the stile. First he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
smaller wares--the busts of kings and queens, then a minstrel, then
a winged Cupid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much are these two?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said, touching with her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) finger the
Venus and the Apollo--the largest figures on the tray.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) should have them for ten shillings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot afford that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) offered considerably less,
and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) surprise the image-man drew them from their wire stay and
handed them over the stile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) clasped them as treasures.

<p/>When they were paid for, and the man had gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) began to be
concerned as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) should do with them. They seemed so very
large now that they were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) possession, and so very naked.
Being of a nervous temperament she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) trembled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) enterprise.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) handled them the white pipeclay came off on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) gloves and
jacket. After carrying them along a little way openly an idea came
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and, pulling some huge burdock leaves, parsley, and other
rank growths from the hedge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wrapped up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) burden as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
could in these, so that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) carried appeared to be an enormous
armful of green stuff gathered by a zealous lover of nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, anything is better than those everlasting church fallals!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
said. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was still in a trembling state, and seemed almost to
wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had not bought the figures.

<p/>Occasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that Venus's arm was
not broken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) entered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) heathen load into the most Christian
city in the country by an obscure street running parallel to the main
one, and round a corner to the side door of the establishment to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) was attached. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) purchases were taken straight up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>)
own chamber, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) at once attempted to lock them in a box that was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) very own property; but finding them too cumbersome she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) wrapped
them in large sheets of brown paper, and stood them on the floor in a
corner.

<p/>The mistress of the house, Miss Fontover, was an elderly lady in
spectacles, dressed almost like an abbess; a dab at Ritual, as become
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fontover</b></font>) business, and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of St.
Silas, in the suburb of Beersheba before-mentioned, which Jude also
had begun to attend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fontover</b></font>) was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced
circumstances, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) death, which had occurred several years
before this date, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fontover</b></font>) boldly avoided penury by taking over a little
shop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable
proportions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fontover</b></font>) wore a cross and beads round her (<font color='blue'><b>Fontover</b></font>) neck as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fontover</b></font>) only
ornament, and knew the Christian Year by heart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fontover</b></font>) now came to call Sue to tea, and, finding that the girl did not
respond for a moment, entered the room just as the other was hastily
putting a string round each parcel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something you have been buying, Miss Bridehead?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked,
regarding the enwrapped objects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--just something to ornament my room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I should have thought I had put enough here already,''  (<font color='red'><b>saints</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Fontover, looking round at the Gothic-framed prints of saints,
the Church-text scrolls, and other articles which, having become too
stale to sell, had been used to furnish this obscure chamber. <div class="bookquote">``What
is it? How bulky!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) tore a little hole, about as big as a wafer,
in the brown paper, and tried to peep in. <div class="bookquote">``Why, statuary? Two
figures? Where did you get them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I bought them of a travelling man who sells casts--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two saints?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What ones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``St. Peter and St.--St. Mary Magdalen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--now come down to tea, and go and finish that organ-text, if
there's light enough afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue zest</b></font>)</div><p/>These little obstacles to the indulgence of what had been the merest
passing fancy created in Sue a great zest for unpacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) objects
and looking at them; and at bedtime, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was sure of being
undisturbed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) unrobed the divinities in comfort. Placing the pair
of figures on the chest of drawers, a candle on each side of them,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) withdrew to the bed, flung herself down thereon, and began
reading a book she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) box, which Miss Fontover knew
nothing of. It was a volume of Gibbon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) read the chapter
dealing with the reign of Julian the Apostate. Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
looked up at the statuettes, which appeared strange and out of place,
there happening to be a Calvary print hanging between them, and,
as if the scene suggested the action, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) at length jumped up and
withdrew another book from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) box--a volume of verse--and turned to
the familiar poem--


<p/>Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean:
The world has grown grey from thy breath!


<p/>which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) read to the end. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) put out the candles,
undressed, and finally extinguished her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own light.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was of an age which usually sleeps soundly, yet to-night she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
kept waking up, and every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes there was enough
diffused light from the street to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) the white plaster figures,
standing on the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment
of text and martyr, and the Gothic-framed Crucifix-picture that was
only discernible now as a Latin cross, the figure thereon being
obscured by the shades.

<p/>On one of these occasions the church clocks struck some small hour.
It fell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>)
books at a not very distant spot in the same city. Being Saturday
night the morrow was one on which Jude had not set his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) alarm-clock to
call him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) usually early time, and hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had stayed up, as
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) custom, two or three hours later than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could afford to do
on any other day of the week. Just then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was earnestly reading
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) Griesbach's text. At the very time that Sue was tossing and
staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) figures, the policeman and belated citizens passing
along under his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) window might have heard, if they had stood still,
strange syllables mumbled with fervour within--words that had for
Jude an indescribable enchantment: inexplicable sounds something
like these:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_All hemin heis Theos ho Pater, ex hou ta panta, kai hemeis eis
auton:_''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Till the sounds rolled with reverent loudness, as a book was heard
to close:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Kai heis Kurios Iesous Christos, di hou ta panta kai hemeis di
autou!_''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>IV


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christos</b></font>) was a handy man at his (<font color='blue'><b>Christos</b></font>) trade, an all-round man, as artizans in
country-towns are apt to be. In London the man who carves the boss
or knob of leafage declines to cut the fragment of moulding which
merges in that leafage, as if it were a degradation to do the second
half of one whole. When there was not much Gothic moulding for
Jude to run, or much window-tracery on the bankers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would go out
lettering monuments or tombstones, and take a pleasure in the change
of handiwork.

<p/>The next time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was on a ladder executing
a job of this sort inside one of the churches. There was a short
morning service, and when the parson entered Jude came down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
ladder, and sat with the half-dozen people forming the congregation,
till the prayer should be ended, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tapping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
did not observe till the service was half over that one of the women
was Sue, who had perforce accompanied the elderly Miss Fontover
thither.

<p/>Jude sat watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pretty shoulders, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) easy, curiously
nonchalant risings and sittings, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) perfunctory genuflexions,
and thought what a help such an Anglican would have been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in
happier circumstances. It was not so much his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) anxiety to get on with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) work that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) go up to it immediately the worshipers began
to take their leave: it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dared not, in this holy spot,
confront the woman who was beginning to influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in such an
indescribable manner. Those three enormous reasons why he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) must
not attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead, now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind,
loomed as stubbornly as ever. But it was also obvious that man could
not live by work alone; that the particular man Jude, at any rate,
wanted something to love. Some men would have rushed incontinently
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>), snatched the pleasure of easy friendship which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) could
hardly refuse, and have left the rest to chance. Not so Jude--at
first.

<p/>But as the days, and still more particularly the lonely evenings,
dragged along, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found himself, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) moral consternation,
to be thinking more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) instead of thinking less of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>), and
experiencing a fearful bliss in doing what was erratic, informal, and
unexpected. Surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) influence all day, walking past the
spots she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) frequented, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was always thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>), and was obliged
to own to himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) conscience was likely to be the loser in
this battle.

<p/>To be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) was almost an ideality to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) still. Perhaps to know
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) would be to cure himself of this unexpected and unauthorized
passion. A voice whispered that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) desired to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
did not desire to be cured.

<p/>There was not the least doubt that from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own orthodox point of
view the situation was growing immoral. For Sue to be the loved one
of a man who was licensed by the laws of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country to love Arabella
and none other unto his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life's end, was a pretty bad second beginning
when the man was bent on such a course as Jude purposed. This
conviction was so real with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) that one day when, as was frequent,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was at work in a neighbouring village church alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt it to
be his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) duty to pray against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) weakness. But much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wished to
be an exemplar in these things he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not get on. It was quite
impossible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found, to ask to be delivered from temptation when
your heart's desire was to be tempted unto seventy times seven. So
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) excused himself. <div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is not altogether
an _erotolepsy_ that is the matter with me, as at that first time.
I can see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is exceptionally bright; and it is partly a wish
for intellectual sympathy, and a craving for loving-kindness in my
solitude.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went on adoring her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>), fearing to realize that
it was human perversity. For whatever Sue's virtues, talents, or
ecclesiastical saturation, it was certain that those items were not
at all the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>On an afternoon at this time a young girl entered the stone-mason's
yard with some hesitation, and, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) skirts to avoid draggling
them in the white dust, crossed towards the office.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a nice girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>said one of the men known as Uncle Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) about here and there. Why, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s
the daughter of that clever chap Bridehead who did all the wrought
ironwork at St. Silas' ten years ago, and went away to London
afterwards. I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>)'s doing now--not much I fancy--as
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s come back here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and asked if
Mr. Jude Fawley was at work in the yard. It so happened that Jude
had gone out somewhere or other that afternoon, which information she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
received with a look of disappointment, and went away immediately.
When Jude returned they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and described her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Why--that's my cousin Sue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked along the street after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was out of sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had no longer any thought of a conscientious avoidance of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and
resolved to call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that very evening. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reached
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lodging he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found a note from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--a first note--one of those
documents which, simple and commonplace in themselves, are seen
retrospectively to have been pregnant with impassioned consequences.
The very unconsciousness of a looming drama which is shown in such
innocent first epistles from women to men, or _vice versa_, makes
them, when such a drama follows, and they are read over by the purple
or lurid light of it, all the more impressive, solemn, and in cases,
terrible.

<p/>Sue's was of the most artless and natural kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>)
as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear cousin Jude; said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had only just learnt by the merest
accident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was living in Christminster, and reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with
not letting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) know. They might have had such nice times together,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was thrown much upon herself, and had hardly any
congenial friend. But now there was every probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soon
going away, so that the chance of companionship would be lost perhaps
for ever.

<p/>A cold sweat overspread Jude at the news that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going away.
That was a contingency he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had never thought of, and it spurred him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
to write all the more quickly to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would meet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that very
evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, one hour from the time of writing, at the cross in
the pavement which marked the spot of the Martyrdoms.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had despatched the note by a boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) regretted that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
hurry he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) should have suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) out of doors, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might have said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). It was, in fact, the
country custom to meet thus, and nothing else had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).
Arabella had been met in the same way, unfortunately, and it might
not seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue. However, it could not
be helped now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) moved towards the point a few minutes before
the hour, under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps.

<p/>The broad street was silent, and almost deserted, although it was
not late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) saw a figure on the other side, which turned out to
be hers, and they both converged towards the crossmark at the same
moment. Before either had reached it she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to meet you just there, for the first time in my
life! Come further on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The voice, though positive and silvery, had been tremulous. They
walked on in parallel lines, and, waiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pleasure, Jude watched
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) showed signs of closing in, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did likewise, the place
being where the carriers' carts stood in the daytime, though there
was none on the spot then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry that I asked you to meet me, and didn't call,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>began Jude
with the bashfulness of a lover. <div class="bookquote">``But I thought it would save time
if we were going to walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I don't mind that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said with the freedom of a friend. <div class="bookquote">``I
have really no place to ask anybody in to. What I meant was that the
place you chose was so horrid--I suppose I ought not to say horrid--I
mean gloomy and inauspicious in its associations... But isn't it
funny to begin like this, when I don't know you yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
up and down curiously, though Jude did not look much at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to know me more than I know you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I have seen you now and then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you knew who I was, and didn't speak? And now I am going away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. That's unfortunate. I have hardly any other friend. I have,
indeed, one very old friend here somewhere, but I don't quite like
to call on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) just yet. I wonder if you know anything of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--Mr.
Phillotson? A parson somewhere about the county I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I only know of one Mr. Phillotson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) lives a little way out in
the country, at Lumsdon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)'s a village schoolmaster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)'s the same. Surely it is impossible! Only a
schoolmaster still! Do you know his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) Christian name--is it Richard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--it is; I've directed books to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), though I've never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) couldn't do it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude's countenance fell, for how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) succeed in an enterprise
wherein the great Phillotson had failed? He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) would have had a day of
despair if the news had not arrived during his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) sweet Sue's presence,
but even at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had visions of how Phillotson's failure in
the grand university scheme would depress him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As we are going to take a walk, suppose we go and call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``It is not late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) agreed, and they went along up a hill, and through some prettily
wooded country. Presently the embattled tower and square turret
of the church rose into the sky, and then the school-house. They
inquired of a person in the street if Mr. Phillotson was likely to
be at home, and were informed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was always at home. A knock
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) to the school-house door, with a candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) hand and a
look of inquiry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) face, which had grown thin and careworn since
Jude last set eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>That after all these years the meeting with Mr. Phillotson should be
of this homely complexion destroyed at one stroke the halo which had
surrounded the school-master's figure in Jude's imagination ever
since their parting. It created in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at the same time a sympathy
with Phillotson as an obviously much chastened and disappointed man.
Jude told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) name, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as an old
friend who had been kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) youthful days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember you in the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>the school-master</b></font>)</div>said the school-master
thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``You were one of my pupils, you say? Yes, no doubt;
but they number so many thousands by this time of my life, and have
naturally changed so much, that I remember very few except the quite
recent ones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was out at Marygreen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had not come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I was there a short time. And is this an old pupil, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--that's my cousin... I wrote to you for some grammars, if you
recollect, and you sent them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--yes!--I do dimly recall that incident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very kind of you to do it. And it was you who first started
me on that course. On the morning you left Marygreen, when your
goods were on the waggon, you wished me good-bye, and said your
scheme was to be a university man and enter the Church--that a degree
was the necessary hall-mark of one who wanted to do anything as a
theologian or teacher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember I thought all that privately; but I wonder I did not keep
my own counsel. The idea was given up years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never forgotten it. It was that which brought me to this
part of the country, and out here to see you to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson. <div class="bookquote">``And your cousin, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They entered the parlour of the school-house, where there was a lamp
with a paper shade, which threw the light down on three or four
books. Phillotson took it off, so that they could see each other
better, and the rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious
dark eyes and hair of Sue, on the earnest features of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cousin,
and on the schoolmaster's own maturer face and figure, showing him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
to be a spare and thoughtful personage of five-and-forty, with a
thin-lipped, somewhat refined mouth, a slightly stooping habit, and
a black frock coat, which from continued frictions shone a little at
the shoulder-blades, the middle of the back, and the elbows.

<p/>The old friendship was imperceptibly renewed, the schoolmaster
speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) experiences, and the cousins of theirs. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) told them
that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) still thought of the Church sometimes, and that though he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
could not enter it as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had intended to do in former years he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might
enter it as a licentiate. Meanwhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was comfortable in
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) present position, though he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was in want of a pupil-teacher.

<p/>They did not stay to supper, Sue having to be indoors before it grew
late, and the road was retraced to Christminster. Though they had
talked of nothing more than general subjects, Jude was surprised to
find what a revelation of woman his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was so
vibrant that everything she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did seemed to have its source in feeling.
An exciting thought would make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walk ahead so fast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could
hardly keep up with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sensitiveness on some points
was such that it might have been misread as vanity. It was with
heart-sickness he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) perceived that, while her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sentiments towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
were those of the frankest friendliness only, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more than
before becoming acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and the gloom of the walk home
lay not in the night overhead, but in the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why must you leave Christminster?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said regretfully. <div class="bookquote">``How can
you do otherwise than cling to a city in whose history such men as
Newman, Pusey, Ward, Keble, loom so large!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--they do. Though how large do they loom in the history of the
world? ... What a funny reason for caring to stay! I should never
have thought of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Fontover, one of the
partners whom I serve, is offended with me, and I with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>); and it
is best to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did that happen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) broke some statuary of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh? Wilfully?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) found it in my room, and though it was my property she (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>)
threw it on the floor and stamped on it, because it was not according
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) taste, and ground the arms and the head of one of the figures
all to bits with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) heel--a horrid thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too Catholic-Apostolic for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>), I suppose? No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) called them
popish images and talked of the invocation of saints.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No... No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) didn't do that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) saw the matter quite
differently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Then I am surprised!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It was for quite some other reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) didn't like my
patron-saints. So I was led to retort upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>); and the end of it
was that I resolved not to stay, but to get into an occupation in
which I shall be more independent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you try teaching again? You once did, I heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought of resuming it; for I was getting on as an
art-designer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``DO let me ask Mr. Phillotson to let you try your hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
school? If you like it, and go to a training college, and become a
first-class certificated mistress, you get twice as large an income
as any designer or church artist, and twice as much freedom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--ask him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>). Now I must go in. Good-bye, dear Jude! I am so
glad we have met at last. We needn't quarrel because our parents
did, need we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude did not like to let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) see quite how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) way to the remote street in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lodging.

<p/>To keep Sue Bridehead near him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was now a desire which operated
without regard of consequences, and the next evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) again set out
for Lumsdon, fearing to trust to the persuasive effects of a note
only. The school-master was unprepared for such a proposal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I rather wanted was a second year's transfer, as it is called,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Of course your cousin would do, personally; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has
had no experience. Oh--she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has, has she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) really think of
adopting teaching as a profession?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was disposed to do so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ingenious
arguments on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) natural fitness for assisting Mr. Phillotson, of
which Jude knew nothing whatever, so influenced the schoolmaster that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), assuring Jude as a friend that unless
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin really meant to follow on in the same course, and regarded
this step as the first stage of an apprenticeship, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
training in a normal school would be the second stage, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) time would
be wasted quite, the salary being merely nominal.

<p/>The day after this visit Phillotson received a letter from Jude,
containing the information that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had again consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin,
who took more and more warmly to the idea of tuition; and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had agreed to come. It did not occur for a moment to the
schoolmaster and recluse that Jude's ardour in promoting the
arrangement arose from any other feelings towards Sue than the
instinct of co-operation common among members of the same family.



<p/>V


<p/>The schoolmaster sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) homely dwelling attached to the school,
both being modern erections; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked across the way at the old
house in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) teacher Sue had a lodging. The arrangement had
been concluded very quickly. A pupil-teacher who was to have been
transferred to Mr. Phillotson's school had failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), and Sue had
been taken as stop-gap. All such provisional arrangements as these
could only last till the next annual visit of H.M. Inspector, whose
approval was necessary to make them permanent. Having taught for
some two years in London, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had abandoned that vocation of
late, Miss Bridehead was not exactly a novice, and Phillotson thought
there would be no difficulty in retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) services, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
already wished to do, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had only been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) three or four
weeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) quite as bright as Jude had described her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>);
and what master-tradesman does not wish to keep an apprentice who
saves him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) half his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) labour?

<p/>It was a little over half-past eight o'clock in the morning and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
was waiting to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cross the road to the school, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would
follow. At twenty minutes to nine she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did cross, a light hat tossed
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) as a curiosity. A new emanation,
which had nothing to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) skill as a teacher, seemed to
surround her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went to the school also, and Sue
remained governing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) class at the other end of the room, all day
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eye. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) certainly was an excellent teacher.

<p/>It was part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) duty to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) private lessons in the evening,
and some article in the Code made it necessary that a respectable,
elderly woman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and
the taught were of different sexes. Richard Phillotson thought of
the absurdity of the regulation in this case, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was old enough
to be the girl's father; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) faithfully acted up to it; and sat
down with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in a room where Mrs. Hawes, the widow at whose house
Sue lodged, occupied herself with sewing. The regulation was,
indeed, not easy to evade, for there was no other sitting-room in the
dwelling.

<p/>Sometimes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>) figured--it was arithmetic that they were working
at--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>) would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>) assumed that, being the master, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) must perceive
all that was passing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>) brain, as right or wrong. Phillotson was
not really thinking of the arithmetic at all, but of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>), in a novel
way which somehow seemed strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) as preceptor. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>)
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>) thus.

<p/>For a few weeks their work had gone on with a monotony which in
itself was a delight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). Then it happened that the children were
to be taken to Christminster to see an itinerant exhibition, in the
shape of a model of Jerusalem, to which schools were admitted at
a penny a head in the interests of education. They marched along
the road two and two, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>) beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>) class with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>) simple cotton
sunshade, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>) little thumb cocked up against its stem; and Phillotson
behind in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) long dangling coat, handling his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) walking-stick
genteelly, in the musing mood which had come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawes</b></font>)
arrival. The afternoon was one of sun and dust, and when they
entered the exhibition room few people were present but themselves.
The model of the ancient city stood in the middle of the apartment,
and the proprietor, with a fine religious philanthropy written on his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>)
features, walked round it with a pointer in his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) hand, showing the
young people the various quarters and places known to them by name
from reading their Bibles; Mount Moriah, the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
the City of Zion, the walls and the gates, outside one of which there
was a large mound like a tumulus, and on the mound a little white
cross. The spot, he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) said, was Calvary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue to the schoolmaster, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) stood with him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) a
little in the background, <div class="bookquote">``that this model, elaborate as it is, is a
very imaginary production. How does anybody know that Jerusalem was
like this in the time of Christ? I am sure this man doesn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is made after the best conjectural maps, based on actual visits
to the city as it now exists.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy we have had enough of Jerusalem,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``considering we
are not descended from the Jews. There was nothing first-rate about
the place, or people, after all--as there was about Athens, Rome,
Alexandria, and other old cities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my dear girl, consider what it is to us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was silent, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was easily repressed; and then perceived
behind the group of children clustered round the model a young man
in a white flannel jacket, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) form being bent so low in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intent
inspection of the Valley of Jehoshaphat that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was almost
hidden from view by the Mount of Olives. <div class="bookquote">``Look at your cousin Jude,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the schoolmaster</b></font>)</div>continued the schoolmaster. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) doesn't think we have had enough of
Jerusalem!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--I didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) quick, light voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Jude--how seriously you are going into it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude started up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reverie, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh--Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said,
with a glad flush of embarrassment. <div class="bookquote">``These are your school-children,
of course! I saw that schools were admitted in the afternoons, and
thought you might come; but I got so deeply interested that I didn't
remember where I was. How it carries one back, doesn't it! I could
examine it for hours, but I have only a few minutes, unfortunately;
for I am in the middle of a job out here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your cousin is so terribly clever that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) criticizes it
unmercifully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson, with good-humoured satire. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is
quite sceptical as to its correctness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Phillotson, I am not--altogether! I hate to be what is
called a clever girl--there are too many of that sort now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>answered
Sue sensitively. <div class="bookquote">``I only meant--I don't know what I meant--except
that it was what you don't understand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ know your meaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude ardently -LRB-although he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``And I think you are quite right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a good Jude--I know YOU believe in me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) impulsively
seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand, and leaving a reproachful look on the schoolmaster
turned away to Jude, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) voice revealing a tremor which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) herself
felt to be absurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had not
the least conception how the hearts of the twain went out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) at
this momentary revelation of feeling, and what a complication she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
building up thereby in the futures of both.

<p/>The model wore too much of an educational aspect for the children not
to tire of it soon, and a little later in the afternoon they were all
marched back to Lumsdon, Jude returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) watched the
juvenile flock in their clean frocks and pinafores, filing down the
street towards the country beside Phillotson and Sue, and a sad,
dissatisfied sense of being out of the scheme of the latters' lives
had possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). Phillotson had invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) to walk out
and see them on Friday evening, when there would be no lessons to
give to Sue, and Jude had eagerly promised to avail himself of the
opportunity.

<p/>Meanwhile the scholars and teachers moved homewards, and the next
day, on looking on the blackboard in Sue's class, Phillotson was
surprised to find upon it, skilfully drawn in chalk, a perspective
view of Jerusalem, with every building shown in its place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you took no interest in the model, and hardly looked at
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly did,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but I remembered that much of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is more than I had remembered myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) Majesty's school-inspector was at that time paying
<div class="bookquote">``surprise-visits''  (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div>in this neighbourhood to test the teaching
unawares; and two days later, in the middle of the morning lessons,
the latch of the door was softly lifted, and in walked my gentleman,
the king of terrors--to pupil-teachers.

<p/>To Mr. Phillotson the surprise was not great; like the lady in the
story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had been played that trick too many times to be unprepared.
But Sue's class was at the further end of the room, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) back was
towards the entrance; the inspector therefore came and stood behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) teaching some half-minute before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) became aware
of his (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) presence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) turned, and realized that an oft-dreaded moment
had come. The effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) timidity was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) uttered a
cry of fright. Phillotson, with a strange instinct of solicitude
quite beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) control, was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) side just in time to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
falling from faintness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) soon recovered herself, and laughed;
but when the inspector had gone there was a reaction, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
so white that Phillotson took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) room, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) some
brandy to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) gasped petulantly, <div class="bookquote">``that one of the
inspector's surprise-visits was imminent! Oh, what shall I do! Now
he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>)'ll write and tell the managers that I am no good, and I shall be
disgraced for ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) won't do that, my dear little girl. You are the best teacher
ever I had!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) looked so gently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was moved, and regretted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had upbraided him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was better she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went home.

<p/>Jude in the meantime had been waiting impatiently for Friday. On
both Wednesday and Thursday he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had been so much under the influence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) desire to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walked after dark some distance
along the road in the direction of the village, and, on returning to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) room to read, found himself quite unable to concentrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mind
on the page. On Friday, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had got himself up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
thought Sue would like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and made a hasty tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) set
out, notwithstanding that the evening was wet. The trees overhead
deepened the gloom of the hour, and they dripped sadly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
impressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with forebodings--illogical forebodings; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) also knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not be more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was.

<p/>On turning the corner and entering the village the first sight that
greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes was that of two figures under one umbrella coming
out of the vicarage gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was too far back for them to notice
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew in a moment that they were Sue and Phillotson. The
latter was holding the umbrella over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head, and they had evidently
been paying a visit to the vicar--probably on some business connected
with the school work. And as they walked along the wet and deserted
lane Jude saw Phillotson place his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) arm round the girl's waist;
whereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gently removed it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) replaced it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) let it
remain, looking quickly round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with an air of misgiving. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did
not look absolutely behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and therefore did not see Jude, who
sank into the hedge like one struck with a blight. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remained
hidden till they had reached Sue's cottage and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had passed in,
Phillotson going on to the school hard by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>)'s too old for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--too old!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>cried Jude in all the terrible
sickness of hopeless, handicapped love.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not interfere. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) not Arabella's? He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) was unable to
go on further, and retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) steps towards Christminster. Every
tread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) feet seemed to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) must on no account
stand in the schoolmaster's way with Sue. Phillotson was perhaps
twenty years her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) senior, but many a happy marriage had been made
in such conditions of age. The ironical clinch to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) sorrow was
given by the thought that the intimacy between his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) cousin and the
schoolmaster had been brought about entirely by himself.



<p/>VI


<p/>Jude's old and embittered aunt lay unwell at Marygreen, and on the
following Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)--a visit which was the result of
a victorious struggle against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) inclination to turn aside to the
village of Lumsdon and obtain a miserable interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin,
in which the word nearest his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heart could not be spoken, and the
sight which had tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not be revealed.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt was now unable to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) bed, and a great part of Jude's
short day was occupied in making arrangements for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) comfort. The
little bakery business had been sold to a neighbour, and with the
proceeds of this and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) savings she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was comfortably supplied with
necessaries and more, a widow of the same village living with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) and
ministering to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wants. It was not till the time had nearly come
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to leave that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) obtained a quiet talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
words tended insensibly towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Sue born here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was--in this room. They were living here at that time. What
made `ee ask that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I wanted to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you've been seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the harsh old woman. <div class="bookquote">``And what
did I tell `ee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--that I was not to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you gossiped with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then don't keep it up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was brought up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) father to hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
mother's family; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)'ll look with no favour upon a working chap
like you--a townish girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s become by now. I never cared much
about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). A pert little thing, that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was too often, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tight-strained nerves. Many's the time I've smacked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
impertinence. Why, one day when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was walking into the pond with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoes and stockings off, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) petticoats pulled above her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
knees, afore I could cry out for shame, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Move on, Aunty!
This is no sight for modest eyes!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a little child then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was twelve if a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--of course. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s older she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s of a thoughtful,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt, springing up in bed. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you be a fool
about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, of course not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your marrying that woman Arabella was about as bad a thing as a man
could possibly do for himself by trying hard. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s gone to
the other side of the world, and med never trouble you again. And
there'll be a worse thing if you, tied and bound as you be, should
have a fancy for Sue. If your cousin is civil to you, take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
civility for what it is worth. But anything more than a relation's
good wishes it is stark madness for `ee to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)'s
townish and wanton it med bring `ee to ruin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), Aunt! Don't, please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>A relief was afforded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) by the entry of the companion and nurse
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt, who must have been listening to the conversation, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) began a commentary on past years, introducing Sue Bridehead as
a character in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) recollections. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) described what an odd little
maid Sue had been when a pupil at the village school across the green
opposite, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) father went to London--how, when the vicar
arranged readings and recitations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) appeared on the platform, the
smallest of them all, <div class="bookquote">``in her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) little white frock, and shoes, and pink
sash'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) recited <div class="bookquote">``Excelsior,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There was a sound of revelry by
night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``The Raven'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; how during the delivery she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would knit her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
little brows and glare round tragically, and say to the empty air, as
if some real creature stood there--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven,
wandering from the Nightly shore,
Tell me what thy lordly name is
on the Night's Plutonian shore!''


 (<font color='red'><b>some creature</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)'d bring up the nasty carrion bird that clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>corroborated the
sick woman reluctantly, <div class="bookquote">``as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) stood there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) little sash and
things, that you could see un a`most before your very eyes. You too,
Jude, had the same trick as a child of seeming to see things in the
air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The neighbour told also of Sue's accomplishments in other kinds:

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was not exactly a tomboy, you know; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) could do things that
only boys do, as a rule. I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hit in and steer down the
long slide on yonder pond, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) little curls blowing, one of
a file of twenty moving along against the sky like shapes painted
on glass, and up the back slide without stopping. All boys except
herself; and then they'd cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)'d say, ``Don't be
saucy, boys,<div class="bookquote">'' and suddenly run indoors. They'd try to coax her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) out
again. But 'a wouldn't come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>These retrospective visions of Sue only made Jude the more miserable
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was unable to woo her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) left the cottage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt
that day with a heavy heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would fain have glanced into the
school to see the room in which Sue's little figure had so glorified
itself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) desire and went on.

<p/>It being Sunday evening some villagers who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
residence here were standing in a group in their best clothes. Jude
was startled by a salute from one of them:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye've got there right enough, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not understand.

<p/>``Why, to the seat of l'arning--the <div class="bookquote">``City of Light' you used to talk
to us about as a little boy! Is it all you expected of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; more!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>cried Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I was there once for an hour I didn't see much in it for my
part; auld crumbling buildings, half church, half almshouse, and not
much going on at that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are wrong, John; there is more going on than meets the eye of a
man walking through the streets. It is a unique centre of thought
and religion--the intellectual and spiritual granary of this country.
All that silence and absence of goings-on is the stillness of
infinite motion--the sleep of the spinning-top, to borrow the simile
of a well-known writer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, it med be all that, or it med not. As I say, I didn't see
nothing of it the hour or two I was there; so I went in and had a pot
o' beer, and a penny loaf, and a ha`porth o' cheese, and waited till
it was time to come along home. You've j'ined a college by this
time, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``I am almost as far off that as ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just what we thought! Such places be not for such as you--only for
them with plenty o' money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, with some bitterness. <div class="bookquote">``They are
for such ones!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Still, the remark was sufficient to withdraw Jude's attention from
the imaginative world he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had lately inhabited, in which an abstract
figure, more or less himself, was steeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mind in a sublimation
of the arts and sciences, and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) calling and election sure
to a seat in the paradise of the learned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was set regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
prospects in a cold northern light. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had lately felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
could not quite satisfy himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) Greek--in the Greek of
the dramatists particularly. So fatigued was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sometimes after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) day's work that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not maintain the critical attention
necessary for thorough application. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wanted a
coach--a friend at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) elbow to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in a moment what sometimes
would occupy him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) a weary month in extracting from unanticipative,
clumsy books.

<p/>It was decidedly necessary to consider facts a little more closely
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had done of late. What was the good, after all, of using
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) spare hours in a vague labour called <div class="bookquote">``private study''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>without
giving an outlook on practicabilities?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to have thought of this before,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) journeyed
back. <div class="bookquote">``It would have been better never to have embarked in the
scheme at all than to do it without seeing clearly where I am going,
or what I am aiming at... This hovering outside the walls of the
colleges, as if expecting some arm to be stretched out from them to
lift me inside, won't do! I must get special information.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The next week accordingly he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sought it. What at first seemed an
opportunity occurred one afternoon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw an elderly gentleman,
who had been pointed out as the head of a particular college, walking
in the public path of a parklike enclosure near the spot at which
Jude chanced to be sitting. The gentleman came nearer, and Jude
looked anxiously at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face. It seemed benign, considerate, yet
rather reserved. On second thoughts Jude felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not
go up and address him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was sufficiently influenced by the
incident to think what a wise thing it would be for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to state his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
difficulties by letter to some of the best and most judicious of
these old masters, and obtain their advice.

<p/>During the next week or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) accordingly placed himself in such
positions about the city as would afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) glimpses of several
of the most distinguished among the provosts, wardens, and other
heads of houses; and from those he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ultimately selected five whose
physiognomies seemed to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) that they were appreciative and
far-seeing men. To these five he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) addressed letters, briefly stating
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) difficulties, and asking their opinion on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stranded situation.

<p/>When the letters were posted Jude mentally began to criticize
them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wished they had not been sent. <div class="bookquote">``It is just one of those
intrusive, vulgar, pushing, applications which are so common in these
days,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Why couldn't I know better than address utter
strangers in such a way? I may be an impostor, an idle scamp, a man
with a bad character, for all that they know to the contrary...
Perhaps that's what I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found himself clinging to the hope of some reply
as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) one last chance of redemption. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) waited day after day,
saying that it was perfectly absurd to expect, yet expecting.
While he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) waited he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was suddenly stirred by news about Phillotson.
Phillotson was giving up the school near Christminster, for a larger
one further south, in Mid-Wessex. What this meant; how it would
affect his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) cousin; whether, as seemed possible, it was a practical
move of the schoolmaster's towards a larger income, in view of a
provision for two instead of one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) would not allow himself to say.
And the tender relations between Phillotson and the young girl of
whom Jude was passionately enamoured effectually made it repugnant to
Jude's tastes to apply to Phillotson for advice on his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) own scheme.

<p/>Meanwhile the academic dignitaries to whom Jude had written
vouchsafed no answer, and the young man was thus thrown back
entirely on himself, as formerly, with the added gloom of a weakened
hope. By indirect inquiries he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) soon perceived clearly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
long uneasily suspected, that to qualify himself for certain open
scholarships and exhibitions was the only brilliant course. But to
do this a good deal of coaching would be necessary, and much natural
ability. It was next to impossible that a man reading on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
system, however widely and thoroughly, even over the prolonged period
of ten years, should be able to compete with those who had passed
their lives under trained teachers and had worked to ordained lines.

<p/>The other course, that of buying himself in, so to speak, seemed the
only one really open to men like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the difficulty being simply of
a material kind. With the help of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) information he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to reckon
the extent of this material obstacle, and ascertained, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dismay,
that, at the rate at which, with the best of fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be
able to save money, fifteen years must elapse before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be in a
position to forward testimonials to the head of a college and advance
to a matriculation examination. The undertaking was hopeless.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw what a curious and cunning glamour the neighbourhood of the
place had exercised over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). To get there and live there, to move
among the churches and halls and become imbued with the _genius
loci_, had seemed to his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) dreaming youth, as the spot shaped its
charms to him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) from its halo on the horizon, the obvious and ideal
thing to do. <div class="bookquote">``Let me only get there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had said with the
fatuousness of Crusoe over his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) big boat, <div class="bookquote">``and the rest is but a
matter of time and energy.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It would have been far better for him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) in
every way if he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had never come within sight and sound of the delusive
precincts, had gone to some busy commercial town with the sole object
of making money by his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) wits, and thence surveyed his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) plan in true
perspective. Well, all that was clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) amounted to this, that
the whole scheme had burst up, like an iridescent soap-bubble, under
the touch of a reasoned inquiry. He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) looked back at himself along the
vista of his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) past years, and his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) thought was akin to Heine's:


<p/>Above the youth's inspired and flashing eyes
I see the motley mocking fool's-cap rise!


<p/>Fortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had not been allowed to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) disappointment into
his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) dear Sue's life by involving her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) in this collapse. And the
painful details of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) awakening to a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) limitations should
now be spared her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) as far as possible. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had only known
a little part of the miserable struggle in which he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had been engaged
thus unequipped, poor, and unforeseeing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) always remembered the appearance of the afternoon on which he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
awoke from his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) dream. Not quite knowing what to do with himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
went up to an octagonal chamber in the lantern of a singularly built
theatre that was set amidst this quaint and singular city. It had
windows all round, from which an outlook over the whole town and
its edifices could be gained. Jude's eyes swept all the views in
succession, meditatively, mournfully, yet sturdily. Those buildings
and their associations and privileges were not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). From the
looming roof of the great library, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hardly ever had time
to enter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) gaze travelled on to the varied spires, halls, gables,
streets, chapels, gardens, quadrangles, which composed the ensemble
of this unrivalled panorama. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) destiny lay not with
these, but among the manual toilers in the shabby purlieu which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
himself occupied, unrecognized as part of the city at all by its
visitors and panegyrists, yet without whose denizens the hard readers
could not read nor the high thinkers live.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked over the town into the country beyond, to the trees which
screened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) whose presence had at first been the support of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
heart, and whose loss was now a maddening torture. But for this blow
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might have borne with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fate. With Sue as companion he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could
have renounced his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ambitions with a smile. Without her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) it was
inevitable that the reaction from the long strain to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
subjected himself should affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) disastrously. Phillotson had
no doubt passed through a similar intellectual disappointment to
that which now enveloped him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). But the schoolmaster had been since
blest with the consolation of sweet Sue, while for him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) there was no
consoler.

<p/>Descending to the streets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) went listlessly along till he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) arrived
at an inn, and entered it. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) drank several glasses of beer in
rapid succession, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) came out it was night. By the light of
the flickering lamps he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) rambled home to supper, and had not long been
sitting at table when his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) landlady brought up a letter that had just
arrived for him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) laid it down as if impressed with a sense of
its possible importance, and on looking at it Jude perceived that it
bore the embossed stamp of one of the colleges whose heads he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
addressed. <div class="bookquote">``ONE--at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>cried Jude.

<p/>The communication was brief, and not exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had expected;
though it really was from the master in person. It ran thus:


<p/>BIBLIOLL COLLEGE.

<p/>SIR,--I have read your letter with interest; and, judging
from your description of yourself as a working-man, I
venture to think that you will have a much better chance
of success in life by remaining in your own sphere and
sticking to your trade than by adopting any other course.
That, therefore, is what I advise you to do. Yours
faithfully,

<p/>T. TETUPHENAY.

<p/>To Mr. J. FAWLEY, Stone-mason.


<p/>This terribly sensible advice exasperated Jude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had known all
that before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew it was true. Yet it seemed a hard slap after
ten years of labour, and its effect upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) just now was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
rise recklessly from the table, and, instead of reading as usual, to
go downstairs and into the street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stood at a bar and tossed off
two or three glasses, then unconsciously sauntered along till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
came to a spot called The Fourways in the middle of the city, gazing
abstractedly at the groups of people like one in a trance, till,
coming to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) began talking to the policeman fixed there.

<p/>That officer yawned, stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) elbows, elevated himself
an inch and a half on the balls of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) toes, smiled, and looking
humorously at Jude, said, <div class="bookquote">``You've had a wet, young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I've only begun,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) replied cynically.

<p/>Whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wetness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) brains were dry enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) only heard in
part the policeman's further remarks, having fallen into thought on
what struggling people like himself had stood at that crossway, whom
nobody ever thought of now. It had more history than the oldest
college in the city. It was literally teeming, stratified, with the
shades of human groups, who had met there for tragedy, comedy, farce;
real enactments of the intensest kind. At Fourways men had stood
and talked of Napoleon, the loss of America, the execution of King
Charles, the burning of the Martyrs, the Crusades, the Norman
Conquest, possibly of the arrival of Caesar. Here the two sexes had
met for loving, hating, coupling, parting; had waited, had suffered,
for each other; had triumphed over each other; cursed each other in
jealousy, blessed each other in forgiveness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely
more palpitating, varied, and compendious than the gown life.
These struggling men and women before him (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) were the reality of
Christminster, though they knew little of Christ or Minster.
That was one of the humours of things. The floating population
of students and teachers, who did know both in a way, were not
Christminster in a local sense at all.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) watch, and, in pursuit of this idea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) went on till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) came to a public hall, where a promenade concert was in progress.
Jude entered, and found the room full of shop youths and girls,
soldiers, apprentices, boys of eleven smoking cigarettes, and light
women of the more respectable and amateur class. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had tapped the
real Christminster life. A band was playing, and the crowd walked
about and jostled each other, and every now and then a man got upon
a platform and sang a comic song.

<p/>The spirit of Sue seemed to hover round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flirting
and drinking with the frolicsome girls who made advances--wistful
to gain a little joy. At ten o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came away, choosing a
circuitous route homeward to pass the gates of the college whose head
had just sent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the note.

<p/>The gates were shut, and, by an impulse, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket the
lump of chalk which as a workman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usually carried there, and wrote
along the wall:

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you:
yea, who knoweth not such things as these?_'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--Job xii. 3.



<p/>VII


<p/>The stroke of scorn relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, and the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) self-conceit. But the laugh was not a healthy one.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) re-read the letter from the master, and the wisdom in its lines,
which had at first exasperated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), chilled and depressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw himself as a fool indeed.

<p/>Deprived of the objects of both intellect and emotion, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not
proceed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt reconciled to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fate as a
student, there came to disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) calm his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hopeless relations with
Sue. That the one affined soul he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever met was lost to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage returned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with cruel persistency, till,
unable to bear it longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again rushed for distraction to the
real Christminster life. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now sought it out in an obscure and
low-ceiled tavern up a court which was well known to certain worthies
of the place, and in brighter times would have interested him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply
by its quaintness. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat more or less all the day, convinced
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at bottom a vicious character, of whom it was hopeless to
expect anything.

<p/>In the evening the frequenters of the house dropped in one by one,
Jude still retaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seat in the corner, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) money was all
spent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had not eaten anything the whole day except a biscuit.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) surveyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) gathering companions with all the equanimity
and philosophy of a man who has been drinking long and slowly,
and made friends with several: to wit, Tinker Taylor, a decayed
church-ironmonger who appeared to have been of a religious turn in
earlier years, but was somewhat blasphemous now; also a red-nosed
auctioneer; also two Gothic masons like himself, called Uncle Jim and
Uncle Joe. There were present, too, some clerks, and a gown- and
surplice-maker's assistant; two ladies who sported moral characters
of various depths of shade, according to their company, nicknamed
<div class="bookquote">``Bower o' Bliss''  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Freckles'' (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>; some horsey men <div class="bookquote">``in the know''
 (<font color='red'><b>some horsey men</b></font>)</div>of betting circles; a travelling actor from the theatre, and two
devil-may-care young men who proved to be gownless undergraduates;
they had slipped in by stealth to meet a man about bull-pups,
and stayed to drink and smoke short pipes with the racing gents
aforesaid, looking at their watches every now and then.

<p/>The conversation waxed general. Christminster society was
criticized, the dons, magistrates, and other people in authority
being sincerely pitied for their shortcomings, while opinions on how
they ought to conduct themselves and their affairs to be properly
respected, were exchanged in a large-minded and disinterested manner.

<p/>Jude Fawley, with the self-conceit, effrontery, and _aplomb_ of
a strong-brained fellow in liquor, threw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) remarks somewhat
peremptorily; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) aims having been what they were for so many
years, everything the others said turned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) tongue, by a sort
of mechanical craze, to the subject of scholarship and study, the
extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) own learning being dwelt upon with an insistence that
would have appeared pitiable to himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) sane hours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care a damn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) was saying, <div class="bookquote">``for any provost, warden,
principal, fellow, or cursed master of arts in the university! What
I know is that I'd lick 'em on their own ground if they'd give me a
chance, and show 'em a few things they are not up to yet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the undergraduates</b></font>)</div>said the undergraduates from the corner, where they
were talking privately about the pups.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You always was fond o' books, I've heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tinker Taylor/Taylor</b></font>)</div>said Tinker Taylor, <div class="bookquote">``and
I don't doubt what you state. Now with me 'twas different. I always
saw there was more to be learnt outside a book than in; and I took my
steps accordingly, or I shouldn't have been the man I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tinker Taylor/Taylor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You aim at the Church, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Joe. <div class="bookquote">``If you are such
a scholar as to pitch yer hopes so high as that, why not give us a
specimen of your scholarship? Canst say the Creed in Latin, man?
That was how they once put it to a chap down in my country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude haughtily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)! Like his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) conceit!''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>screamed one of the ladies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just you shut up, Bower o' Bliss!''  (<font color='red'><b>the undergraduates</b></font>)</div>said one of the undergraduates.
<div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) drank off the spirits in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) tumbler, rapped with it
on the counter, and announced, <div class="bookquote">``The gentleman in the corner is going
to rehearse the Articles of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Belief, in the Latin tongue, for the
edification of the company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spirits</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--have a try!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the surplice-maker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tinker Taylor/Taylor</b></font>)</div>said Tinker Taylor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll swear I can!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``Well, come now, stand me a small
Scotch cold, and I'll do it straight off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a fair offer,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the undergraduate, throwing down the
money for the whisky.

<p/>The barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person
compelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species, and the
glass was handed across to Jude, who, having drunk the contents,
stood up and began rhetorically, without hesitation:

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, Factorem coeli et terrae,
visibilium omnium et invisibilium._''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Excellent Latin!''  (<font color='red'><b>the undergraduates conception</b></font>)</div>cried one of the undergraduates, who,
however, had not the slightest conception of a single word.

<p/>A silence reigned among the rest in the bar, and the maid stood
still, Jude's voice echoing sonorously into the inner parlour, where
the landlord was dozing, and bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) out to see what was going
on. Jude had declaimed steadily ahead, and was continuing:

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Crucifixus etiam pro nobis: sub Pontio Pilato passus, et sepultus
est.. Et resurrexit tertia die, secundum Scripturas._''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the Nicene,''  (<font color='red'><b>the undergraduate</b></font>)</div>sneered the second undergraduate. <div class="bookquote">``And we
wanted the Apostles'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't say so! And every fool knows, except you, that the
Nicene is the most historic creed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let un go on, let un go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>said the auctioneer.

<p/>But Jude's mind seemed to grow confused soon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not get
on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face assumed an
expression of pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) another glass--then he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'ll fetch up and get through it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tinker Taylor/Taylor</b></font>)</div>said Tinker Taylor.

<p/>Somebody threw down threepence, the glass was handed, Jude stretched
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm for it without looking, and having swallowed the liquor,
went on in a moment in a revived voice, raising it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) neared the
end with the manner of a priest leading a congregation:

<p/>''_Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem, qui ex Patre
Filioque procedit. Qui cum Patre et Filio simul adoratur et
conglorificatur. Qui locutus est per prophetas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Et unam Catholicam et Apostolicam Ecclesiam. Confiteor unum
Baptisma in remissionem peccatorum. Et exspecto Resurrectionem
mortuorum. Et vitam venturi saeculi. Amen._''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said several, enjoying the last word, as being the first
and only one they had recognized.

<p/>Then Jude seemed to shake the fumes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) brain, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stared
round upon them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You pack of fools!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Which one of you knows whether I
have said it or no? It might have been the Ratcatcher's Daughter
in double Dutch for all that your besotted heads can tell! See what
I have brought myself to--the crew I have come among!''

 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord, who had already had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) license endorsed for harbouring
queer characters, feared a riot, and came outside the counter; but
Jude, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sudden flash of reason, had turned in disgust and left
the scene, the door slamming with a dull thud behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hastened down the lane and round into the straight broad street,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) followed till it merged in the highway, and all sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
late companions had been left behind. Onward he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) still went, under
the influence of a childlike yearning for the one being in the world
to whom it seemed possible to fly--an unreasoning desire, whose ill
judgement was not apparent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now. In the course of an hour,
when it was between ten and eleven o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) entered the village of
Lumsdon, and reaching the cottage, saw that a light was burning in
a downstairs room, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) assumed, rightly as it happened, to be
hers.

<p/>Jude stepped close to the wall, and tapped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) finger on the
pane, saying impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``Sue, Sue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must have recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) voice, for the light disappeared from
the apartment, and in a second or two the door was unlocked and
opened, and Sue appeared with a candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it Jude? Yes, it is! My dear, dear cousin, what's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am--I couldn't help coming, Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), sinking down upon
the doorstep. <div class="bookquote">``I am so wicked, Sue--my heart is nearly broken,
and I could not bear my life as it was! So I have been drinking,
and blaspheming, or next door to it, and saying holy things in
disreputable quarters--repeating in idle bravado words which ought
never to be uttered but reverently! Oh, do anything with me,
Sue--kill me--I don't care! Only don't hate me and despise me like
all the rest of the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are ill, poor dear! No, I won't despise you; of course I won't!
Come in and rest, and let me see what I can do for you. Now lean on
me, and don't mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>With one hand holding the candle and the other
supporting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) indoors, and placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in the only easy
chair the meagrely furnished house afforded, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) feet upon
another, and pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) boots. Jude, now getting towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
sober senses, could only say, <div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>in a voice broken by
grief and contrition.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wanted anything to eat, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head.
Then telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to go to sleep, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would come down early
in the morning and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) some breakfast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) good-night
and ascended the stairs.

<p/>Almost immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fell into a heavy slumber, and did not wake
till dawn. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was, but by degrees his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
situation cleared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) beheld it in all the ghastliness
of a right mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knew the worst of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)--the very worst. How
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) now? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would soon be coming down to see about
breakfast, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had said, and there would he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) be in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) shame
confronting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not bear the thought, and softly drawing
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) boots, and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hat from the nail on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had hung
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) slipped noiselessly out of the house.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fixed idea was to get away to some obscure spot and hide, and
perhaps pray; and the only spot which occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was Marygreen.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) called at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lodging in Christminster, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found awaiting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) a note of dismissal from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) employer; and having packed up he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) back upon the city that had been such a thorn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
side, and struck southward into Wessex. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had no money left in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pocket, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) small savings, deposited at one of the banks in
Christminster, having fortunately been left untouched. To get to
Marygreen, therefore, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) only course was walking; and the distance
being nearly twenty miles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had ample time to complete on the way
the sobering process begun in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>At some hour of the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reached Alfredston. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pawned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) waistcoat, and having gone out of the town a mile or two, slept
under a rick that night. At dawn he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) rose, shook off the hayseeds and
stems from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) clothes, and started again, breasting the long white
road up the hill to the downs, which had been visible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) a long
way off, and passing the milestone at the top, whereon he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had carved
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hopes years ago.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reached the ancient hamlet while the people were at breakfast.
Weary and mud-bespattered, but quite possessed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ordinary
clearness of brain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sat down by the well, thinking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did so
what a poor Christ he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) made. Seeing a trough of water near he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) bathed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) face, and went on to the cottage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) great-aunt, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) found
breakfasting in bed, attended by the woman who lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--out o' work?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) relative, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) through eyes
sunken deep, under lids heavy as pot-covers, no other cause for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)
tumbled appearance suggesting itself to one whose whole life had been
a struggle with material things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude heavily. <div class="bookquote">``I think I must have a little rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Refreshed by some breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old room and lay down
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) shirt-sleeves, after the manner of the artizan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fell
asleep for a short while, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) awoke it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
awakened in hell. It WAS hell--<div class="bookquote">``the hell of conscious failure,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>both
in ambition and in love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought of that previous abyss into
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had fallen before leaving this part of the country; the
deepest deep he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had supposed it then; but it was not so deep as this.
That had been the breaking in of the outer bulwarks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hope:
this was of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) second line.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had been a woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) must have screamed under the nervous
tension which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was now undergoing. But that relief being denied to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) virility, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) teeth in misery, bringing lines about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mouth like those in the Laocoön, and corrugations between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
brows.

<p/>A mournful wind blew through the trees, and sounded in the chimney
like the pedal notes of an organ. Each ivy leaf overgrowing the wall
of the churchless church-yard hard by, now abandoned, pecked its
neighbour smartly, and the vane on the new Victorian-Gothic church in
the new spot had already begun to creak. Yet apparently it was not
always the outdoor wind that made the deep murmurs; it was a voice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) guessed its origin in a moment or two; the curate was praying with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt in the adjoining room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).
Presently the sounds ceased, and a step seemed to cross the landing.
Jude sat up, and shouted <div class="bookquote">``Hoi!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>The step made for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) door, which was open, and a man looked in.
It was a young clergyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are Mr. Highridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``My aunt has mentioned
you more than once. Well, here I am, just come home; a fellow gone
to the bad; though I had the best intentions in the world at one
time. Now I am melancholy mad, what with drinking and one thing and
another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Slowly Jude unfolded to the curate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) late plans and movements, by
an unconscious bias dwelling less upon the intellectual and ambitious
side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dream, and more upon the theological, though this had, up
till now, been merely a portion of the general plan of advancement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I know I have been a fool, and that folly is with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>added
Jude in conclusion. <div class="bookquote">``And I don't regret the collapse of my
university hopes one jot. I wouldn't begin again if I were sure to
succeed. I don't care for social success any more at all. But I do
feel I should like to do some good thing; and I bitterly regret the
Church, and the loss of my chance of being her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) ordained minister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The curate man</b></font>)</div><p/>The curate, who was a new man to this neighbourhood, had grown deeply
interested, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``If you feel a real call to the
ministry, and I won't say from your conversation that you do not,
for it is that of a thoughtful and educated man, you might enter the
Church as a licentiate. Only you must make up your mind to avoid
strong drink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could avoid that easily enough, if I had any kind of hope to
support me!''

<p/>AT MELCHESTER



<p/><div class="bookquote">``For there was no other girl, O bridegroom,

<p/>I


<p/>It was a new idea--the ecclesiastical and altruistic life as distinct
from the intellectual and emulative life. A man could preach and
do good to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow-creatures without taking double-firsts in the
schools of Christminster, or having anything but ordinary knowledge.
The old fancy which had led on to the culminating vision of the
bishopric had not been an ethical or theological enthusiasm at all,
but a mundane ambition masquerading in a surplice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feared that
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole scheme had degenerated to, even though it might not have
originated in, a social unrest which had no foundation in the nobler
instincts; which was purely an artificial product of civilization.
There were thousands of young men on the same self-seeking track
at the present moment. The sensual hind who ate, drank, and lived
carelessly with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife through the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vanity was a more
likable being than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>But to enter the Church in such an unscholarly way that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not
in any probability rise to a higher grade through all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) career than
that of the humble curate wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life out in an obscure village
or city slum--that might have a touch of goodness and greatness in
it; that might be true religion, and a purgatorial course worthy of
being followed by a remorseful man.

<p/>The favourable light in which this new thought showed itself by
contrast with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foregone intentions cheered Jude, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sat there,
shabby and lonely; and it may be said to have given, during the next
few days, the _coup de grâce_ to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) intellectual career--a career
which had extended over the greater part of a dozen years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did
nothing, however, for some long stagnant time to advance his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) new
desire, occupying himself with little local jobs in putting up and
lettering headstones about the neighbouring villages, and submitting
to be regarded as a social failure, a returned purchase, by the
half-dozen or so of farmers and other country-people who condescended
to nod to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>The human interest of the new intention--and a human interest is
indispensable to the most spiritual and self-sacrificing--was created
by a letter from Sue, bearing a fresh postmark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) evidently
wrote with anxiety, and told very little about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own doings, more
than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had passed some sort of examination for a Queen's
Scholarship, and was going to enter a training college at Melchester
to complete herself for the vocation she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) had chosen, partly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
influence. There was a theological college at Melchester; Melchester
was a quiet and soothing place, almost entirely ecclesiastical in its
tone; a spot where worldly learning and intellectual smartness had no
establishment; where the altruistic feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did possess would
perhaps be more highly estimated than a brilliancy which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not.

<p/>As it would be necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) should continue for a time to work
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) trade while reading up Divinity, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had neglected at
Christminster for the ordinary classical grind, what better course
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) than to get employment at the further city, and pursue this
plan of reading? That his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) excessive human interest in the new place
was entirely of Sue's making, while at the same time Sue was to be
regarded even less than formerly as proper to create it, had an
ethical contradictoriness to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was not blind. But that much
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) conceded to human frailty, and hoped to learn to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) only as
a friend and kinswoman.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might so mark out his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) coming years as to begin
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ministry at the age of thirty--an age which much attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as
being that of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) exemplar when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) first began to teach in Galilee.
This would allow him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) plenty of time for deliberate study, and for
acquiring capital by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) trade to help his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) aftercourse of keeping the
necessary terms at a theological college.



<p/>Christmas had come and passed, and Sue had gone to the Melchester
Normal School. The time was just the worst in the year for Jude to
get into new employment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had written suggesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) should postpone his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arrival for a month or so, till the days had
lengthened. She (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had acquiesced so readily that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had not
proposed it--she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) evidently did not much care about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had never once reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) strange conduct in coming to
her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that night, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) silent disappearance. Neither had she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ever
said a word about her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) relations with Mr. Phillotson.

<p/>Suddenly, however, quite a passionate letter arrived from Sue.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was quite lonely and miserable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hated the
place she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was in; it was worse than the ecclesiastical designer's;
worse than anywhere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) felt utterly friendless; could he (<font color='blue'><b>designer</b></font>) come
immediately?--though when he (<font color='blue'><b>designer</b></font>) did come she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would only be able to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>designer</b></font>) at limited times, the rules of the establishment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) found
herself in being strict to a degree. It was Mr. Phillotson who had
advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to come there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had never listened to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>).

<p/>Phillotson's suit was not exactly prospering, evidently; and Jude
felt unreasonably glad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) packed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) things and went to
Melchester with a lighter heart than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had known for months.

<p/>This being the turning over a new leaf he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) duly looked about for
a temperance hotel, and found a little establishment of that
description in the street leading from the station. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
had something to eat he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walked out into the dull winter light over
the town bridge, and turned the corner towards the Close. The
day was foggy, and standing under the walls of the most graceful
architectural pile in England he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) paused and looked up. The lofty
building was visible as far as the roofridge; above, the dwindling
spire rose more and more remotely, till its apex was quite lost in
the mist drifting across it.

<p/>The lamps now began to be lighted, and turning to the west front
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walked round. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took it as a good omen that numerous blocks
of stone were lying about, which signified that the cathedral was
undergoing restoration or repair to a considerable extent. It seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), full of the superstitions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) beliefs, that this was an
exercise of forethought on the part of a ruling Power, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might
find plenty to do in the art he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) practised while waiting for a call to
higher labours.

<p/>Then a wave of warmth came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought how near he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now
stood to the bright-eyed vivacious girl with the broad forehead
and pile of dark hair above it; the girl with the kindling glance,
daringly soft at times--something like that of the girls he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
seen in engravings from paintings of the Spanish school. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
here--actually in this Close--in one of the houses confronting this
very west façade.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went down the broad gravel path towards the building. It was
an ancient edifice of the fifteenth century, once a palace, now
a training-school, with mullioned and transomed windows, and a
courtyard in front shut in from the road by a wall. Jude opened the
gate and went up to the door through which, on inquiring for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
cousin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was gingerly admitted to a waiting-room, and in a few
minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came.

<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been here such a short while, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) last. All her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bounding manner was gone; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) curves of
motion had become subdued lines. The screens and subtleties of
convention had likewise disappeared. Yet neither was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quite the
woman who had written the letter that summoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). That had plainly
been dashed off in an impulse which second thoughts had somewhat
regretted; thoughts that were possibly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) recent self-disgrace.
Jude was quite overcome with emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't--think me a demoralized wretch--for coming to you as I
was--and going so shamefully, Sue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have tried not to! You said enough to let me know what had
caused it. I hope I shall never have any doubt of your worthiness,
my poor Jude! And I am glad you have come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore a murrey-coloured gown with a little lace collar. It was
made quite plain, and hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slight figure with clinging
gracefulness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair, which formerly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had worn according to the
custom of the day was now twisted up tightly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had altogether
the air of a woman clipped and pruned by severe discipline,
an under-brightness shining through from the depths which that
discipline had not yet been able to reach.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had come forward prettily, but Jude felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had hardly
expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was burning to do, under other
colours than those of cousinship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not perceive the least
sign that Sue regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as a lover, or ever would do so, now that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knew the worst of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had the right to behave as one;
and this helped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) growing resolve to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) matrimonial
entanglement, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had put off doing from time to time in sheer
dread of losing the bliss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) company.

<p/>Sue came out into the town with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and they walked and talked with
tongues centred only on the passing moments. Jude said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would like
to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) a little present of some sort, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) confessed,
with something of shame, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was dreadfully hungry. They were
kept on very short allowances in the college, and a dinner, tea, and
supper all in one was the present she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) most desired in the world.
Jude thereupon took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to an inn and ordered whatever the house
afforded, which was not much. The place, however, gave them a
delightful opportunity for a _tête-à-tête_, nobody else being in the
room, and they talked freely.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) about the school as it was at that date, and the rough
living, and the mixed character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) fellow-students, gathered
together from all parts of the diocese, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had to get up and
work by gas-light in the early morning, with all the bitterness of
a young person to whom restraint was new. To all this he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) listened;
but it was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wanted especially to know--her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) relations with
Phillotson. That was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not tell. When they had sat and
eaten, Jude impulsively placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand upon hers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked up
and smiled, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) quite freely into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own little soft one,
dividing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fingers and coolly examining them, as if they were the
fingers of a glove she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was purchasing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hands are rather rough, Jude, aren't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. So would yours be if they held a mallet and chisel all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't dislike it, you know. I think it is noble to see a man's
hands subdued to what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) works in... Well, I'm rather glad I came
to this training-school, after all. See how independent I shall be
after the two years' training! I shall pass pretty high, I expect,
and Mr. Phillotson will use his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) influence to get me a big school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had touched the subject at last. <div class="bookquote">``I had a suspicion, a fear,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)--cared about you rather warmly, and perhaps
wanted to marry you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't be such a silly boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has said something about it, I expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had, what would it matter? An old man like him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come, Sue; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s not so very old. And I know what I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
doing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not kissing me--that I'm certain!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But putting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm round your waist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--I remember. But I didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are wriggling out if it, Sue, and it isn't quite kind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) ever-sensitive lip began to quiver, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eye to blink, at
something this reproof was deciding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you'll be angry if I tell you everything, and that's why I
don't want to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``I have no real right
to ask you, and I don't wish to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall tell you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), with the perverseness that was
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This is what I have done: I have promised--I
have promised--that I will marry him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) when I come out of the
training-school two years hence, and have got my certificate; his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
plan being that we shall then take a large double school in a great
town--he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) the boys' and I the girls'--as married school-teachers often
do, and make a good income between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sue! ... But of course it is right--you couldn't have done
better!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) and their eyes met, the reproach in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own belying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) words. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand quite away from hers, and turned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face in estrangement from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to the window. Sue regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
passively without moving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you would be angry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said with an air of no emotion
whatever. <div class="bookquote">``Very well--I am wrong, I suppose! I ought not to have
let you come to see me! We had better not meet again; and we'll only
correspond at long intervals, on purely business matters!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This was just the one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would not be able to bear, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
probably knew, and it brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) round at once. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, we will,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Your being engaged can make no difference to me
whatever. I have a perfect right to see you when I want to; and I
shall!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't let us talk of it any more. It is quite spoiling our
evening together. What does it matter about what one is going to do
two years hence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was something of a riddle to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) let the subject drift
away. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we go and sit in the cathedral?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) asked, when their
meal was finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cathedral? Yes. Though I think I'd rather sit in the railway
station,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) answered, a remnant of vexation still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``That's the centre of the town life now. The cathedral has had its
day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How modern you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So would you be if you had lived so much in the Middle Ages as I
have done these last few years! The cathedral was a very good place
four or five centuries ago; but it is played out now... I am not
modern, either. I am more ancient than mediævalism, if you only
knew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude looked distressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There--I won't say any more of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Only you don't
know how bad I am, from your point of view, or you wouldn't think so
much of me, or care whether I was engaged or not. Now there's just
time for us to walk round the Close, then I must go in, or I shall be
locked out for the night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to the gate and they parted. Jude had a conviction that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) unhappy visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) on that sad night had precipitated this
marriage engagement, and it did anything but add to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) happiness.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) reproach had taken that shape, then, and not the shape of words.
However, next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) set about seeking employment, which it was not
so easy to get as at Christminster, there being, as a rule, less
stone-cutting in progress in this quiet city, and hands being mostly
permanent. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) edged himself in by degrees. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) first work was
some carving at the cemetery on the hill; and ultimately he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) became
engaged on the labour he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) most desired--the cathedral repairs, which
were very extensive, the whole interior stonework having been
overhauled, to be largely replaced by new. It might be a labour of
years to get it all done, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had confidence enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own
skill with the mallet and chisel to feel that it would be a matter of
choice with himself how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would stay.

<p/>The lodgings he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took near the Close Gate would not have disgraced a
curate, the rent representing a higher percentage on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wages than
mechanics of any sort usually care to pay. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) combined bed and
sitting-room was furnished with framed photographs of the rectories
and deaneries at which his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) landlady had lived as trusted servant in
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) time, and the parlour downstairs bore a clock on the mantelpiece
inscribed to the effect that it was presented to the same
serious-minded woman by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fellow-servants on the occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
marriage. Jude added to the furniture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) room by unpacking
photographs of the ecclesiastical carvings and monuments that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had executed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own hands; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was deemed a satisfactory
acquisition as tenant of the vacant apartment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found an ample supply of theological books in the city book-shops,
and with these his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) studies were recommenced in a different spirit and
direction from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) former course. As a relaxation from the Fathers,
and such stock works as Paley and Butler, he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) read Newman, Pusey, and
many other modern lights. He (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) hired a harmonium, set it up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>)
lodging, and practised chants thereon, single and double.



<p/>II


<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow is our grand day, you know. Where shall we go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have leave from three till nine. Wherever we can get to and come
back from in that time. Not ruins, Jude--I don't care for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--Wardour Castle. And then we can do Fonthill if we like--all
in the same afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wardour is Gothic ruins--and I hate Gothic!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Quite otherwise. It is a classic building--Corinthian, I
think; with a lot of pictures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--that will do. I like the sound of Corinthian. We'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their conversation had run thus some few weeks later, and next
morning they prepared to start. Every detail of the outing was
a facet reflecting a sparkle to Jude, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not venture to
meditate on the life of inconsistency he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was leading. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) Sue's
conduct was one lovely conundrum to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could say no more.

<p/>There duly came the charm of calling at the college door for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
emergence in a nunlike simplicity of costume that was rather enforced
than desired; the traipsing along to the station, the porters'
<div class="bookquote">``B'your leave!,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porters</b></font>)</div>the screaming of the trains--everything formed the
basis of a beautiful crystallization. Nobody stared at Sue, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was so plainly dressed, which comforted Jude in the thought that
only himself knew the charms those habiliments subdued. A matter
of ten pounds spent in a drapery-shop, which had no connection
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) real life or her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) real self, would have set all Melchester
staring. The guard of the train thought they were lovers, and put
them into a compartment all by themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a good intention wasted!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>Jude did not respond. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought the remark unnecessarily cruel,
and partly untrue.

<p/>They reached the park and castle and wandered through the
picture-galleries, Jude stopping by preference in front of the
devotional pictures by Del Sarto, Guido Reni, Spagnoletto,
Sassoferrato, Carlo Dolci, and others. Sue paused patiently beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>), and stole critical looks into his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) face as, regarding the
Virgins, Holy Families, and Saints, it grew reverent and abstracted.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had thoroughly estimated him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) at this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would move on and
wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) before a Lely or Reynolds. It was evident that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
cousin deeply interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), as one might be interested in a man
puzzling out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way along a labyrinth from which one had one's self
escaped.

<p/>When they came out a long time still remained to them and Jude
proposed that as soon as they had had something to eat they should
walk across the high country to the north of their present position,
and intercept the train of another railway leading back to
Melchester, at a station about seven miles off. Sue, who was
inclined for any adventure that would intensify the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
day's freedom, readily agreed; and away they went, leaving the
adjoining station behind them.

<p/>It was indeed open country, wide and high. They talked and bounded
on, Jude cutting from a little covert a long walking-stick for Sue
as tall as herself, with a great crook, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) look like a
shepherdess. About half-way on their journey they crossed a main
road running due east and west--the old road from London to Land's
End. They paused, and looked up and down it for a moment, and
remarked upon the desolation which had come over this once lively
thoroughfare, while the wind dipped to earth and scooped straws and
hay-stems from the ground.

<p/>They crossed the road and passed on, but during the next half-mile
Sue seemed to grow tired, and Jude began to be distressed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).
They had walked a good distance altogether, and if they could not
reach the other station it would be rather awkward. For a long
time there was no cottage visible on the wide expanse of down and
turnip-land; but presently they came to a sheepfold, and next to the
shepherd, pitching hurdles. He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) told them that the only house near
was his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) mother's and his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), pointing to a little dip ahead from which a
faint blue smoke arose, and recommended them to go on and rest there.

<p/>This they did, and entered the house, admitted by an old woman
without a single tooth, to whom they were as civil as strangers can
be when their only chance of rest and shelter lies in the favour of
the householder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice little cottage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know about the niceness. I shall have to thatch it
soon, and where the thatch is to come from I can't tell, for straw do
get that dear, that `twill soon be cheaper to cover your house wi'
chainey plates than thatch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shepherd</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat resting, and the shepherd came in. <div class="bookquote">``Don't `ee mind I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
said with a deprecating wave of the hand; <div class="bookquote">``bide here as long as ye
will. But mid you be thinking o' getting back to Melchester to-night
by train? Because you'll never do it in this world, since you don't
know the lie of the country. I don't mind going with ye some o' the
ways, but even then the train mid be gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They started up.

<p/>``You can bide here, you know, over the night--can't 'em, Mother?
The place is welcome to ye. ``Tis hard lying, rather, but volk may do
worse.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned to Jude and asked privately: <div class="bookquote">``Be you a married
couple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hsh--no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I meant nothing ba`dy--not I! Well then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) can go into
Mother's room, and you and I can lie in the outer chimmer after
they've gone through. I can call ye soon enough to catch the first
train back. You've lost this one now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shepherd bacon greens</b></font>)</div><p/>On consideration they decided to close with this offer, and drew up
and shared with the shepherd and his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) mother the boiled bacon and
greens for supper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue, while their entertainers were
clearing away the dishes. <div class="bookquote">``Outside all laws except gravitation and
germination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You only think you like it; you don't: you are quite a product of
civilization,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, a recollection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) engagement reviving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) soreness a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am not, Jude. I like reading and all that, but I crave to
get back to the life of my infancy and its freedom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember it so well? You seem to me to have nothing
unconventional at all about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, haven't I! You don't know what's inside me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Ishmaelite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An urban miss is what you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked severe disagreement, and turned away.

<p/>The shepherd aroused them the next morning, as he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) had said. It was
bright and clear, and the four miles to the train were accomplished
pleasantly. When they had reached Melchester, and walked to the
Close, and the gables of the old building in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was again to
be immured rose before Sue's eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked a little scared. <div class="bookquote">``I
expect I shall catch it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>They rang the great bell and waited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I bought something for you, which I had nearly forgotten,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
said quickly, searching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``It is a new little photograph
of me. Would you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``WOULD I!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) took it gladly, and the porter came. There seemed to
be an ominous glance on his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) face when he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) opened the gate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) passed
in, looking back at Jude, and waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand.



<p/>III


<p/>The seventy young women, of ages varying in the main from nineteen to
one-and-twenty, though several were older, who at this date filled
the species of nunnery known as the Training-School at Melchester,
formed a very mixed community, which included the daughters of
mechanics, curates, surgeons, shopkeepers, farmers, dairy-men,
soldiers, sailors, and villagers. They sat in the large school-room
of the establishment on the evening previously described, and word
was passed round that Sue Bridehead had not come in at closing-time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went out with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>student</b></font>)</div>said a second-year's student, who
knew about young men. <div class="bookquote">``And Miss Traceley saw her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) at the station with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll have it hot when she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) does come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>observed a youthful new girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That excuse has been made a little too often in this school to be
effectual in saving our souls,''  (<font color='red'><b>the head girl</b></font>)</div>said the head girl of the year,
drily.

<p/>The fact was that, only twelve months before, there had occurred
a lamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same
statement in order to gain meetings with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover. The affair had
created a scandal, and the management had consequently been rough on
cousins ever since.

<p/>At nine o'clock the names were called, Sue's being pronounced three
times sonorously by Miss Traceley without eliciting an answer.

<p/>At a quarter past nine the seventy stood up to sing the <div class="bookquote">``Evening
Hymn,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and then knelt down to prayers. After prayers they went in to
supper, and every girl's thought was, Where is Sue Bridehead? Some
of the students, who had seen Jude from the window, felt that they
would not mind risking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) punishment for the pleasure of being
kissed by such a kindly-faced young man. Hardly one among them
believed in the cousinship.

<p/>Half an hour later they all lay in their cubicles, their tender
feminine faces upturned to the flaring gas-jets which at intervals
stretched down the long dormitories, every face bearing the legend
<div class="bookquote">``The Weaker''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>upon it, as the penalty of the sex wherein they were
moulded, which by no possible exertion of their willing hearts and
abilities could be made strong while the inexorable laws of nature
remain what they are. They formed a pretty, suggestive, pathetic
sight, of whose pathos and beauty they were themselves unconscious,
and would not discover till, amid the storms and strains of
after-years, with their injustice, loneliness, child-bearing, and
bereavement, their minds would revert to this experience as to
something which had been allowed to slip past them insufficiently
regarded.

<p/>One of the mistresses came in to turn out the lights, and before
doing so gave a final glance at Sue's cot, which remained empty, and
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) little dressing-table at the foot, which, like all the rest,
was ornamented with various girlish trifles, framed photographs being
not the least conspicuous among them. Sue's table had a moderate
show, two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looking-glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are these men--did she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) ever say?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>asked the mistress. <div class="bookquote">``Strictly
speaking, relations' portraits only are allowed on these tables, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One--the middle-aged man,''  (<font color='red'><b>a student</b></font>)</div>said a student in the next bed--<div class="bookquote">``is the
schoolmaster she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) served under--Mr. Phillotson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a student</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the other--this undergraduate in cap and gown--who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) is a friend, or was. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has never told his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it either of these two who came for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure 'twas not the undergraduate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was a young man with a black beard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>The lights were promptly extinguished, and till they fell asleep the
girls indulged in conjectures about Sue, and wondered what games
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had carried on in London and at Christminster before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) came
here, some of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking
from the mullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral
opposite, and the spire rising behind it.

<p/>When they awoke the next morning they glanced into Sue's nook,
to find it still without a tenant. After the early lessons by
gas-light, in half-toilet, and when they had come up to dress for
breakfast, the bell of the entrance gate was heard to ring loudly.
The mistress of the dormitory went away, and presently came back to
say that the principal's orders were that nobody was to speak to
Bridehead without permission.

<p/>When, accordingly, Sue came into the dormitory to hastily tidy
herself, looking flushed and tired, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cubicle in
silence, none of them coming out to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) or to make inquiry.
When they had gone downstairs they found that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did not follow them
into the dining-hall to breakfast, and they then learnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had
been severely reprimanded, and ordered to a solitary room for a week,
there to be confined, and take her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) meals, and do all her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) reading.

<p/>At this the seventy murmured, the sentence being, they thought, too
severe. A round robin was prepared and sent in to the principal,
asking for a remission of Sue's punishment. No notice was taken.
Towards evening, when the geography mistress began dictating her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
subject, the girls in the class sat with folded arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that you are not going to work?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>said the mistress at last.
<div class="bookquote">``I may as well tell you that it has been ascertained that the young
man Bridehead stayed out with was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) cousin, for the very
good reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) has no such relative. We have written to
Christminster to ascertain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are willing to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) word,''  (<font color='red'><b>the head girl</b></font>)</div>said the head girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This young man was discharged from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work at Christminster for
drunkenness and blasphemy in public-houses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has come here to
live, entirely to be near her (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>However, they remained stolid and motionless, and the mistress left
the room to inquire from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) superiors what was to be done.

<p/>Presently, towards dusk, the pupils, as they sat, heard exclamations
from the first-year's girls in an adjoining classroom, and one rushed
in to say that Sue Bridehead had got out of the back window of the
room in which she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had been confined, escaped in the dark across the
lawn, and disappeared. How she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had managed to get out of the garden
nobody could tell, as it was bounded by the river at the bottom, and
the side door was locked.

<p/>They went and looked at the empty room, the casement between the
middle mullions of which stood open. The lawn was again searched
with a lantern, every bush and shrub being examined, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was
nowhere hidden. Then the porter of the front gate was interrogated,
and on reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) remembered hearing a sort of
splashing in the stream at the back, but he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had taken no notice,
thinking some ducks had come down the river from above.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bridehead</b></font>) must have walked through the river!''  (<font color='red'><b>a mistress</b></font>)</div>said a mistress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or drownded herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>said the porter.

<p/>The mind of the matron was horrified--not so much at the possible
death of Sue as at the possible half-column detailing that event in
all the newspapers, which, added to the scandal of the year before,
would give the college an unenviable notoriety for many months to
come.

<p/>More lanterns were procured, and the river examined; and then, at
last, on the opposite shore, which was open to the fields, some
little boot-tracks were discerned in the mud, which left no doubt
that the too excitable girl had waded through a depth of water
reaching nearly to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders--for this was the chief river of the
county, and was mentioned in all the geography books with respect.
As Sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself,
the matron began to speak superciliously of her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), and to express
gladness that she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>On the self-same evening Jude sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lodgings by the Close Gate.
Often at this hour after dusk he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would enter the silent Close, and
stand opposite the house that contained Sue, and watch the shadows of
the girls' heads passing to and fro upon the blinds, and wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
nothing else to do but to sit reading and learning all day what many
of the thoughtless inmates despised. But to-night, having finished
tea and brushed himself up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was deep in the perusal of the
Twenty-ninth Volume of Pusey's Library of the Fathers, a set of books
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pusey</b></font>) had purchased of a second-hand dealer at a price that seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pusey</b></font>) to be one of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pusey</b></font>)
fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Pusey</b></font>) heard something rattle lightly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Pusey</b></font>) window; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pusey</b></font>)
heard it again. Certainly somebody had thrown gravel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pusey</b></font>) rose and
gently lifted the sash.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-from below-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--it is! Can I come up without being seen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't come down. Shut the window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude waited, knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could enter easily enough, the front
door being opened merely by a knob which anybody could turn, as
in most old country towns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) palpitated at the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had fled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) trouble as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had fled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). What
counterparts they were! He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) unlatched the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) room, heard a
stealthy rustle on the dark stairs, and in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) appeared in
the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lamp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went up to seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand, and found she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
was clammy as a marine deity, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) clothes clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) like
the robes upon the figures in the Parthenon frieze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so cold!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said through her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) chattering teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Can I come by
your fire, Jude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) crossed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) little grate and very little fire, but as the
water dripped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) moved, the idea of drying herself was
absurd. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever have you done, darling?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) asked, with alarm, the
tender epithet slipping out unawares.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walked through the largest river in the county--that's what I've
done! They locked me up for being out with you; and it seemed so
unjust that I couldn't bear it, so I got out of the window and
escaped across the stream!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had begun the explanation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
usual slightly independent tones, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had finished the
thin pink lips trembled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could hardly refrain from crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You must take off all your things! And let me
see--you must borrow some from the landlady. I'll ask her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) know, for God's sake! We are so near the
school that they'll come after me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must put on mine. You don't mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Sunday suit, you know. It is close here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>In fact, everything
was close and handy in Jude's single chamber, because there was not
room for it to be otherwise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) opened a drawer, took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) best
dark suit, and giving the garments a shake, said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, how long
shall I give you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude left the room and went into the street, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walked up and
down. A clock struck half-past seven, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) returned. Sitting in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) only arm-chair he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw a slim and fragile being masquerading as
himself on a Sunday, so pathetic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) defencelessness that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
heart felt big with the sense of it. On two other chairs before the
fire were her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wet garments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) blushed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
but only for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose, Jude, it is odd that you should see me like this and all
my things hanging there? Yet what nonsense! They are only a woman's
clothes--sexless cloth and linen... I wish I didn't feel so ill and
sick! Will you dry my clothes now? Please do, Jude, and I'll get a
lodging by and by. It is not late yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you shan't, if you are ill. You must stay here. Dear, dear
Sue, what can I get for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know! I can't help shivering. I wish I could get warm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) great-coat in addition, and then ran out to the
nearest public-house, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) returned with a little bottle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
hand. <div class="bookquote">``Here's six of best brandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Now you drink it,
dear; all of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't out of the bottle, can I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude fetched the glass from the
dressing-table, and administered the spirit in some water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
gasped a little, but gulped it down, and lay back in the armchair.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) then began to relate circumstantially her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) experiences since
they had parted; but in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) story her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) voice faltered,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head nodded, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ceased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was in a sound sleep. Jude,
dying of anxiety lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) should have caught a chill which might
permanently injure her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), was glad to hear the regular breathing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
softly went nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and observed that a warm flush now rosed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hitherto blue cheeks, and felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hanging hand was no
longer cold. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) back to the fire regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
and saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) almost a divinity.



<p/>IV


<p/>Jude's reverie was interrupted by the creak of footsteps ascending
the stairs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) whisked Sue's clothing from the chair where it was drying, thrust
it under the bed, and sat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) book. Somebody knocked and
opened the door immediately. It was the landlady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I didn't know whether you was in or not, Mr. Fawley. I
wanted to know if you would require supper. I see you've a young
gentleman--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am. But I think I won't come down to-night. Will you bring
supper up on a tray, and I'll have a cup of tea as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Jude's custom to go downstairs to the kitchen, and eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
meals with the family, to save trouble. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) landlady brought up the
supper, however, on this occasion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) at the
door.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had descended he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) set the teapot on the hob, and drew out
Sue's clothes anew; but they were far from dry. A thick woollen
gown, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found, held a deal of water. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hung them up again, and
enlarged his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fire and mused as the steam from the garments went up
the chimney.

<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Jude!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. All right. How do you feel now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better. Quite well. Why, I fell asleep, didn't I? What time is
it? Not late surely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is past ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it really? What SHALL I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, starting up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay where you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that's what I want to do. But I don't know what they would
say! And what will you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to sit here by the fire all night, and read. To-morrow
is Sunday, and I haven't to go out anywhere. Perhaps you will be
saved a severe illness by resting there. Don't be frightened. I'm
all right. Look here, what I have got for you. Some supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had sat upright she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) breathed plaintively and said, <div class="bookquote">``I do
feel rather weak still. I thought I was well; and I ought not to be
here, ought I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But the supper fortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) somewhat, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had had some tea and had lain back again she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was bright and cheerful.

<p/>The tea must have been green, or too long drawn, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) seemed
preternaturally wakeful afterwards, though Jude, who had not taken
any, began to feel heavy; till her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) conversation fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You called me a creature of civilization, or something, didn't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, breaking a silence. <div class="bookquote">``It was very odd you should have done
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, because it is provokingly wrong. I am a sort of negation of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You are very philosophical. <div class="bookquote">``A negation' is profound talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it? Do I strike you as being learned?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) asked, with a touch
of raillery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not learned. Only you don't talk quite like a girl--well, a
girl who has had no advantages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had advantages. I don't know Latin and Greek, though I know
the grammars of those tongues. But I know most of the Greek and
Latin classics through translations, and other books too. I read
Lemprière, Catullus, Martial, Juvenal, Lucian, Beaumont and Fletcher,
Boccaccio, Scarron, De Brantôme, Sterne, De Foe, Smollett, Fielding,
Shakespeare, the Bible, and other such; and found that all interest
in the unwholesome part of those books ended with its mystery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have read more than I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``How came you to
read some of those queerer ones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said thoughtfully, ``it was by accident. My life has been
entirely shaped by what people call a peculiarity in me. I have no
fear of men, as such, nor of their books. I have mixed with them--one
or two of them particularly--almost as one of their own sex. I mean
I have not felt about them as most women are taught to feel--to be on
their guard against attacks on their virtue; for no average man--no
man short of a sensual savage--will molest a woman by day or night,
at home or abroad, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) invites him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says by a look
<div class="bookquote">``Come on' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is always afraid to, and if you never say it, or look
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never comes. However, what I was going to say is that when I
was eighteen I formed a friendly intimacy with an undergraduate at
Christminster, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taught me a great deal, and lent me books which
I should never have got hold of otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your friendship broken off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died, poor fellow, two or three years after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) degree and left Christminster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw a good deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. We used to go about together--on walking tours, reading tours,
and things of that sort--like two men almost. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked me to live
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I agreed to by letter. But when I joined him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in London
I found he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant a different thing from what I meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted me
to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress, in fact, but I wasn't in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--and on
my saying I should go away if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't agree to MY plan, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
so. We shared a sitting-room for fifteen months; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became a
leader-writer for one of the great London dailies; till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was taken
ill, and had to go abroad. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said I was breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart by
holding out against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so long at such close quarters; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
never have believed it of woman. I might play that game once too
often, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came home merely to die. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death caused a
terrible remorse in me for my cruelty--though I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died of
consumption and not of me entirely. I went down to Sandbourne
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) funeral, and was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only mourner. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left me a little
money--because I broke his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart, I suppose. That's how men
are--so much better than women!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!--what did you do then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--now you are angry with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, a contralto note of
tragedy coming suddenly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) silvery voice. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't have
told you if I had known!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not. Tell me all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I invested his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, poor fellow, in a bubble scheme, and
lost it. I lived about London by myself for some time, and then I
returned to Christminster, as my father-- who was also in London, and
had started as an art metal-worker near Long-Acre--wouldn't have me
back; and I got that occupation in the artist-shop where you found
me... I said you didn't know how bad I was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude looked round upon the arm-chair and its occupant, as if to read
more carefully the creature he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had given shelter to. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) voice
trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``However you have lived, Sue, I believe you are
as innocent as you are unconventional!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not particularly innocent, as you see, now that I have


<p/>`twitched the robe
From that blank lay-figure your fancy draped,'''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), with an ostensible sneer, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
brimming with tears. <div class="bookquote">``But I have never yielded myself to any lover,
if that's what you mean! I have remained as I began.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite believe you. But some women would not have remained as they
began.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. Better women would not. People say I must be
cold-natured--sexless--on account of it. But I won't have it!
Some of the most passionately erotic poets have been the most
self-contained in their daily lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you told Mr. Phillotson about this university scholar friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--long ago. I have never made any secret of it to anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) did not pass any criticism--only said I was everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>),
whatever I did; and things like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude felt much depressed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) seemed to get further and further away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) strange ways and curious unconsciousness of gender.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you REALLY vexed with me, dear Jude?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) suddenly asked, in
a voice of such extraordinary tenderness that it hardly seemed to
come from the same woman who had just told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) story so lightly. <div class="bookquote">``I
would rather offend anybody in the world than you, I think!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether I am vexed or not. I know I care very much
about you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I care as much for you as for anybody I ever met.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't care MORE! There, I ought not to say that. Don't answer
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another long silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was treating
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cruelly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not quite say in what way. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) very
helplessness seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so much stronger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am awfully ignorant on general matters, although I have worked so
hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, to turn the subject. <div class="bookquote">``I am absorbed in theology, you
know. And what do you think I should be doing just about now, if you
weren't here? I should be saying my evening prayers. I suppose you
wouldn't like--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I would rather not, if you don't mind.
I should seem so--such a hypocrite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you wouldn't join, so I didn't propose it. You must
remember that I hope to be a useful minister some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be ordained, I think you said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you haven't given up the idea?--I thought that perhaps you had
by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. I fondly thought at first that you felt as I do
about that, as you were so mixed up in Christminster Anglicanism.
And Mr. Phillotson--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no respect for Christminster whatever, except, in a qualified
degree, on its intellectual side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue Bridehead earnestly. ``My
friend I spoke of took that out of me. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was the most irreligious
man I ever knew, and the most moral. And intellect at Christminster
is new wine in old bottles. The mediævalism of Christminster must
go, be sloughed off, or Christminster itself will have to go. To
be sure, at times one couldn't help having a sneaking liking for
the traditions of the old faith, as preserved by a section of the
thinkers there in touching and simple sincerity; but when I was in my
saddest, rightest mind I always felt,


<p/><div class="bookquote">``O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods!''' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>...


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue, you are not a good friend of mine to talk like that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I won't, dear Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The emotional throat-note had come back,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I still think Christminster has much that is glorious; though I
was resentful because I couldn't get there.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) spoke gently, and
resisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) impulse to pique her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on to tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an ignorant place, except as to the townspeople, artizans,
drunkards, and paupers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, perverse still at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) differing
from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``THEY see life as it is, of course; but few of the people
in the colleges do. You prove it in your own person. You are one
of the very men Christminster was intended for when the colleges
were founded; a man with a passion for learning, but no money, or
opportunities, or friends. But you were elbowed off the pavement
by the millionaires' sons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I can do without what it confers. I care for something
higher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I for something broader, truer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) insisted. <div class="bookquote">``At present
intellect in Christminster is pushing one way, and religion the
other; and so they stand stock-still, like two rams butting each
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would Mr. Phillotson--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a place full of fetishists and ghost-seers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) noticed that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tried to speak of the schoolmaster she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
turned the conversation to some generalizations about the offending
university. Jude was extremely, morbidly, curious about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life as
Phillotson's _protégée_ and betrothed; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not enlighten
him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's just what I am, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am fearful of life,
spectre-seeing always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are good and dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) heart bumped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in the Tractarian stage just now, are you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added,
putting on flippancy to hide real feeling, a common trick with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Let me see--when was I there? In the year eighteen hundred and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a sarcasm in that which is rather unpleasant to me, Sue.
Now will you do what I want you to? At this time I read a chapter,
and then say prayers, as I told you. Now will you concentrate your
attention on any book of these you like, and sit with your back to
me, and leave me to my custom? You are sure you won't join me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll look at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Don't tease, Sue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--I'll do just as you bid me, and I won't vex you, Jude,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied, in the tone of a child who was going to be good for ever
after, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) accordingly. A small Bible other
than the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was using lay near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and during his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) retreat she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
took it up, and turned over the leaves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said brightly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had finished and come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``will you let me make you a NEW New Testament, like the one I made
for myself at Christminster?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. How was that made?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I altered my old one by cutting up all the Epistles and Gospels into
separate _brochures_, and rearranging them in chronological order as
written, beginning the book with Thessalonians, following on with the
Epistles, and putting the Gospels much further on. Then I had the
volume rebound. My university friend Mr.--but never mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) name,
poor boy--said it was an excellent idea. I know that reading it
afterwards made it twice as interesting as before, and twice as
understandable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, with a sense of sacrilege.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what a literary enormity this is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glanced
into the pages of Solomon's Song. <div class="bookquote">``I mean the synopsis at the head
of each chapter, explaining away the real nature of that rhapsody.
You needn't be alarmed: nobody claims inspiration for the chapter
headings. Indeed, many divines treat them with contempt. It seems
the drollest thing to think of the four-and-twenty elders, or
bishops, or whatever number they were, sitting with long faces and
writing down such stuff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude looked pained. <div class="bookquote">``You are quite Voltairean!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed? Then I won't say any more, except that people have no
right to falsify the Bible! I HATE such hum-bug as could attempt to
plaster over with ecclesiastical abstractions such ecstatic, natural,
human love as lies in that great and passionate song!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) speech
had grown spirited, and almost petulant at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) rebuke, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes
moist. <div class="bookquote">``I WISH I had a friend here to support me; but nobody is ever
on my side!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my dear Sue, my very dear Sue, I am not against you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said,
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, and surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) introducing personal feeling
into mere argument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes you are, yes you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
might not see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brimming eyes. ``You are on the side of the people
in the training-school--at least you seem almost to be! What I
insist on is, that to explain such verses as this: ``Whither is thy
beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?<div class="bookquote">'' by the note: '_The Church
professeth her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faith_,''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>is supremely ridiculous!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, let it be! You make such a personal matter of
everything! I am--only too inclined just now to apply the words
profanely. You know YOU are fairest among women to me, come to
that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not to say it now!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sue replied, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice changing
to its softest note of severity. Then their eyes met, and they
shook hands like cronies in a tavern, and Jude saw the absurdity of
quarrelling on such a hypothetical subject, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the silliness of
crying about what was written in an old book like the Bible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't disturb your convictions--I really won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on
soothingly, for now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was rather more ruffled than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I did
want and long to ennoble some man to high aims; and when I saw you,
and knew you wanted to be my comrade, I--shall I confess it?--thought
that man might be you. But you take so much tradition on trust that
I don't know what to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear; I suppose one must take some things on trust. Life
isn't long enough to work out everything in Euclid problems before
you believe it. I take Christianity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps you might take something worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I might. Perhaps I have done so!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought of Arabella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't ask what, because we are going to be VERY nice with each
other, aren't we, and never, never, vex each other any more?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
looked up trustfully, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice seemed trying to nestle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall always care for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I for you. Because you are single-hearted, and forgiving to
your faulty and tiresome little Sue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked away, for that epicene tenderness of hers was too
harrowing. Was it that which had broken the heart of the poor
leader-writer; and was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to be the next one? ... But Sue was so
dear! ... If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could only get over the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sex, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
seemed to be able to do so easily of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), what a comrade she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would
make; for their difference of opinion on conjectural subjects only
drew them closer together on matters of daily human experience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
was nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) than any other woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had ever met, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could
scarcely believe that time, creed, or absence, would ever divide him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) grief at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) incredulities returned. They sat on till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
fell asleep again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) nodded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) chair likewise. Whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aroused himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) things, and made up the fire anew.
About six o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) awoke completely, and lighting a candle, found
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) clothes were dry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) chair being a far more comfortable
one than his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) still slept on inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) great-coat, looking warm
as a new bun and boyish as a Ganymede. Placing the garments by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
and touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) on the shoulder he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went downstairs, and washed
himself by starlight in the yard.



<p/>V


<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) returned she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was dressed as usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now could I get out without anybody seeing me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``The
town is not yet astir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have had no breakfast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't want any! I fear I ought not to have run away from that
school! Things seem so different in the cold light of morning, don't
they? What Mr. Phillotson will say I don't know! It was quite by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) wish that I went there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) is the only man in the world for whom
I have any respect or fear. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)'ll forgive me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)'ll scold
me dreadfully, I expect!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) and explain--''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>began Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, you shan't. I don't care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) may think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
likes--I shall do just as I choose!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you just this moment said--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if I did, I shall do as I like for all him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)! I have thought of
what I shall do--go to the sister of one of my fellow-students in the
training-school, who has asked me to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has a school
near Shaston, about eighteen miles from here--and I shall stay there
till this has blown over, and I get back to the training-school
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At the last moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) a cup of
coffee, in a portable apparatus he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) kept in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) room for use on rising
to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) work every day before the household was astir.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now a dew-bit to eat with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and off we go. You can
have a regular breakfast when you get there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They went quietly out of the house, Jude accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to the
station. As they departed along the street a head was thrust out
of an upper window of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lodging and quickly withdrawn. Sue still
seemed sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) rashness, and to wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had not rebelled;
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at parting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) know as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
got re-admitted to the training-school. They stood rather miserably
together on the platform; and it was apparent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wanted to say
more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you something--two things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said hurriedly as the
train came up. <div class="bookquote">``One is a warm one, the other a cold one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I know one of them. And you mustn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't love me. You are to like me--that's all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude's face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was
agitated in sympathy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) adieu through the carriage
window. And then the train moved on, and waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pretty hand to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) vanished away.



<p/>Melchester was a dismal place enough for Jude that Sunday of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
departure, and the Close so hateful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not go once to the
cathedral services. The next morning there came a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>),
which, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) usual promptitude, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had written directly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) friend's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) safe arrival and
comfortable quarters, and then added:--


<p/>What I really write about, dear Jude, is something I said
to you at parting. You had been so very good and kind to
me that when you were out of sight I felt what a cruel and
ungrateful woman I was to say it, and it has reproached me
ever since. IF YOU WANT TO LOVE ME, JUDE, YOU MAY: I don't
mind at all; and I'll never say again that you mustn't!

<p/>Now I won't write any more about that. You do forgive your
thoughtless friend for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cruelty? and won't make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
miserable by saying you don't?--Ever,

<p/>SUE.


<p/>It would be superfluous to say what his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) answer was; and how he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
thought what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would have done had he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) been free, which should have
rendered a long residence with a female friend quite unnecessary for
Sue. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might have been pretty sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own victory if
it had come to a conflict between Phillotson and himself for the
possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>Yet Jude was in danger of attaching more meaning to Sue's impulsive
note than it really was intended to bear.

<p/>After the lapse of a few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found himself hoping that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would
write again. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) received no further communication; and in the
intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) solicitude he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sent another note, suggesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
should pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) a visit some Sunday, the distance being under eighteen
miles.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) expected a reply on the second morning after despatching his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
missive; but none came. The third morning arrived; the postman did
not stop. This was Saturday, and in a feverish state of anxiety
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) sent off three brief lines stating that he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) was coming
the following day, for he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) felt sure something had happened.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) first and natural thought had been that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was ill from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
immersion; but it soon occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) that somebody would have
written for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in such a case. Conjectures were put an end to by
his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) arrival at the village school-house near Shaston on the bright
morning of Sunday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, when the parish
was as vacant as a desert, most of the inhabitants having gathered
inside the church, whence their voices could occasionally be heard in
unison.

<p/>A little girl opened the door. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Bridehead is up-stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``And will you please walk up to her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>asked Jude hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a little--not very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude entered and ascended. On reaching the landing a voice told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
which way to turn--the voice of Sue calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) name. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) passed the
doorway, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lying in a little bed in a room a dozen feet
square.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cried, sitting down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``How is this! You couldn't write?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--it wasn't that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I did catch a bad cold--but I
could have written. Only I wouldn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?--frightening me like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--that was what I was afraid of! But I had decided not to write
to you any more. They won't have me back at the school--that's why I
couldn't write. Not the fact, but the reason!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They not only won't have me, but they gave me a parting piece of
advice--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not answer directly. <div class="bookquote">``I vowed I never would tell you,
Jude--it is so vulgar and distressing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it about us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do tell me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--somebody has sent them baseless reports about us, and they
say you and I ought to marry as soon as possible, for the sake of my
reputation! ... There--now I have told you, and I wish I hadn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, poor Sue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think of you like that means! It did just OCCUR to me to
regard you in the way they think I do, but I hadn't begun to. I HAVE
recognized that the cousinship was merely nominal, since we met as
total strangers. But my marrying you, dear Jude--why, of course,
if I had reckoned upon marrying you I shouldn't have come to you so
often! And I never supposed you thought of such a thing as marrying
me till the other evening; when I began to fancy you did love me a
little. Perhaps I ought not to have been so intimate with you. It
is all my fault. Everything is my fault always!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The speech seemed a little forced and unreal, and they regarded each
other with a mutual distress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was so blind at first!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't see what you felt
at all. Oh, you have been unkind to me--you have--to look upon me
as a sweetheart without saying a word, and leaving me to discover it
myself! Your attitude to me has become known; and naturally they
think we've been doing wrong! I'll never trust you again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sue,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said simply; <div class="bookquote">``I am to blame--more than you think. I
was quite aware that you did not suspect till within the last meeting
or two what I was feeling about you. I admit that our meeting as
strangers prevented a sense of relationship, and that it was a sort
of subterfuge to avail myself of it. But don't you think I deserve a
little consideration for concealing my wrong, very wrong, sentiments,
since I couldn't help having them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes doubtfully towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and then looked away as
if afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) might forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>By every law of nature and sex a kiss was the only rejoinder that
fitted the mood and the moment, under the suasion of which Sue's
undemonstrative regard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might not inconceivably have changed
its temperature. Some men would have cast scruples to the winds,
and ventured it, oblivious both of Sue's declaration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) neutral
feelings, and of the pair of autographs in the vestry chest of
Arabella's parish church. Jude did not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had, in fact, come in
part to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own fatal story. It was upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lips; yet at the
hour of this distress he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not disclose it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) preferred to
dwell upon the recognized barriers between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course--I know you don't--care about me in any particular way,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sorrowed. <div class="bookquote">``You ought not, and you are right. You belong to--Mr.
Phillotson. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) has been to see you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said shortly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face changing a little. <div class="bookquote">``Though I
didn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) to come. You are glad, of course, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) has been!
But I shouldn't care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) didn't come any more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very perplexing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lover that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) should be piqued at his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
honest acquiescence in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) rival, if Jude's feelings of love were
deprecated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) went on to something else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This will blow over, dear Sue,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The training-school
authorities are not all the world. You can get to be a student in
some other, no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask Mr. Phillotson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said decisively.

<p/>Sue's kind hostess now returned from church, and there was no more
intimate conversation. Jude left in the afternoon, hopelessly
unhappy. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), and sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>). Such intercourse
as that would have to content him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) for the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) life.
The lesson of renunciation it was necessary and proper that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), as
a parish priest, should learn.

<p/>But the next morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) awoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt rather vexed with her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>),
and decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was rather unreasonable, not to say capricious.
Then, in illustration of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had begun to discern as one of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
redeeming characteristics there came promptly a note, which she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) must
have written almost immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had gone from her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>):


<p/>Forgive me for my petulance yesterday! I was horrid to
you; I know it, and I feel perfectly miserable at my
horridness. It was so dear of you not to be angry! Jude,
please still keep me as your friend and associate, with
all my faults. I'll try not to be like it again.

<p/>I am coming to Melchester on Saturday, to get my things
away from the T. S., &c. I could walk with you for half
an hour, if you would like?--Your repentant

<p/>SUE.


<p/>Jude forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) straightway, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to call for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at the
cathedral works when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came.



<p/>VI


<p/>Meanwhile a middle-aged man was dreaming a dream of great beauty
concerning the writer of the above letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was Richard
Phillotson, who had recently removed from the mixed village school at
Lumsdon near Christminster, to undertake a large boys' school in his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
native town of Shaston, which stood on a hill sixty miles to the
south-west as the crow flies.

<p/>A glance at the place and its accessories was almost enough to reveal
that the schoolmaster's plans and dreams so long indulged in had
been abandoned for some new dream with which neither the Church nor
literature had much in common. Essentially an unpractical man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was now bent on making and saving money for a practical purpose--that
of keeping a wife, who, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chose, might conduct one of the girls'
schools adjoining his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own; for which purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had advised her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to go
into training, since she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offhand.

<p/>About the time that Jude was removing from Marygreen to Melchester,
and entering on adventures at the latter place with Sue, the
schoolmaster was settling down in the new school-house at Shaston.
All the furniture being fixed, the books shelved, and the nails
driven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had begun to sit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) parlour during the dark winter
nights and re-attempt some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old studies--one branch of
which had included Roman-Britannic antiquities--an unremunerative
labour for a national school-master but a subject, that, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
abandonment of the university scheme, had interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as being a
comparatively unworked mine; practicable to those who, like himself,
had lived in lonely spots where these remains were abundant, and were
seen to compel inferences in startling contrast to accepted views on
the civilization of that time.

<p/>A resumption of this investigation was the outward and apparent hobby
of Phillotson at present--his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) ostensible reason for going alone into
fields where causeways, dykes, and tumuli abounded, or shutting
himself up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) house with a few urns, tiles, and mosaics he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had
collected, instead of calling round upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) new neighbours, who for
their part had showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). But it was not the real, or the whole, reason, after all.
Thus on a particular evening in the month, when it had grown quite
late--to near midnight, indeed--and the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) lamp, shining
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) window at a salient angle of the hill-top town over infinite
miles of valley westward, announced as by words a place and person
given over to study, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was not exactly studying.

<p/>The interior of the room--the books, the furniture, the
schoolmaster's loose coat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) attitude at the table, even the
flickering of the fire, bespoke the same dignified tale of
undistracted research--more than creditable to a man who had had no
advantages beyond those of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own making. And yet the tale, true
enough till latterly, was not true now. What he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was regarding was
not history. They were historic notes, written in a bold womanly
hand at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dictation some months before, and it was the clerical
rendering of word after word that absorbed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presently took from a drawer a carefully tied bundle of letters,
few, very few, as correspondence counts nowadays. Each was in its
envelope just as it had arrived, and the handwriting was of the same
womanly character as the historic notes. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) unfolded them one by
one and read them musingly. At first sight there seemed in these
small documents to be absolutely nothing to muse over. They were
straightforward, frank letters, signed <div class="bookquote">``Sue B--'' (<font color='red'><b>ones</b></font>)</div>; just such ones as
would be written during short absences, with no other thought than
their speedy destruction, and chiefly concerning books in reading
and other experiences of a training school, forgotten doubtless by
the writer with the passing of the day of their inditing. In one of
them--quite a recent note--the young woman said that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had received
his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) considerate letter, and that it was honourable and generous of
him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) to say he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) would not come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) oftener than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desired -LRB-the
school being such an awkward place for callers, and because of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
strong wish that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) engagement to him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) should not be known, which it
would infallibly be if he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) visited her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) often-RRB-. Over these phrases the
school-master pored. What precise shade of satisfaction was to be
gathered from a woman's gratitude that the man who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not
been often to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? The problem occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), distracted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened another drawer, and found therein an envelope, from which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew a photograph of Sue as a child, long before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>),
standing under trellis-work with a little basket in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand. There
was another of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) as a young woman, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) dark eyes and hair making a
very distinct and attractive picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), which just disclosed,
too, the thoughtfulness that lay behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lighter moods. It was
a duplicate of the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had given Jude, and would have given to
any man. Phillotson brought it half-way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) lips, but withdrew
it in doubt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) perplexing phrases: ultimately kissing the
dead pasteboard with all the passionateness, and more than all the
devotion, of a young man of eighteen.

<p/>The schoolmaster's was an unhealthy-looking, old-fashioned face,
rendered more old-fashioned by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) style of shaving. A certain
gentlemanliness had been imparted to it by nature, suggesting an
inherent wish to do rightly by all. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech was a little slow,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tones were sincere enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitation no defect.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) greying hair was curly, and radiated from a point in the middle
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crown. There were four lines across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only
wore spectacles when reading at night. It was almost certainly a
renunciation forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) academic purpose, rather than a
distaste for women, which had hitherto kept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from closing with one
of the sex in matrimony.

<p/>Such silent proceedings as those of this evening were repeated many
and oft times when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not under the eye of the boys, whose quick
and penetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to
the self-conscious master in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) present anxious care for Sue, making
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), in the grey hours of morning, dread to meet anew the gimlet
glances, lest they should read what the dream within him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had honourably acquiesced in Sue's announced wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was
not often to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) at the training school; but at length, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
patience being sorely tried, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) set out one Saturday afternoon to pay
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) an unexpected call. There the news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) departure--expulsion
as it might almost have been considered--was flashed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) without
warning or mitigation as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stood at the door expecting in a few
minutes to behold her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) turned away he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could hardly
see the road before him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).

<p/>Sue had, in fact, never written a line to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) suitor on the subject,
although it was fourteen days old. A short reflection told him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) that
this proved nothing, a natural delicacy being as ample a reason for
silence as any degree of blameworthiness.

<p/>They had informed him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) at the school where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was living, and having
no immediate anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) comfort, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) thoughts took the
direction of a burning indignation against the training school
committee. In his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bewilderment Phillotson entered the adjacent
cathedral, just now in a direly dismantled state by reason of
the repairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sat down on a block of freestone, regardless of
the dusty imprint it made on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) breeches; and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) listless eyes
following the movements of the workmen he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) presently became aware
that the reputed culprit, Sue's lover Jude, was one amongst them.

<p/>Jude had never spoken to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) former hero since the meeting by the
model of Jerusalem. Having inadvertently witnessed Phillotson's
tentative courtship of Sue in the lane there had grown up in the
younger man's mind a curious dislike to think of the elder, to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), to communicate in any way with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and since Phillotson's
success in obtaining at least her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) promise had become known to Jude,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had frankly recognized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not wish to see or hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
senior any more, learn anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pursuits, or even imagine
again what excellencies might appertain to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) character. On this
very day of the schoolmaster's visit Jude was expecting Sue, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had promised; and when therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw the schoolmaster in the nave
of the building, saw, moreover, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was coming to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt no little embarrassment; which Phillotson's own embarrassment
prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) observing.

<p/>Jude joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and they both withdrew from the other workmen to the
spot where Phillotson had been sitting. Jude offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) a piece of
sackcloth for a cushion, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) it was dangerous to sit on the
bare block.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson abstractedly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) reseated himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
eyes resting on the ground as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) were trying to remember where he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
was. <div class="bookquote">``I won't keep you long. It was merely that I have heard that
you have seen my little friend Sue recently. It occurred to me to
speak to you on that account. I merely want to ask--about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I know what!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude hurriedly said. <div class="bookquote">``About her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) escaping
from the training school, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) coming to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well'' (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>--Jude for a moment felt an unprincipled and fiendish wish to
annihilate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) rival at all cost. By the exercise of that treachery
which love for the same woman renders possible to men the most
honourable in every other relation of life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could send off
Phillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true,
and that Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). But his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
action did not respond for a moment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) animal instinct; and what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said was, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad of your kindness in coming to talk plainly to
me about it. You know what they say?--that I ought to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I wish with all my soul I could!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>Phillotson trembled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) naturally pale face acquired a
corpselike sharpness in its lines. <div class="bookquote">``I had no idea that it was of
this nature! God forbid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude aghast. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you understood? I mean that
were I in a position to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), or someone, and settle down,
instead of living in lodgings here and there, I should be glad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had really meant was simply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But--since this painful matter has been opened up--what really
happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>asked Phillotson, with the firmness of a man who felt that
a sharp smart now was better than a long agony of suspense hereafter.
<div class="bookquote">``Cases arise, and this is one, when even ungenerous questions must be
put to make false assumptions impossible, and to kill scandal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude explained readily; giving the whole series of adventures,
including the night at the shepherd's, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wet arrival at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
lodging, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) indisposition from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) immersion, their vigil of
discussion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) off next morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson at the conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``I take it as your
final word, and I know I can believe you, that the suspicion which
led to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) rustication is an absolutely baseless one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``Absolutely. So help me God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The schoolmaster</b></font>)</div><p/>The schoolmaster rose. Each of the twain felt that the interview
could not comfortably merge in a friendly discussion of their recent
experiences, after the manner of friends; and when Jude had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
round, and shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) some features of the renovation which the old
cathedral was undergoing, Phillotson bade the young man good-day and
went away.

<p/>This visit took place about eleven o'clock in the morning; but no Sue
appeared. When Jude went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dinner at one he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) beloved
ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in the street leading up from the North Gate, walking
as if no way looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). Speedily overtaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remarked
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at the cathedral, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
promised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been to get my things from the college,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said--an
observation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was expected to take as an answer, though it was
not one. Finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to be in this evasive mood he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt inclined to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) the information so long withheld.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not seen Mr. Phillotson to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ventured to inquire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not. But I am not going to be cross-examined about him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>); and
if you ask anything more I won't answer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very odd that--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stopped, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you are often not so nice in your real presence as you are in
your letters!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it really seem so to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), smiling with quick
curiosity. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that's strange; but I feel just the same about
you, Jude. When you are gone away I seem such a coldhearted--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sentiment towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) Jude saw that they were getting
upon dangerous ground. It was now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) must speak as
an honest man.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not speak, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``It was that which made me
write and say--I didn't mind your loving me--if you wanted to, much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The exultation he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might have felt at what that implied, or seemed to
imply, was nullified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) intention, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) rested rigid till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
began: <div class="bookquote">``I have never told you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes you have,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>murmured she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, I have never told you my history--all of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I guess it. I know nearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude looked up. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) possibly know of that morning performance
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with Arabella; which in a few months had ceased to be a
marriage more completely than by death? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't quite tell you here in the street,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went on with a gloomy
tongue. <div class="bookquote">``And you had better not come to my lodgings. Let us go in
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The building by which they stood was the market-house; it was the
only place available; and they entered, the market being over, and
the stalls and areas empty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would have preferred a more congenial
spot, but, as usually happens, in place of a romantic field or solemn
aisle for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tale, it was told while they walked up and down over a
floor littered with rotten cabbage-leaves, and amid all the usual
squalors of decayed vegetable matter and unsaleable refuse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
began and finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) brief narrative, which merely led up to the
information that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had married a wife some years earlier, and that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife was living still. Almost before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) countenance had time to
change she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hurried out the words,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell me before!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't. It seemed so cruel to tell it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To yourself, Jude. So it was better to be cruel to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>cried Jude passionately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tried to take her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) withdrew it. Their old relations of confidence seemed
suddenly to have ended, and the antagonisms of sex to sex were left
without any counter-poising predilections. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) comrade,
friend, unconscious sweetheart no longer; and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
in estranged silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was ashamed of the episode in my life which brought about the
marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``I can't explain it precisely now. I could
have done it if you had taken it differently!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) burst out. <div class="bookquote">``Here I have been saying, or
writing, that--that you might love me, or something of the
sort!--just out of charity--and all the time--oh, it is perfectly
damnable how things are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) foot in a nervous
quiver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You take me wrong, Sue! I never thought you cared for me at all,
till quite lately; so I felt it did not matter! Do you care for me,
Sue?--you know how I mean?--I don't like `out of charity' at all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a question which in the circumstances Sue did not choose to
answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)--your wife--is--a very pretty woman, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s
wicked?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s pretty enough, as far as that goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prettier than I am, no doubt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not the least alike. And I have never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for
years... But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s sure to come back--they always do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange of you to stay apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like this!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue lip</b></font>)</div>said Sue,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) trembling lip and lumpy throat belying her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) irony. <div class="bookquote">``You, such a
religious man. How will the demi-gods in your Pantheon--I mean those
legendary persons you call saints--intercede for you after this?
Now if I had done such a thing it would have been different, and not
remarkable, for I at least don't regard marriage as a sacrament.
Your theories are not so advanced as your practice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue, you are terribly cutting when you like to be--a perfect
Voltaire! But you must treat me as you will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) saw how wretched he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) softened, and trying to blink
away her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sympathetic tears said with all the winning reproachfulness
of a heart-hurt woman: <div class="bookquote">``Ah--you should have told me before you gave
me that idea that you wanted to be allowed to love me! I had no
feeling before that moment at the railway-station, except--''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>For
once Sue was as miserable as he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) attempts to keep herself free
from emotion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) less than half-success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) implored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am--not crying--because I meant to--love you; but because of your
want of--confidence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They were quite screened from the market-square without, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) could
not help putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) arm towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) waist. His (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) momentary desire
was the means of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) rallying. <div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, drawing back
stringently, and wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Of course not! It would be
hypocrisy to pretend that it would be meant as from my cousin; and it
can't be in any other way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div><p/>They moved on a dozen paces, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) showed herself recovered. It
was distracting to Jude, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heart would have ached less had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
appeared anyhow but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did appear; essentially large-minded and
generous on reflection, despite a previous exercise of those narrow
womanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sex.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't blame you for what you couldn't help,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``How should I be so foolish? I do blame you a little bit for not
telling me before. But, after all, it doesn't matter. We should
have had to keep apart, you see, even if this had not been in your
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we shouldn't, Sue! This is the only obstacle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget that I must have loved you, and wanted to be your
wife, even if there had been no obstacle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue, with a gentle
seriousness which did not reveal her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``And then we are cousins,
and it is bad for cousins to marry. And--I am engaged to somebody
else. As to our going on together as we were going, in a sort of
friendly way, the people round us would have made it unable to
continue. Their views of the relations of man and woman are limited,
as is proved by their expelling me from the school. Their philosophy
only recognizes relations based on animal desire. The wide field
of strong attachment where desire plays, at least, only a secondary
part, is ignored by them--the part of--who is it?--Venus Urania.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) being able to talk learnedly showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was mistress of
herself again; and before they parted she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had almost regained her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
vivacious glance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) reciprocity of tone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) gay manner, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
second-thought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
age and sex.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could speak more freely now. <div class="bookquote">``There were several reasons against
my telling you rashly. One was what I have said; another, that
it was always impressed upon me that I ought not to marry--that
I belonged to an odd and peculiar family--the wrong breed for
marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--who used to say that to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My great-aunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) said it always ended badly with us Fawleys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's strange. My father used to say the same to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They stood possessed by the same thought, ugly enough, even as an
assumption: that a union between them, had such been possible, would
have meant a terrible intensification of unfitness--two bitters in
one dish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but there can't be anything in it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said with nervous
lightness. <div class="bookquote">``Our family have been unlucky of late years in choosing
mates--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousins friends correspondents</b></font>)</div><p/>And then they pretended to persuade themselves that all that had
happened was of no consequence, and that they could still be cousins
and friends and warm correspondents, and have happy genial times
when they met, even if they met less frequently than before. Their
parting was in good friendship, and yet Jude's last look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
eyes was tinged with inquiry, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not even now
quite know her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) mind.



<p/>VII


<p/>Tidings from Sue a day or two after passed across Jude like a
withering blast.

<p/>Before reading the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was led to suspect that its contents
were of a somewhat serious kind by catching sight of the
signature--which was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) full name, never used in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
correspondence with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) first note:


<p/>MY DEAR JUDE,--I have something to tell you which perhaps
you will not be surprised to hear, though certainly it may
strike you as being accelerated -LRB-as the railway companies
say of their trains-RRB-. Mr. Phillotson and I are to be married
quite soon--in three or four weeks. We had intended, as you
know, to wait till I had gone through my course of training
and obtained my certificate, so as to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), if
necessary, in the teaching. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) generously says he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) does
not see any object in waiting, now I am not at the training
school. It is so good of him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), because the awkwardness of my
situation has really come about by my fault in getting
expelled.

<p/>Wish me joy. Remember I say you are to, and you mustn't
refuse!--Your affectionate cousin,

<p/>SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.


<p/>Jude staggered under the news; could eat no breakfast; and kept on
drinking tea because his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mouth was so dry. Then presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) work and laughed the usual bitter laugh of a man so
confronted. Everything seemed turning to satire. And yet, what
could the poor girl do? he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) asked himself, and felt worse than
shedding tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Susanna Florence Mary!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) worked. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know
what marriage means!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Could it be possible that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) announcement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own marriage had
pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on to this, just as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when in liquor may
have pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) engagement? To be sure, there seemed to
exist these other and sufficient reasons, practical and social, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) decision; but Sue was not a very practical or calculating person;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was compelled to think that a pique at having his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) secret
sprung upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to give way to Phillotson's probable
representations, that the best course to prove how unfounded were the
suspicions of the school authorities would be to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) off-hand,
as in fulfilment of an ordinary engagement. Sue had, in fact, been
placed in an awkward corner. Poor Sue!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) determined to play the Spartan; to make the best of it, and
support her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could not write the requested good wishes for a
day or two. Meanwhile there came another note from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) impatient
little dear:


<p/>Jude, will you give me away? I have nobody else who could
do it so conveniently as you, being the only married relation
I have here on the spot, even if my father were friendly
enough to be willing, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) isn't. I hope you won't think
it a trouble? I have been looking at the marriage service in
the prayer-book, and it seems to me very humiliating that a
giver-away should be required at all. According to the
ceremony as there printed, my bridegroom chooses me of his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>)
own will and pleasure; but I don't choose him (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>). Somebody
GIVES me to him (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>), like a she-ass or she-goat, or any other
domestic animal. Bless your exalted views of woman, O
churchman! But I forget: I am no longer privileged to tease
you.--Ever,

<p/>SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.


<p/>Jude screwed himself up to heroic key; and replied:


<p/>MY DEAR SUE,--Of course I wish you joy! And also of course
I will give you away. What I suggest is that, as you have
no house of your own, you do not marry from your school
friend's, but from mine. It would be more proper, I think,
since I am, as you say, the person nearest related to you in
this part of the world.

<p/>I don't see why you sign your letter in such a new and
terribly formal way? Surely you care a bit about me
still!--Ever your affectionate,

<p/>JUDE.


<p/>What had jarred on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) even more than the signature was a little
sting he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been silent on--the phrase <div class="bookquote">``married relation'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--What an
idiot it made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seem as her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) lover! If Sue had written that in
satire, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could hardly forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>); if in suffering--ah, that was
another thing!

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lodging must have commended itself to Phillotson
at any rate, for the schoolmaster sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) a line of warm thanks,
accepting the convenience. Sue also thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). Jude immediately
moved into more commodious quarters, as much to escape the espionage
of the suspicious landlady who had been one cause of Sue's unpleasant
experience as for the sake of room.

<p/>Then Sue wrote to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) the day fixed for the wedding; and Jude
decided, after inquiry, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) should come into residence on the
following Saturday, which would allow of a ten days' stay in the city
prior to the ceremony, sufficiently representing a nominal residence
of fifteen.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) arrived by the ten o'clock train on the day aforesaid, Jude not
going to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) at the station, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) special request, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
should not lose a morning's work and pay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said -LRB-if this were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) true reason-RRB-. But so well by this time did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) know Sue that the
remembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought, have weighed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in this. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) came home to
dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had taken possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) apartment.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lived in the same house with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), but on a different floor, and
they saw each other little, an occasional supper being the only meal
they took together, when Sue's manner was something like that of a
scared child. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not know; their conversation was
mechanical, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not look pale or ill. Phillotson came
frequently, but mostly when Jude was absent. On the morning of the
wedding, when Jude had given himself a holiday, Sue and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cousin
had breakfast together for the first and last time during this
curious interval; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) room--the parlour--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had hired for
the period of Sue's residence. Seeing, as women do, how helpless he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
was in making the place comfortable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bustled about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, Jude?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said suddenly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was leaning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) elbows on the table and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
hands, looking into a futurity which seemed to be sketched out on the
tablecloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are `father', you know. That's what they call the man who gives
you away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude could have said <div class="bookquote">``Phillotson's age entitles him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) to be called
that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would not annoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) by such a cheap retort.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) talked incessantly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) indulgence in
reflection, and before the meal was over both he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wished they
had not put such confidence in their new view of things, and had
taken breakfast apart. What oppressed Jude was the thought that,
having done a wrong thing of this sort himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was aiding and
abetting the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) loved in doing a like wrong thing, instead of
imploring and warning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) against it. It was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tongue to say,
<div class="bookquote">``You have quite made up your mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After breakfast they went out on an errand together moved by a mutual
thought that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging
in unceremonious companionship. By the irony of fate, and the
curious trick in Sue's nature of tempting Providence at critical
times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm as they walked through the muddy street--a
thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had never done before in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) life--and on turning the
corner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church
with a low-pitched roof--the church of St. Thomas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where I am going to be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) exclaimed with curiosity. <div class="bookquote">``How I should like to go in
and see what the spot is like where I am so soon to kneel and do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) does not realize what marriage means!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) passively acquiesced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wish to go in, and they entered by
the western door. The only person inside the gloomy building was
a charwoman cleaning. Sue still held Jude's arm, almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). Cruelly sweet, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) that morning;
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thoughts of a penance in store for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) were tempered by an
ache:


<p/>... I can find no way
How a blow should fall, such as falls on men,
Nor prove too much for your womanhood!


<p/>They strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar
railing, which they stood against in silence, turning then and
walking down the nave again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand still on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm, precisely
like a couple just married. The too suggestive incident, entirely
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) making, nearly broke down Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to do things like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said in the delicate voice of an
epicure in emotions, which left no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) spoke the truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are interesting, because they have probably never been done
before. I shall walk down the church like this with my husband in
about two hours, shan't I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt you will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it like this when you were married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God, Sue--don't be so awfully merciless! ... There, dear one,
I didn't mean it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--you are vexed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said regretfully, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) blinked away an
access of eye moisture. <div class="bookquote">``And I promised never to vex you! ... I
suppose I ought not to have asked you to bring me in here. Oh, I
oughtn't! I see it now. My curiosity to hunt up a new sensation
always leads me into these scrapes. Forgive me! ... You will, won't
you, Jude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>The appeal was so remorseful that Jude's eyes were even wetter than
hers as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand for Yes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we'll hurry away, and I won't do it any more!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) continued
humbly; and they came out of the building, Sue intending to go
on to the station to meet Phillotson. But the first person they
encountered on entering the main street was the schoolmaster himself,
whose train had arrived sooner than Sue expected. There was nothing
really to demur to in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) leaning on Jude's arm; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
hand, and Jude thought that Phillotson had looked surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been doing such a funny thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), smiling candidly.
<div class="bookquote">``We've been to the church, rehearsing as it were. Haven't we, Jude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson curiously.

<p/>Jude inwardly deplored what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought to be unnecessary frankness;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had gone too far not to explain all, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) accordingly
did, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) how they had marched up to the altar.

<p/>Seeing how puzzled Phillotson seemed, Jude said as cheerfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
could, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) another little present. Will you both
come to the shop with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue/Sue Bridehead/Bridehead</b></font>)</div>said Sue, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go on to the house with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>Sue/Sue Bridehead/Bridehead</b></font>)</div>; and requesting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lover not to be a long time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) departed with the schoolmaster.

<p/>Jude soon joined them at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) rooms, and shortly after they prepared
for the ceremony. Phillotson's hair was brushed to a painful
extent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) shirt collar appeared stiffer than it had been for
the previous twenty years. Beyond this he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) looked dignified and
thoughtful, and altogether a man of whom it was not unsafe to predict
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) would make a kind and considerate husband. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) adored
Sue was obvious; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could almost be seen to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
undeserving his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) adoration.

<p/>Although the distance was so short he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had hired a fly from the Red
Lion, and six or seven women and children had gathered by the door
when they came out. The schoolmaster and Sue were unknown, though
Jude was getting to be recognized as a citizen; and the couple were
judged to be some relations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) from a distance, nobody supposing
Sue to have been a recent pupil at the training school.

<p/>In the carriage Jude took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pocket his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) extra little
wedding-present, which turned out to be two or three yards of white
tulle, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) threw over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bonnet and all, as a veil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks so odd over a bonnet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll take the bonnet
off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--let it stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) obeyed.

<p/>When they had passed up the church and were standing in their places
Jude found that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge
of this performance, but by the time they were half-way on with the
service he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had not undertaken the
business of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) away. How could Sue have had the temerity to
ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to do it--a cruelty possibly to herself as well as to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)?
Women were different from men in such matters. Was it that they
were, instead of more sensitive, as reputed, more callous, and less
romantic; or were they more heroic? Or was Sue simply so perverse
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wilfully gave herself and him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pain for the odd and mournful
luxury of practising long-suffering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own person, and of being
touched with tender pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at having made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) practise it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
could perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face was nervously set, and when they reached
the trying ordeal of Jude giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to Phillotson she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could hardly
command herself; rather, however, as it seemed, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knowledge of
what her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cousin must feel, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) need not have had there at all,
than from self-consideration. Possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would go on inflicting
such pains again and again, and grieving for the sufferer again and
again, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) colossal inconsistency.

<p/>Phillotson seemed not to notice, to be surrounded by a mist which
prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) seeing the emotions of others. As soon as they had
signed their names and come away, and the suspense was over, Jude
felt relieved.

<p/>The meal at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lodging was a very simple affair, and at two o'clock
they went off. In crossing the pavement to the fly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked back;
and there was a frightened light in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes. Could it be that Sue
had acted with such unusual foolishness as to plunge into she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knew
not what for the sake of asserting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) independence of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), of
retaliating on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) secrecy? Perhaps Sue was thus venturesome
with men because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was childishly ignorant of that side of their
natures which wore out women's hearts and lives.

<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) foot was on the carriage-step she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) turned round, saying that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had forgotten something. Jude and the landlady offered to get
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, running back. <div class="bookquote">``It is my handkerchief. I know where
I left it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had found it, and came holding it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own tearful ones, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
lips suddenly parted as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) were going to avow something. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
went on; and whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had meant to say remained unspoken.



<p/>VIII


<p/>Jude wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had really left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) handkerchief behind; or
whether it were that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had miserably wished to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) of a love
that at the last moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could not bring herself to express.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not stay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) silent lodging when they were gone, and
fearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might be tempted to drown his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) misery in alcohol he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
went upstairs, changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dark clothes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) white, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thin boots
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thick, and proceeded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) customary work for the afternoon.

<p/>But in the cathedral he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed to hear a voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and to
be possessed with an idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would come back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could not
possibly go home with Phillotson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) fancied. The feeling grew and
stirred. The moment that the clock struck the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) working
hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) tools and rushed homeward. <div class="bookquote">``Has anybody been
for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Nobody had been there.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could claim the downstairs sitting-room till twelve o'clock
that night he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) sat in it all the evening; and even when the clock had
struck eleven, and the family had retired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could not shake off
the feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would come back and sleep in the little room
adjoining his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) own in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had slept so many previous days. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
actions were always unpredictable: why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) not come? Gladly
would he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) have compounded for the denial of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) as a sweetheart and
wife by having her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) live thus as a fellow-lodger and friend, even on
the most distant terms. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) supper still remained spread, and going
to the front door, and softly setting it open, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) returned to the
room and sat as watchers sit on Old-Midsummer eves, expecting the
phantom of the Beloved. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not come.

<p/>Having indulged in this wild hope he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went upstairs, and looked out of
the window, and pictured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) through the evening journey to London,
whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) and Phillotson had gone for their holiday; their rattling
along through the damp night to their hotel, under the same sky of
ribbed cloud as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) beheld, through which the moon showed its
position rather than its shape, and one or two of the larger stars
made themselves visible as faint nebulæ only. It was a new
beginning of Sue's history. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) projected his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) mind into the future,
and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) with children more or less in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own likeness around
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). But the consolation of regarding them as a continuation of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) identity was denied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), as to all such dreamers, by the
wilfulness of Nature in not allowing issue from one parent alone.
Every desired renewal of an existence is debased by being half alloy.
<div class="bookquote">``If at the estrangement or death of my lost love, I could go and see
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) child--hers solely--there would be comfort in it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) again uneasily saw, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had latterly seen with more and
more frequency, the scorn of Nature for man's finer emotions, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
lack of interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aspirations.

<p/>The oppressive strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection for Sue showed itself on
the morrow and following days yet more clearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could no longer
endure the light of the Melchester lamps; the sunshine was as drab
paint, and the blue sky as zinc. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) received news that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old
aunt was dangerously ill at Marygreen, which intelligence almost
coincided with a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) former employer at Christminster,
who offered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) permanent work of a good class if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would come back.
The letters were almost a relief to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started to visit Aunt
Drusilla, and resolved to go onward to Christminster to see what
worth there might be in the builder's offer.

<p/>Jude found his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt even worse than the communication from the Widow
Edlin had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to expect. There was every possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>)
lingering on for weeks or months, though little likelihood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wrote
to Sue informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) of the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) aunt, and suggesting that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) might like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) aged relative alive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) at
Alfredston Road, the following evening, Monday, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) way back from
Christminster, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) could come by the up-train which crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
down-train at that station. Next morning, according, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went on to
Christminster, intending to return to Alfredston soon enough to keep
the suggested appointment with Sue.

<p/>The city of learning wore an estranged look, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had lost all
feeling for its associations. Yet as the sun made vivid lights
and shades of the mullioned architecture of the façades, and drew
patterns of the crinkled battlements on the young turf of the
quadrangles, Jude thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had never seen the place look more
beautiful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) came to the street in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had first beheld Sue.
The chair she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had occupied when, leaning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) ecclesiastical
scrolls, a hog-hair brush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) girlish figure had
arrested the gaze of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) inquiring eyes, stood precisely in its
former spot, empty. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) were dead, and nobody had been
found capable of succeeding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in that artistic pursuit. Hers was
now the city phantom, while those of the intellectual and devotional
worthies who had once moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to emotion were no longer able to
assert their presence there.

<p/>However, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was; and in fulfilment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) intention he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went on
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) former lodging in <div class="bookquote">``Beersheba,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>near the ritualistic church of
St. Silas. The old landlady who opened the door seemed glad to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) again, and bringing some lunch informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) that the builder who
had employed him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) had called to inquire his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) address.

<p/>Jude went on to the stone-yard where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had worked. But the old
sheds and bankers were distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt it impossible to
engage himself to return and stay in this place of vanished dreams.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) longed for the hour of the homeward train to Alfredston, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
might probably meet Sue.

<p/>Then, for one ghastly half-hour of depression caused by these scenes,
there returned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) that feeling which had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) undoing more
than once--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was not worth the trouble of being taken care of
either by himself or others; and during this half-hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) met Tinker
Taylor, the bankrupt ecclesiastical ironmonger, at Fourways, who
proposed that they should adjourn to a bar and drink together.
They walked along the street till they stood before one of the
great palpitating centres of Christminster life, the inn wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
formerly had responded to the challenge to rehearse the Creed in
Latin--now a popular tavern with a spacious and inviting entrance,
which gave admittance to a bar that had been entirely renovated and
refitted in modern style since Jude's residence here.

<p/>Tinker Taylor drank off his (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) glass and departed, saying it was too
stylish a place now for him (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) to feel at home in unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was drunker
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had money to be just then. Jude was longer finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
and stood abstractedly silent in the, for the minute, almost empty
place. The bar had been gutted and newly arranged throughout,
mahogany fixtures having taken the place of the old painted
ones, while at the back of the standing-space there were stuffed
sofa-benches. The room was divided into compartments in the approved
manner, between which were screens of ground glass in mahogany
framing, to prevent topers in one compartment being put to the blush
by the recognitions of those in the next. On the inside of the
counter two barmaids leant over the white-handled beer-engines,
and the row of little silvered taps inside, dripping into a pewter
trough.

<p/>Feeling tired, and having nothing more to do till the train left,
Jude sat down on one of the sofas. At the back of the barmaids rose
bevel-edged mirrors, with glass shelves running along their front,
on which stood precious liquids that Jude did not know the name
of, in bottles of topaz, sapphire, ruby and amethyst. The moment
was enlivened by the entrance of some customers into the next
compartment, and the starting of the mechanical tell-tale of monies
received, which emitted a ting-ting every time a coin was put in.

<p/>The barmaid attending to this compartment was invisible to Jude's
direct glance, though a reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) back in the glass behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) was occasionally caught by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had only observed this
listlessly, when she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) face for a moment to the glass to set
her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) hair tidy. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was amazed to discover that the face was
Arabella's.

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) had come on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) compartment she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) would have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>).
But she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) did not, this being presided over by the maiden on the other
side. Abby was in a black gown, with white linen cuffs and a broad
white collar, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) figure, more developed than formerly, was
accentuated by a bunch of daffodils that she (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) wore on her (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) left bosom.
In the compartment she (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) served stood an electro-plated fountain of
water over a spirit-lamp, whose blue flame sent a steam from the top,
all this being visible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) only in the mirror behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>); which
also reflected the faces of the men she (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) was attending to--one of them
a handsome, dissipated young fellow, possibly an undergraduate, who
had been relating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) an experience of some humorous sort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Cockman, now! How can you tell such a tale to me in my
innocence!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) cried gaily. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cockman, what do you use to make
your moustache curl so beautiful?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>As the young man was clean shaven,
the retort provoked a laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'll have a curaçao; and a light, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) served the liqueur from one of the lovely bottles and striking
a match held it to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cigarette with ministering archness while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
whiffed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a sound,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in Australia; and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s there still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude's eyes grew rounder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What made you part from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you ask questions, and you won't hear lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come then, give me my change, which you've been keeping from me for
the last quarter of an hour; and I'll romantically vanish up the
street of this picturesque city.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) handed the change over the counter, in taking which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>)
fingers and held them. There was a slight struggle and titter, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) good-bye and left.

<p/>Jude had looked on with the eye of a dazed philosopher. It was
extraordinary how far removed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) life Arabella now seemed to
be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not realize their nominal closeness. And, this being
the case, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) present frame of mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was indifferent to the fact
that Arabella was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) wife indeed.

<p/>The compartment that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) served emptied itself of visitors, and
after a brief thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) entered it, and went forward to the counter.
Arabella did not recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) for a moment. Then their glances met.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) started; till a humorous impudence sparkled in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm blest! I thought you were underground years ago!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard anything of you, or I don't know that I should
have come here. But never mind! What shall I treat you to this
afternoon? A Scotch and soda? Come, anything that the house will
afford, for old acquaintance' sake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, Arabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude without a smile. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't want
anything more than I've had.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The fact was that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) unexpected
presence there had destroyed at a stroke his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) momentary taste for
strong liquor as completely as if it had whisked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
milk-fed infancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a pity, now you could get it for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long have you been here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About six weeks. I returned from Sydney three months ago. I always
liked this business, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you came to this place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as I say, I thought you were gone to glory, and being in
London I saw the situation in an advertisement. Nobody was likely to
know me here, even if I had minded, for I was never in Christminster
in my growing up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you return from Australia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I had my reasons... Then you are not a don yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even a reverend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor so much as a rather reverend dissenting gentleman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am as I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True--you look so.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) idly allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fingers to rest on the
pull of the beer-engine as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) critically. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) observed
that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands were smaller and whiter than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had lived with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and that on the hand which pulled the engine she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wore an
ornamental ring set with what seemed to be real sapphires--which they
were, indeed, and were much admired as such by the young men who
frequented the bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you pass as having a living husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I thought it might be awkward if I called myself a widow, as I
should have liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True. I am known here a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean on that account--for as I said I didn't expect you.
It was for other reasons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care to go into them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) replied evasively. <div class="bookquote">``I make a
very good living, and I don't know that I want your company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a chappie moustache</b></font>)</div><p/>Here a chappie with no chin, and a moustache like a lady's eyebrow,
came and asked for a curiously compounded drink, and Arabella was
obliged to go and attend to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We can't talk here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said,
stepping back a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you wait till nine? Say yes, and
don't be a fool. I can get off duty two hours sooner than usual, if
I ask. I am not living in the house at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) reflected and said gloomily, <div class="bookquote">``I'll come back. I suppose we'd
better arrange something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother arranging! I'm not going to arrange anything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must know a thing or two; and, as you say, we can't talk here.
Very well; I'll call for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Depositing his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) unemptied glass he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) went out and walked up and down the
street. Here was a rude flounce into the pellucid sentimentality of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) sad attachment to Sue. Though Arabella's word was absolutely
untrustworthy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) thought there might be some truth in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
implication that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not wished to disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), and had really
supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) dead. However, there was only one thing now to be done,
and that was to play a straightforward part, the law being the law,
and the woman between whom and himself there was no more unity than
between east and west, being in the eye of the Church one person with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>).

<p/>Having to meet Arabella here, it was impossible to meet Sue at
Alfredston as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had promised. At every thought of this a pang
had gone through him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>); but the conjuncture could not be helped.
Arabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
unauthorized love. Passing the evening, therefore, in a desultory
waiting about the town wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) avoided the precincts of every
cloister and hall, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) could not bear to behold them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
repaired to the tavern bar while the hundred and one strokes were
resounding from the Great Bell of Cardinal College, a coincidence
which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) gratuitous irony. The inn was now brilliantly
lighted up, and the scene was altogether more brisk and gay. The
faces of the barmaidens had risen in colour, each having a pink
flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) cheek; their manners were still more vivacious than
before--more abandoned, more excited, more sensuous, and they
expressed their sentiments and desires less euphemistically, laughing
in a lackadaisical tone, without reserve.

<p/>The bar had been crowded with men of all sorts during the previous
hour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) had heard from without the hubbub of their voices; but
the customers were fewer at last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) nodded to Arabella, and told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) would find him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) outside the door when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) came away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must have something with me first,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) said with great
good humour. <div class="bookquote">``Just an early night-cap: I always do. Then you can
go out and wait a minute, as it is best we should not be seen going
together.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) drew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy; and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) had evidently, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) countenance, already taken in
enough alcohol either by drinking or, more probably, from the
atmosphere she (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) had breathed for so many hours, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) finished hers
quickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) also drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), and went outside the house.

<p/>In a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) came, in a thick jacket and a hat with a black
feather. <div class="bookquote">``I live quite near,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cardinal</b></font>) said, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``and can let
myself in by a latch-key at any time. What arrangement do you want
to come to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--none in particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) answered, thoroughly sick and tired, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
thoughts again reverting to Alfredston, and the train he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) did not go
by; the probable disappointment of Sue that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) was not there when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) arrived, and the missed pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) company on the long and
lonely climb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to
have gone back really! My aunt is on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) deathbed, I fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go over with you to-morrow morning. I think I could get a day
off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of Arabella,
who had no more sympathy than a tigress with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) relations or him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>),
coming to the bedside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) dying aunt, and meeting Sue. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``Of course, if you'd like to, you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that we'll consider... Now, until we have come to some
agreement it is awkward our being together here--where you are known,
and I am getting known, though without any suspicion that I have
anything to do with you. As we are going towards the station,
suppose we take the nine-forty train to Aldbrickham? We shall be
there in little more than half an hour, and nobody will know us for
one night, and we shall be quite free to act as we choose till we
have made up our minds whether we'll make anything public or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then wait till I get two or three things. This is my lodging.
Sometimes when late I sleep at the hotel where I am engaged, so
nobody will think anything of my staying out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) speedily returned, and they went on to the railway, and made the
half-hour's journey to Aldbrickham, where they entered a third-rate
inn near the station in time for a late supper.



<p/>IX


<p/>On the morrow between nine and half-past they were journeying back
to Christminster, the only two occupants of a compartment in a
third-class railway-carriage. Having, like Jude, made rather a
hasty toilet to catch the train, Arabella looked a little frowsy,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face was very far from possessing the animation which had
characterized it at the bar the night before. When they came out of
the station she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) still had half an hour to spare before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was due at the bar. They walked in silence a little way out of
the town in the direction of Alfredston. Jude looked up the far
highway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ... poor feeble me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the very road by which I came into Christminster years ago
full of plans!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, whatever the road is I think my time is nearly up, as I have
to be in the bar by eleven o'clock. And as I said, I shan't ask for
the day to go with you to see your aunt. So perhaps we had better
part here. I'd sooner not walk up Chief Street with you, since we've
come to no conclusion at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. But you said when we were getting up this morning that
you had something you wished to tell me before I left?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I had--two things--one in particular. But you wouldn't promise
to keep it a secret. I'll tell you now if you promise? As an honest
woman I wish you to know it... It was what I began telling you
in the night--about that gentleman who managed the Sydney hotel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>Arabella spoke somewhat hurriedly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You'll keep it close?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes--I promise!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't
want to reveal your secrets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever I met him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) out for a walk, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) used to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was much
taken with my looks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) kept pressing me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). I never
thought of coming back to England again; and being out there in
Australia, with no home of my own after leaving my father, I at last
agreed, and did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Regularly--legally--in church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) till shortly before I left. It was stupid,
I know; but I did! There, now I've told you. Don't round upon me!
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) talks of coming back to England, poor old chap. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does,
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't be likely to find me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude stood pale and fixed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why the devil didn't you tell me last, night!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I didn't... Won't you make it up with me, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So in talking of `your husband' to the bar gentlemen you meant him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
of course--not me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course... Come, don't fuss about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing more to say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>replied Jude. <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing at all
to say about the--crime--you've confessed to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Crime! Pooh. They don't think much of such as that over there!
Lots of 'em do it... Well, if you take it like that I shall go back
to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was very fond of me, and we lived honourable enough, and
as respectable as any married couple in the colony! How did I know
where you were?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't go blaming you. I could say a good deal; but perhaps it
would be misplaced. What do you wish me to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. There was one thing more I wanted to tell you; but I fancy
we've seen enough of one another for the present! I shall think over
what you said about your circumstances, and let you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus they parted. Jude watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) disappear in the direction of
the hotel, and entered the railway station close by. Finding that
it wanted three-quarters of an hour of the time at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could
get a train back to Alfredston, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) strolled mechanically into the
city as far as to the Fourways, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stood as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had so often
stood before, and surveyed Chief Street stretching ahead, with its
college after college, in picturesqueness unrivalled except by such
Continental vistas as the Street of Palaces in Genoa; the lines
of the buildings being as distinct in the morning air as in an
architectural drawing. But Jude was far from seeing or criticizing
these things; they were hidden by an indescribable consciousness of
Arabella's midnight contiguity, a sense of degradation at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) revived
experiences with her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), of her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) appearance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) lay asleep at dawn,
which set upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) motionless face a look as of one accurst. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
could only have felt resentment towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) would have been less
unhappy; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) pitied while he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) contemned her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>).

<p/>Jude turned and retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) steps. Drawing again towards the
station he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) started at hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) name pronounced--less at the name
than at the voice. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) great surprise no other than Sue stood
like a vision before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)--her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) look bodeful and anxious as in a dream,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) little mouth nervous, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) strained eyes speaking reproachful
inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jude--I am so glad--to meet you like this!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said in quick,
uneven accents not far from a sob. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) flushed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) observed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought that they had not met since her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) marriage.

<p/>They looked away from each other to hide their emotion, took each
other's hand without further speech, and went on together awhile,
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with furtive solicitude. <div class="bookquote">``I arrived at
Alfredston station last night, as you asked me to, and there was
nobody to meet me! But I reached Marygreen alone, and they told me
Aunt was a trifle better. I sat up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), and as you did not come
all night I was frightened about you--I thought that perhaps, when
you found yourself back in the old city, you were upset at--at
thinking I was--married, and not there as I used to be; and that you
had nobody to speak to; so you had tried to drown your gloom--as you
did at that former time when you were disappointed about entering as
a student, and had forgotten your promise to me that you never would
again. And this, I thought, was why you hadn't come to meet me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you came to hunt me up, and deliver me, like a good angel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I would come by the morning train and try to find you--in
case--in case--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did think of my promise to you, dear, continually! I shall never
break out again as I did, I am sure. I may have been doing nothing
better, but I was not doing that--I loathe the thought of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad your staying had nothing to do with that. But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said,
the faintest pout entering into her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) tone, <div class="bookquote">``you didn't come back last
night and meet me, as you engaged to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't--I am sorry to say. I had an appointment at nine
o'clock--too late for me to catch the train that would have met
yours, or to get home at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) loved one as she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tender
thought the sweetest and most disinterested comrade that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had ever
had, living largely in vivid imaginings, so ethereal a creature
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) spirit could be seen trembling through her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) limbs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt
heartily ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) earthliness in spending the hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
spent in Arabella's company. There was something rude and immoral
in thrusting these recent facts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) life upon the mind of one who,
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), was so uncarnate as to seem at times impossible as a human
wife to any average man. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was Phillotson's. How she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
become such, how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lived as such, passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) comprehension as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to-day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll go back with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There's a train just now. I
wonder how my aunt is by this time... And so, Sue, you really came
on my account all this way! At what an early time you must have
started, poor thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Sitting up watching alone made me all nerves for you, and
instead of going to bed when it got light I started. And now you
won't frighten me like this again about your morals for nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was not so sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been frightened about his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) morals for
nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) released her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand till they had entered the train,--it
seemed the same carriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had lately got out of with another--where
they sat down side by side, Sue between him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) and the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
regarded the delicate lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) profile, and the small, tight,
applelike convexities of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bodice, so different from Arabella's
amplitudes. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not turn
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), but kept her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes forward, as if afraid that by meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
own some troublous discussion would be initiated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue--you are married now, you know, like me; and yet we have been in
such a hurry that we have not said a word about it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no necessity,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) quickly returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well--perhaps not... But I wish''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jude--don't talk about ME--I wish you wouldn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) entreated.
<div class="bookquote">``It distresses me, rather. Forgive my saying it! ... Where did you
stay last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had asked the question in perfect innocence, to change the topic.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) knew that, and said merely, <div class="bookquote">``At an inn,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>though it would have been
a relief to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) meeting with an unexpected one. But the
latter's final announcement of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marriage in Australia bewildered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) lest what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) might say should do his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) ignorant wife an injury.

<p/>Their talk proceeded but awkwardly till they reached Alfredston.
That Sue was not as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had been, but was labelled <div class="bookquote">``Phillotson,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>paralyzed Jude whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wanted to commune with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) as an
individual. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) seemed unaltered--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not say why.
There remained the five-mile extra journey into the country, which
it was just as easy to walk as to drive, the greater part of it being
uphill. Jude had never before in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) life gone that road with Sue,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had with another. It was now as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) carried a bright
light which temporarily banished the shady associations of the
earlier time.

<p/>Sue talked; but Jude noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) still kept the conversation
from herself. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) inquired if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) husband were well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) is obliged to be in the school all the day,
or he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) would have come with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) is so good and kind that to
accompany me he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) would have dismissed the school for once, even
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) principles--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) is strongly opposed to giving casual
holidays--only I wouldn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). I felt it would be better to come
alone. Aunt Drusilla, I knew, was so very eccentric; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) being
almost a stranger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Drusilla</b></font>) now would have made it irksome to both.
Since it turns out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Drusilla</b></font>) is hardly conscious I am glad I did not
ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude had walked moodily while this praise of Phillotson was being
expressed. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Phillotson obliges you in everything, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) ought,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to be a happy wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And of course I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bride, I might almost have said, as yet. It is not so many weeks
since I gave you to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know! I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>There was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face which belied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) late assuring words, so strictly proper and so lifelessly spoken
that they might have been taken from a list of model speeches in <div class="bookquote">``The
Wife's Guide to Conduct.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Jude knew the quality of every vibration
in Sue's voice, could read every symptom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) mental condition; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was unhappy, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had not been a
month married. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) rushing away thus from home, to see the last
of a relative whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had hardly known in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) life, proved nothing;
for Sue naturally did such things as those.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you have my good wishes now as always, Mrs. Phillotson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) by a glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you are not Mrs. Phillotson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>murmured Jude. <div class="bookquote">``You are dear,
free Sue Bridehead, only you don't know it! Wifedom has not yet
squashed up and digested you in its vast maw as an atom which has no
further individuality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue put on a look of being offended, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Nor has
husbandom you, so far as I can see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it has!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head sadly.

<p/>When they reached the lone cottage under the firs, between the
Brown House and Marygreen, in which Jude and Arabella had lived and
quarrelled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned to look at it. A squalid family lived there
now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not help saying to Sue: <div class="bookquote">``That's the house my wife and
I occupied the whole of the time we lived together. I brought her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
home to that house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked at it. <div class="bookquote">``That to you was what the school-house at Shaston
is to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I was not very happy there as you are in yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lips in retortive silence, and they walked some way
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was taking it. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I
may have exaggerated your happiness--one never knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) continued
blandly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think that, Jude, for a moment, even though you may have said
it to sting me! He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)'s as good to me as a man can be, and gives me
perfect liberty--which elderly husbands don't do in general... If
you think I am not happy because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s too old for me, you are wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think anything against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--to you dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you won't say things to distress me, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said no more, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew that, from some cause or other, in
taking Phillotson as a husband, Sue felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had done what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
ought not to have done.

<p/>They plunged into the concave field on the other side of which rose
the village--the field wherein Jude had received a thrashing from
the farmer many years earlier. On ascending to the village and
approaching the house they found Mrs. Edlin standing at the door, who
at sight of them lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) hands deprecatingly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s downstairs,
if you'll believe me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>cried the widow. <div class="bookquote">``Out o' bed she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got, and
nothing could turn her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What will come o't I do not know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>On entering, there indeed by the fireplace sat the old woman, wrapped
in blankets, and turning upon them a countenance like that of
Sebastiano's Lazarus. They must have looked their amazement, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said in a hollow voice:

<p/>``Ah--sceered ye, have I! I wasn't going to bide up there no longer,
to please nobody! ``Tis more than flesh and blood can bear, to be
ordered to do this and that by a feller that don't know half as well
as you do yourself! ... Ah--you'll rue this marrying as well as
he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>)!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, turning to Sue. <div class="bookquote">``All our family do--and nearly all
everybody else's. You should have done as I did, you simpleton! And
Phillotson the schoolmaster, of all men! What made `ee marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes most women marry, Aunt?''

better than I--but that's what I SHOULD have said!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue jumped up and went out. Jude followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the
outhouse, crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude in distress. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) means well, but is
very crusty and queer now, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--it isn't that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue, trying to dry her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
mind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) roughness one bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is that what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says is--is true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God--what--you don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>asked Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said hastily. <div class="bookquote">``That I ought--perhaps I
ought not to have married!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had really been going to say that at first.
They went back, and the subject was smoothed over, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) aunt took
rather kindly to Sue, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) that not many young women newly
married would have come so far to see a sick old crone like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).
In the afternoon Sue prepared to depart, Jude hiring a neighbour to
drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to Alfredston.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go with you to the station, if you'd like?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). The man came round with the trap, and Jude
helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) into it, perhaps with unnecessary attention, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) prohibitively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose--I may come to see you some day, when I am back again at
Melchester?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) half-crossly observed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bent down and said softly: <div class="bookquote">``No, dear--you are not to come yet.
I don't think you are in a good mood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand and was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s right! I won't go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) passed the evening and following days in mortifying by every
possible means his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), nearly starving himself in
attempts to extinguish by fasting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) passionate tendency to love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) read sermons on discipline, and hunted up passages in Church
history that treated of the Ascetics of the second century. Before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had returned from Marygreen to Melchester there arrived a letter
from Arabella. The sight of it revived a stronger feeling of
self-condemnation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) brief return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) society than for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
attachment to Sue.

<p/>The letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) perceived, bore a London postmark instead of the
Christminster one. Arabella informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) that a few days after their
parting in the morning at Christminster, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had been surprised by an
affectionate letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) Australian husband, formerly manager of
the hotel in Sydney. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) had come to England on purpose to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>);
and had taken a free, fully-licensed public, in Lambeth, where he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>)
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to join him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) in conducting the business, which was likely
to be a very thriving one, the house being situated in an excellent,
densely populated, gin-drinking neighbourhood, and already doing a
trade of #200 a month, which could be easily doubled.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) very much still, and implored her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was, and as they had only parted in a slight tiff,
and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) engagement in Christminster was only temporary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
just gone to join him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) urged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could not help feeling that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) more than to Jude, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had properly married
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and had lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) much longer than with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) first husband.
In thus wishing Jude good-bye she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) no ill-will, and trusted
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would not turn upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), a weak woman, and inform against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>),
and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to ruin now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had a chance of improving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
circumstances and leading a genteel life.



<p/>X


<p/>Jude returned to Melchester, which had the questionable
recommendation of being only a dozen and a half miles from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) Sue's
now permanent residence. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt that this nearness was a
distinct reason for not going southward at all; but Christminster
was too sad a place to bear, while the proximity of Shaston to
Melchester might afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) the glory of worsting the Enemy in a
close engagement, such as was deliberately sought by the priests and
virgins of the early Church, who, disdaining an ignominious flight
from temptation, became even chamber-partners with impunity.
Jude did not pause to remember that, in the laconic words of the
historian, <div class="bookquote">``insulted Nature sometimes vindicated her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rights''  (<font color='red'><b>the historian</b></font>)</div>in such
circumstances.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now returned with feverish desperation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) study for the
priesthood--in the recognition that the single-mindedness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
aims, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fidelity to the cause, had been more than questionable
of late. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) passion for Sue troubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) soul; yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lawful
abandonment to the society of Arabella for twelve hours seemed
instinctively a worse thing--even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
Sydney husband till afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) verily believed, overcome
all tendency to fly to liquor--which, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never done from
taste, but merely as an escape from intolerable misery of mind. Yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) perceived with despondency that, taken all round, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a man of
too many passions to make a good clergyman; the utmost he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could hope
for was that in a life of constant internal warfare between flesh and
spirit the former might not always be victorious.

<p/>As a hobby, auxiliary to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) readings in Divinity, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) developed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
slight skill in church-music and thorough-bass, till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could join in
part-singing from notation with some accuracy. A mile or two from
Melchester there was a restored village church, to which Jude had
originally gone to fix the new columns and capitals. By this means
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had become acquainted with the organist, and the ultimate result
was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) joined the choir as a bass voice.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walked out to this parish twice every Sunday, and sometimes in the
week. One evening about Easter the choir met for practice, and a new
hymn which Jude had heard of as being by a Wessex composer was to be
tried and prepared for the following week. It turned out to be a
strangely emotional composition. As they all sang it over and over
again its harmonies grew upon Jude, and moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) exceedingly.

<p/>When they had finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went round to the organist to make
inquiries. The score was in manuscript, the name of the composer
being at the head, together with the title of the hymn: <div class="bookquote">``The Foot
of the Cross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the composer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the organist</b></font>)</div>said the organist. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a local man. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a professional
musician at Kennetbridge--between here and Christminster. The
vicar knows him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) was brought up and educated in Christminster
traditions, which accounts for the quality of the piece. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)
plays in the large church there, and has a surpliced choir. He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) comes
to Melchester sometimes, and once tried to get the cathedral organ
when the post was vacant. The hymn is getting about everywhere this
Easter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>organist</b></font>) walked humming the air on his (<font color='blue'><b>organist</b></font>) way home, Jude fell to musing
on its composer, and the reasons why he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) composed it. What a man of
sympathies he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) must be! Perplexed and harassed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) himself was
about Sue and Arabella, and troubled as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) conscience by the
complication of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) position, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) would like to know that man!
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) of all men would understand my difficulties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said the impulsive
Jude. If there were any person in the world to choose as a
confidant, this composer would be the one, for he (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) must have suffered,
and throbbed, and yearned.

<p/>In brief, ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) could afford the time and money for the journey,
Fawley resolved, like the child that he (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) was, to go to Kennetbridge
the very next Sunday. He (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) duly started, early in the morning, for it
was only by a series of crooked railways that he (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) could get to the
town. About mid-day he (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) reached it, and crossing the bridge into the
quaint old borough he (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) inquired for the house of the composer.

<p/>They told him (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) it was a red brick building some little way further on.
Also that the gentleman himself had just passed along the street not
five minutes before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>asked Jude with alacrity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Straight along homeward from church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude hastened on, and soon had the pleasure of observing a man in a
black coat and a black slouched felt hat no considerable distance
ahead. Stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) legs yet more widely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stalked after.
<div class="bookquote">``A hungry soul in pursuit of a full soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I must speak
to that man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not, however, overtake the musician before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had entered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own house, and then arose the question if this were an expedient
time to call. Whether or not he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) decided to do so there and then, now
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had got here, the distance home being too great for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to
wait till late in the afternoon. This man of soul would understand
scant ceremony, and might be quite a perfect adviser in a case in
which an earthly and illegitimate passion had cunningly obtained
entrance into his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) heart through the opening afforded for religion.

<p/>Jude accordingly rang the bell, and was admitted.

<p/>The musician came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in a moment, and being respectably dressed,
good-looking, and frank in manner, Jude obtained a favourable
reception. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was nevertheless conscious that there would be a
certain awkwardness in explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) errand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been singing in the choir of a little church near
Melchester,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. ``And we have this week practised ``The Foot
of the Cross,<div class="bookquote">'' which I understand, sir, that you composed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did--a year or so ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--like it. I think it supremely beautiful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah well--other people have said so too. Yes, there's money in
it, if I could only see about getting it published. I have other
compositions to go with it, too; I wish I could bring them out; for
I haven't made a five-pound note out of any of them yet. These
publishing people--they want the copyright of an obscure composer's
work, such as mine is, for almost less than I should have to pay a
person for making a fair manuscript copy of the score. The one you
speak of I have lent to various friends about here and Melchester,
and so it has got to be sung a little. But music is a poor staff to
lean on--I am giving it up entirely. You must go into trade if you
want to make money nowadays. The wine business is what I am thinking
of. This is my forthcoming list--it is not issued yet--but you can
take one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) handed Jude an advertisement list of several pages in booklet
shape, ornamentally margined with a red line, in which were set forth
the various clarets, champagnes, ports, sherries, and other wines
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) purposed to initiate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) new venture. It took Jude
more than by surprise that the man with the soul was thus and thus;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not open up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confidences.

<p/>They talked a little longer, but constrainedly, for when the musician
found that Jude was a poor man his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) manner changed from what it had
been while Jude's appearance and address deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
position and pursuits. Jude stammered out something about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
feelings in wishing to congratulate the author on such an exalted
composition, and took an embarrassed leave.

<p/>All the way home by the slow Sunday train, sitting in the fireless
waiting-rooms on this cold spring day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was depressed enough at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) simplicity in taking such a journey. But no sooner did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reach
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) Melchester lodging than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) a letter which had
arrived that morning a few minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had left the house. It
was a contrite little note from Sue, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, with sweet
humility, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had been horrid in telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
was not to come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) despised herself for having
been so conventional; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was to be sure to come by the
eleven-forty-five train that very Sunday, and have dinner with them
at half-past one.

<p/>Jude almost tore his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hair at having missed this letter till it was
too late to act upon its contents; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had chastened himself
considerably of late, and at last his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) chimerical expedition
to Kennetbridge really did seem to have been another special
intervention of Providence to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) away from temptation. But a
growing impatience of faith, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had noticed in himself more
than once of late, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pass over in ridicule the idea that God
sent people on fools' errands. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) longed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was angry
at having missed her (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>): and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wrote instantly, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>) what had
happened, and saying he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not enough patience to wait till the
following Sunday, but would come any day in the week that she (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>) liked
to name.

<p/>Since he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wrote a little over-ardently, Sue, as her (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>) manner was,
delayed her (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>) reply till Thursday before Good Friday, when she (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
might come that afternoon if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wished, this being the earliest day
on which she (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>) could welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>) was now assistant-teacher in
her (<font color='blue'><b>fools</b></font>) husband's school. Jude therefore got leave from the cathedral
works at the trifling expense of a stoppage of pay, and went.





<p/>Part Fourth


<p/>AT SHASTON



<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whoso prefers either Matrimony or other Ordinance before
the Good of Man and the plain Exigence of Charity, let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) profess Papist, or Protestant, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) will, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>)
is no better than a Pharisee.'' (<font color='red'><b>J.</b></font>)</div>--J. MILTON.


<p/>I


<p/>Shaston, the ancient British Palladour,

<p/>From whose foundation first such strange reports
arise,


<p/>-LRB-as Drayton sang it-RRB-, was, and is, in itself the city of a dream.
Vague imaginings of its castle, its three mints, its magnificent
apsidal abbey, the chief glory of South Wessex, its twelve churches,
its shrines, chantries, hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions--all
now ruthlessly swept away--throw the visitor, even against his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) will,
into a pensive melancholy, which the stimulating atmosphere and
limitless landscape around him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) can scarcely dispel. The spot was the
burial-place of a king and a queen, of abbots and abbesses, saints
and bishops, knights and squires. The bones of King Edward <div class="bookquote">``the
Martyr,''  (<font color='red'><b>King Edward</b></font>)</div>carefully removed hither for holy preservation, brought
Shaston a renown which made it the resort of pilgrims from every part
of Europe, and enabled it to maintain a reputation extending far
beyond English shores. To this fair creation of the great Middle-Age
the Dissolution was, as historians tell us, the death-knell. With
the destruction of the enormous abbey the whole place collapsed in a
general ruin: the Martyr's bones met with the fate of the sacred pile
that held them, and not a stone is now left to tell where they lie.

<p/>The natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town still remain;
but strange to say these qualities, which were noted by many writers
in ages when scenic beauty is said to have been unappreciated, are
passed over in this, and one of the queerest and quaintest spots in
England stands virtually unvisited to-day.

<p/>It has a unique position on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp,
rising on the north, south, and west sides of the borough out of
the deep alluvial Vale of Blackmoor, the view from the Castle Green
over three counties of verdant pasture--South, Mid, and Nether
Wessex--being as sudden a surprise to the unexpectant traveller's
eyes as the medicinal air is to his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) lungs. Impossible to a railway,
it can best be reached on foot, next best by light vehicles; and
it is hardly accessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the
north-east, that connects it with the high chalk table-land on that
side.

<p/>Such is, and such was, the now world-forgotten Shaston or Palladour.
Its situation rendered water the great want of the town; and within
living memory, horses, donkeys and men may have been seen toiling
up the winding ways to the top of the height, laden with tubs and
barrels filled from the wells beneath the mountain, and hawkers
retailing their contents at the price of a halfpenny a bucketful.

<p/>This difficulty in the water supply, together with two other odd
facts, namely, that the chief graveyard slopes up as steeply as a
roof behind the church, and that in former times the town passed
through a curious period of corruption, conventual and domestic, gave
rise to the saying that Shaston was remarkable for three consolations
to man, such as the world afforded not elsewhere. It was a place
where the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple, where
beer was more plentiful than water, and where there were more wanton
women than honest wives and maids. It is also said that after the
Middle Ages the inhabitants were too poor to pay their priests,
and hence were compelled to pull down their churches, and refrain
altogether from the public worship of God; a necessity which they
bemoaned over their cups in the settles of their inns on Sunday
afternoons. In those days the Shastonians were apparently not
without a sense of humour.

<p/>There was another peculiarity--this a modern one--which Shaston
appeared to owe to its site. It was the resting-place and
headquarters of the proprietors of wandering vans, shows,
shooting-galleries, and other itinerant concerns, whose business
lay largely at fairs and markets. As strange wild birds are seen
assembled on some lofty promontory, meditatively pausing for longer
flights, or to return by the course they followed thither, so here,
in this cliff-town, stood in stultified silence the yellow and green
caravans bearing names not local, as if surprised by a change in the
landscape so violent as to hinder their further progress; and here
they usually remained all the winter till they turned to seek again
their old tracks in the following spring.

<p/>It was to this breezy and whimsical spot that Jude ascended from the
nearest station for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) life about four o'clock one
afternoon, and entering on the summit of the peak after a toilsome
climb, passed the first houses of the aerial town; and drew towards
the school-house. The hour was too early; the pupils were still in
school, humming small, like a swarm of gnats; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) withdrew a few
steps along Abbey Walk, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) regarded the spot which fate had
made the home of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) loved best in the world. In front of the
schools, which were extensive and stone-built, grew two enormous
beeches with smooth mouse-coloured trunks, as such trees will only
grow on chalk uplands. Within the mullioned and transomed windows he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
could see the black, brown, and flaxen crowns of the scholars over
the sills, and to pass the time away he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walked down to the level
terrace where the abbey gardens once had spread, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heart throbbing
in spite of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>Unwilling to enter till the children were dismissed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remained here
till young voices could be heard in the open air, and girls in white
pinafores over red and blue frocks appeared dancing along the paths
which the abbess, prioress, subprioress, and fifty nuns had demurely
paced three centuries earlier. Retracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had waited too long, and that Sue had gone out into the town at the
heels of the last scholar, Mr. Phillotson having been absent all the
afternoon at a teachers' meeting at Shottsford.

<p/>Jude went into the empty schoolroom and sat down, the girl who was
sweeping the floor having informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) that Mrs. Phillotson would be
back again in a few minutes. A piano stood near--actually the old
piano that Phillotson had possessed at Marygreen--and though the dark
afternoon almost prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) seeing the notes Jude touched them in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) humble way, and could not help modulating into the hymn which had
so affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in the previous week.

<p/>A figure moved behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and thinking it was still the girl with
the broom Jude took no notice, till the person came close and laid
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers lightly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) bass hand. The imposed hand was a
little one he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed to know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue. <div class="bookquote">``I like it. I learnt it before I left
Melchester. They used to play it in the training school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't strum before you! Play it for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well--I don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue sat down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) rendering of the piece, though not remarkable,
seemed divine as compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), like him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), was evidently
touched--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own surprise--by the recalled air; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had finished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand towards hers, it met his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own
half-way. Jude grasped it--just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had done before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, in a voice quite changed, <div class="bookquote">``that I should care
about that air; because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not that sort--quite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not easily moved?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't quite mean that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but you ARE one of that sort, for you are just like me at
heart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not at head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) played on and suddenly turned round; and by an unpremeditated
instinct each clasped the other's hand again.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) uttered a forced little laugh as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) relinquished his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``How funny!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what we both did that for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose because we are both alike, as I said before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in our thoughts! Perhaps a little in our feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they rule thoughts... Isn't it enough to make one blaspheme
that the composer of that hymn is one of the most commonplace men I
ever met!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--you know him (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I went to see him (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you goose--to do just what I should have done! Why did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because we are not alike,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we'll have some tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we have it here instead
of in my house? It is no trouble to get the kettle and things
brought in. We don't live at the school you know, but in that
ancient dwelling across the way called Old-Grove Place. It is so
antique and dismal that it depresses me dreadfully. Such houses are
very well to visit, but not to live in--I feel crushed into the earth
by the weight of so many previous lives there spent. In a new place
like these schools there is only your own life to support. Sit down,
and I'll tell Ada to bring the tea-things across.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) waited in the light of the stove, the door of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) flung open
before going out, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) returned, followed by the maiden with
tea, they sat down by the same light, assisted by the blue rays of a
spirit-lamp under the brass kettle on the stand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is one of your wedding-presents to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, signifying
the latter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/>The kettle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) gift sang with some satire in its note, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
mind; and to change the subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you know of any good
readable edition of the uncanonical books of the New Testament? You
don't read them in the school I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no!--`twould alarm the neighbourhood... Yes, there is one.
I am not familiar with it now, though I was interested in it when my
former friend was alive. Cowper's _Apocryphal Gospels_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That sounds like what I want.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thoughts, however reverted with
a twinge to the <div class="bookquote">``former friend'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) meant, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew, the
university comrade of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) earlier days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) talked of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to Phillotson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Gospel of Nicodemus is very nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went on to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) jealous thoughts, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) read clearly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) always did.
Indeed when they talked on an indifferent subject, as now, there was
ever a second silent conversation passing between their emotions,
so perfect was the reciprocity between them. <div class="bookquote">``It is quite like the
genuine article. All cut up into verses, too; so that it is like
one of the other evangelists read in a dream, when things are the
same, yet not the same. But, Jude, do you take an interest in those
questions still? Are you getting up _Apologetica_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I am reading Divinity harder than ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you look at me like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--why do you want to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you can tell me anything I may be ignorant of in that
subject. You must have learnt a lot of everything from your dear
dead friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We won't get on to that now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) coaxed. <div class="bookquote">``Will you be carving out
at that church again next week, where you learnt the pretty hymn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be very nice. Shall I come and see you there? It is in
this direction, and I could come any afternoon by train for half an
hour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Don't come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--aren't we going to be friends, then, any longer, as we used to
be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know that. I thought you were always going to be kind to
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I done, then? I am sure I thought we two--''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The
_tremolo_ in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) voice caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to break off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue, I sometimes think you are a flirt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) abruptly.

<p/>There was a momentary pause, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) suddenly jumped up; and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw by the kettle-flame that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face was flushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't talk to you any longer, Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, the tragic
contralto note having come back as of old. <div class="bookquote">``It is getting too dark
to stay together like this, after playing morbid Good Friday tunes
that make one feel what one shouldn't! ... We mustn't sit and talk
in this way any more. Yes--you must go away, for you mistake me! I
am very much the reverse of what you say so cruelly--Oh, Jude, it WAS
cruel to say that! Yet I can't tell you the truth--I should shock
you by letting you know how I give way to my impulses, and how much I
feel that I shouldn't have been provided with attractiveness unless
it were meant to be exercised! Some women's love of being loved is
insatiable; and so, often, is their love of loving; and in the last
case they may find that they can't give it continuously to the
chamber-officer appointed by the bishop's licence to receive it.
But you are so straightforward, Jude, that you can't understand
me! ... Now you must go. I am sorry my husband is not at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I perceive I have said that in mere convention! Honestly I don't
think I am sorry. It does not matter, either way, sad to say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As they had overdone the grasp of hands some time sooner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) touched
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fingers but lightly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went out now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had hardly gone
from the door when, with a dissatisfied look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) jumped on a form
and opened the iron casement of a window beneath which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was passing
in the path without. <div class="bookquote">``When do you leave here to catch your train,
Jude?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked up in some surprise. <div class="bookquote">``The coach that runs to meet it goes
in three-quarters of an hour or so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you do with yourself for the time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--wander about, I suppose. Perhaps I shall go and sit in the old
church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does seem hard of me to pack you off so! You have thought enough
of churches, Heaven knows, without going into one in the dark. Stay
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where you are. I can talk to you better like this than when you
were inside... It was so kind and tender of you to give up half
a day's work to come to see me! ... You are Joseph the dreamer of
dreams, dear Jude. And a tragic Don Quixote. And sometimes you
are St. Stephen, who, while they were stoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), could see Heaven
opened. Oh, my poor friend and comrade, you'll suffer yet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Now that the high window-sill was between them, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not
get at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) seemed not to mind indulging in a frankness she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
feared at close quarters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) continued, still in the tone of one
brimful of feeling, <div class="bookquote">``that the social moulds civilization fits us into
have no more relation to our actual shapes than the conventional
shapes of the constellations have to the real star-patterns. I
am called Mrs. Richard Phillotson, living a calm wedded life with
my counterpart of that name. But I am not really Mrs. Richard
Phillotson, but a woman tossed about, all alone, with aberrant
passions, and unaccountable antipathies... Now you mustn't wait
longer, or you will lose the coach. Come and see me again. You
must come to the house then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``When shall it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow week. Good-bye--good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand
and stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) forehead pitifully--just once. Jude said good-bye,
and went away into the darkness.

<p/>Passing along Bimport Street he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heard the wheels of the
coach departing, and, truly enough, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reached the Duke's Arms
in the Market Place the coach had gone. It was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
to get to the station on foot in time for this train, and he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) settled
himself perforce to wait for the next--the last to Melchester that
night.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) wandered about awhile, obtained something to eat; and then, having
another half-hour on his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hands, his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) feet involuntarily took him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
through the venerable graveyard of Trinity Church, with its avenues
of limes, in the direction of the schools again. They were entirely
in darkness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) lived over the way at Old-Grove
Place, a house which he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) soon discovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) description of its
antiquity.

<p/>A glimmering candlelight shone from a front window, the shutters
being yet unclosed. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) could see the interior clearly--the floor
sinking a couple of steps below the road without, which had become
raised during the centuries since the house was built. Sue,
evidently just come in, was standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) hat on in this front
parlour or sitting-room, whose walls were lined with wainscoting
of panelled oak reaching from floor to ceiling, the latter being
crossed by huge moulded beams only a little way above her (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) head. The
mantelpiece was of the same heavy description, carved with Jacobean
pilasters and scroll-work. The centuries did, indeed, ponderously
overhang a young wife who passed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) time here.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had opened a rosewood work-box, and was looking at a photograph.
Having contemplated it a little while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pressed it against her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
bosom, and put it again in its place.

<p/>Then becoming aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not obscured the windows she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came
forward to do so, candle in hand. It was too dark for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to see
Jude without, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face distinctly, and there was an
unmistakable tearfulness about the dark, long-lashed eyes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) closed the shutters, and Jude turned away to pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) solitary
journey home. <div class="bookquote">``Whose photograph was she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) looking at?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had once given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew. Yet it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
surely?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) should go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) invitation.
Those earnest men he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) read of, the saints, whom Sue, with gentle
irreverence, called his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) demi-gods, would have shunned such encounters
if they doubted their own strength. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might fast
and pray during the whole interval, but the human was more powerful
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) than the Divine.



<p/>II


<p/>However, if God disposed not, woman did. The next morning but one
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) this note from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>):


<p/>Don't come next week. On your own account don't! We were
too free, under the influence of that morbid hymn and the
twilight. Think no more than you can help of

<p/>SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY.


<p/>The disappointment was keen. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>MARY</b></font>) mood, the look of her (<font color='blue'><b>MARY</b></font>) face,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>MARY</b></font>) subscribed herself at length thus. But, whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>MARY</b></font>) mood, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
could not say she (<font color='blue'><b>MARY</b></font>) was wrong in her (<font color='blue'><b>MARY</b></font>) view. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) replied:


<p/>I acquiesce. You are right. It is a lesson in
renunciation which I suppose I ought to learn at this
season.

<p/>JUDE.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>JUDE</b></font>) despatched the note on Easter Eve, and there seemed a finality
in their decisions. But other forces and laws than theirs were in
operation. On Easter Monday morning he (<font color='blue'><b>JUDE</b></font>) received a message from the
Widow Edlin, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>JUDE</b></font>) had directed to telegraph if anything serious
happened:


<p/>Your aunt is sinking. Come at once.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>JUDE</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>JUDE</b></font>) tools and went. Three and a half hours later he (<font color='blue'><b>JUDE</b></font>)
was crossing the downs about Marygreen, and presently plunged into
the concave field across which the short cut was made to the village.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>JUDE</b></font>) ascended on the other side a labouring man, who had been
watching his (<font color='blue'><b>JUDE</b></font>) approach from a gate across the path, moved uneasily,
and prepared to speak. <div class="bookquote">``I can see in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) is dead,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Aunt Drusilla!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had supposed, and Mrs. Edlin had sent out the man to
break the news to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) wouldn't have knowed `ee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) lay like a doll wi' glass eyes;
so it didn't matter that you wasn't here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>Jude went on to the house, and in the afternoon, when everything was
done, and the layers-out had finished their beer, and gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sat
down alone in the silent place. It was absolutely necessary to
communicate with Sue, though two or three days earlier they had
agreed to mutual severance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wrote in the briefest terms:


<p/>Aunt Drusilla is dead, having been taken almost suddenly.
The funeral is on Friday afternoon.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remained in and about Marygreen through the intervening days,
went out on Friday morning to see that the grave was finished, and
wondered if Sue would come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had not written, and that seemed to
signify rather that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would come than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would not. Having
timed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) only possible train, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) locked the door about
mid-day, and crossed the hollow field to the verge of the upland by
the Brown House, where he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) stood and looked over the vast prospect
northwards, and over the nearer landscape in which Alfredston stood.
Two miles behind it a jet of white steam was travelling from the left
to the right of the picture.

<p/>There was a long time to wait, even now, till he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) would know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had arrived. He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) did wait, however, and at last a small hired vehicle
pulled up at the bottom of the hill, and a person alighted, the
conveyance going back, while the passenger began ascending the
hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked so slender to-day that it seemed
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) might be crushed in the intensity of a too passionate
embrace--such as it was not for him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) to give. Two-thirds of the way
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head suddenly took a solicitous poise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had at that moment recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face soon began a pensive
smile, which lasted till, having descended a little way, he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) began with nervous quickness, <div class="bookquote">``that it would be
so sad to let you attend the funeral alone! And so--at the last
moment--I came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear faithful Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>murmured Jude.

<p/>With the elusiveness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) curious double nature, however, Sue did
not stand still for any further greeting, though it wanted some
time to the burial. A pathos so unusually compounded as that which
attached to this hour was unlikely to repeat itself for years, if
ever, and Jude would have paused, and meditated, and conversed. But
Sue either saw it not at all, or, seeing it more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), would not
allow herself to feel it.

<p/>The sad and simple ceremony was soon over, their progress to the
church being almost at a trot, the bustling undertaker having a more
important funeral an hour later, three miles off. Drusilla was put
into the new ground, quite away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Drusilla</b></font>) ancestors. Sue and Jude
had gone side by side to the grave, and now sat down to tea in the
familiar house; their lives united at least in this last attention
to the dead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was opposed to marriage, from first to last, you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>murmured
Sue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Particularly for members of our family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and remained on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) awhile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are rather a sad family, don't you think, Jude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said we made bad husbands and wives. Certainly we make unhappy
ones. At all events, I do, for one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue was silent. <div class="bookquote">``Is it wrong, Jude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said with a tentative
tremor, <div class="bookquote">``for a husband or wife to tell a third person that they are
unhappy in their marriage? If a marriage ceremony is a religious
thing, it is possibly wrong; but if it is only a sordid contract,
based on material convenience in householding, rating, and taxing,
and the inheritance of land and money by children, making it
necessary that the male parent should be known--which it seems to
be--why surely a person may say, even proclaim upon the housetops,
that it hurts and grieves him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said so, anyhow, to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``Are there many couples, do you think, where
one dislikes the other for no definite fault?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose. If either cares for another person, for instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But even apart from that? Wouldn't the woman, for example, be very
bad-natured if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't like to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband; merely'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
voice undulated, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) guessed things--<div class="bookquote">``merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a
personal feeling against it--a physical objection--a fastidiousness,
or whatever it may be called--although she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might respect and be
grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? I am merely putting a case. Ought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to try to
overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pruderies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude threw a troubled look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, looking away: <div class="bookquote">``It would
be just one of those cases in which my experiences go contrary to my
dogmas. Speaking as an order-loving man--which I hope I am, though
I fear I am not--I should say, yes. Speaking from experience and
unbiased nature, I should say, no... Sue, I believe you are not
happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) contradicted. <div class="bookquote">``How can a woman be unhappy who
has only been married eight weeks to a man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chose freely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Chose freely!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you repeat it? ... But I have to go back by the six o'clock
train. You will be staying on here, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a few days to wind up Aunt's affairs. This house is gone now.
Shall I go to the train with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>A little laugh of objection came from Sue. <div class="bookquote">``I think not. You may
come part of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But stop--you can't go to-night! That train won't take you to
Shaston. You must stay and go back to-morrow. Mrs. Edlin has plenty
of room, if you don't like to stay here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said dubiously. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) I would come for
certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude went to the widow's house adjoining, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) know; and
returning in a few minutes sat down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is horrible how we are circumstanced, Sue--horrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said
abruptly, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes bent to the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you all my part of the gloom. Your part is that you
ought not to have married him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I saw it before you had done it, but
I thought I mustn't interfere. I was wrong. I ought to have!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what makes you assume all this, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--I can see you through your feathers, my poor little bird!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand lay on the table, and Jude put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) upon it. Sue drew hers
away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's absurd, Sue,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``after what we've been talking about!
I am more strict and formal than you, if it comes to that; and that
you should object to such an innocent action shows that you are
ridiculously inconsistent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it was too prudish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said repentantly. <div class="bookquote">``Only I have
fancied it was a sort of trick of ours--too frequent perhaps. There,
you may hold it as much as you like. Is that good of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--of course, if you think it necessary. But as it means nothing
it may be bothering him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) needlessly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--are you sure you mean it only as my cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely sure. I have no feelings of love left in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's news. How has it come to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen Arabella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) winced at the hit; then said curiously, <div class="bookquote">``When did you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I was at Christminster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'s come back; and you never told me! I suppose you will live
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course--just as you live with your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses,
withered for want of attention, and through them at the outer
distance, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes began to grow moist. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said
Jude, in a softened tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you be so glad to go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) if--if what you used to
say to me is still true--I mean if it were true then! Of course it
is not now! How could your heart go back to Arabella so soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A special Providence, I suppose, helped it on its way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--it isn't true!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said with gentle resentment. <div class="bookquote">``You are
teasing me--that's all--because you think I am not happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I don't wish to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were unhappy it would be my fault, my wickedness; not that
I should have a right to dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) is considerate to me in
everything; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) is very interesting, from the amount of general
knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) has acquired by reading everything that comes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
way... Do you think, Jude, that a man ought to marry a woman his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own age, or one younger than himself--eighteen years--as I am than
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It depends upon what they feel for each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) no opportunity of self-satisfaction, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had to go on
unaided, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did in a vanquished tone, verging on tears:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I think I must be equally honest with you as you have been with
me. Perhaps you have seen what it is I want to say?--that though I
like Mr. Phillotson as a friend, I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)--it is a torture to
me to--live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) as a husband!--There, now I have let it out--I
couldn't help it, although I have been--pretending I am happy.--Now
you'll have a contempt for me for ever, I suppose!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bent down
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hands as they lay upon the cloth, and silently
sobbed in little jerks that made the fragile three-legged table
quiver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only been married a month or two!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went on, still
remaining bent upon the table, and sobbing into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``And it
is said that what a woman shrinks from--in the early days of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
marriage--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shakes down to with comfortable indifference in half a
dozen years. But that is much like saying that the amputation of a
limb is no affliction, since a person gets comfortably accustomed to
the use of a wooden leg or arm in the course of time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude could hardly speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought there was something
wrong, Sue! Oh, I thought there was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is not as you think!--there is nothing wrong except my own
wickedness, I suppose you'd call it--a repugnance on my part, for a
reason I cannot disclose, and what would not be admitted as one by
the world in general! ... What tortures me so much is the necessity
of being responsive to this man whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wishes, good as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
morally!--the dreadful contract to feel in a particular way in a
matter whose essence is its voluntariness! ... I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would beat
me, or be faithless to me, or do some open thing that I could talk
about as a justification for feeling as I do! But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does nothing,
except that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has grown a little cold since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has found out how I
feel. That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't come to the funeral... Oh, I am very
miserable--I don't know what to do! ... Don't come near me, Jude,
because you mustn't. Don't--don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had jumped up and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face against hers--or rather against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) ear, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face being inaccessible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you not to, Jude!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you did--I only wish to--console you! It all arose through
my being married before we met, didn't it? You would have been my
wife, Sue, wouldn't you, if it hadn't been for that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of replying she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) rose quickly, and saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was going to
walk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) aunt's grave in the churchyard to recover herself, went
out of the house. Jude did not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). Twenty minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cross the village green towards Mrs. Edlin's, and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>)
sent a little girl to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) bag, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) was too tired
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) again that night.

<p/>In the lonely room of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt's house, Jude sat watching the
cottage of the Widow Edlin as it disappeared behind the night shade.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew that Sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and
disheartened; and again questioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) devotional motto that all was
for the best.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) retired to rest early, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sleep was fitful from the sense
that Sue was so near at hand. At some time near two o'clock, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was beginning to sleep more soundly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was aroused by a shrill
squeak that had been familiar enough to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lived regularly
at Marygreen. It was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin. As was
the little creature's habit, it did not soon repeat its cry; and
probably would not do so more than once or twice; but would remain
bearing its torture till the morrow when the trapper would come and
knock it on the head.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>) who in his (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>) childhood had saved the lives of the earthworms now
began to picture the agonies of the rabbit from its lacerated leg.
If it were a <div class="bookquote">``bad catch''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>by the hind-leg, the animal would tug
during the ensuing six hours till the iron teeth of the trap had
stripped the leg-bone of its flesh, when, should a weak-springed
instrument enable it to escape, it would die in the fields from the
mortification of the limb. If it were a <div class="bookquote">``good catch,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>namely, by the
fore-leg, the bone would be broken and the limb nearly torn in two in
attempts at an impossible escape.

<p/>Almost half an hour passed, and the rabbit repeated its cry. Jude
could rest no longer till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had put it out of its pain, so dressing
himself quickly he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) descended, and by the light of the moon went
across the green in the direction of the sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reached the hedge
bordering the widow's garden, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stood still. The faint click
of the trap as dragged about by the writhing animal guided him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now,
and reaching the spot he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) struck the rabbit on the back of the neck
with the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) palm, and it stretched itself out dead.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was turning away when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw a woman looking out of the open
casement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage.
<div class="bookquote">``Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice timidly--Sue's voice. <div class="bookquote">``It is you--is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't been able to sleep at all, and then I heard the rabbit,
and couldn't help thinking of what it suffered, till I felt I must
come down and kill it! But I am so glad you got there first... They
ought not to be allowed to set these steel traps, ought they!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude had reached the window, which was quite a low one, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was visible down to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waist. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) let go the casement-stay and put
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moonlit face regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wistfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did it keep you awake?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I was awake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you know--now! I know you, with your religious doctrines, think
that a married woman in trouble of a kind like mine commits a mortal
sin in making a man the confidant of it, as I did you. I wish I
hadn't, now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't wish it, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That may have BEEN my view; but my
doctrines and I begin to part company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it--I knew it! And that's why I vowed I wouldn't disturb
your belief. But--I am SO GLAD to see you!--and, oh, I didn't mean
to see you again, now the last tie between us, Aunt Drusilla, is
dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude seized her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand and kissed it. <div class="bookquote">``There is a stronger one left!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll never care about my doctrines or my religion any
more! Let them go! Let me help you, even if I do love you, and even
if you...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say it!--I know what you mean; but I can't admit so much as
that. There! Guess what you like, but don't press me to answer
questions!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you were happy, whatever I may be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I CAN<div class="bookquote">``T be! So few could enter into my feeling--they would say
'twas my fanciful fastidiousness, or something of that sort, and
condemn me... It is none of the natural tragedies of love that's
love's usual tragedy in civilized life, but a tragedy artificially
manufactured for people who in a natural state would find relief in
parting! ... It would have been wrong, perhaps, for me to tell my
distress to you, if I had been able to tell it to anybody else. But
I have nobody. And I MUST tell somebody! Jude, before I married
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) I had never thought out fully what marriage meant, even though I
knew. It was idiotic of me--there is no excuse. I was old enough,
and I thought I was very experienced. So I rushed on, when I had got
into that training school scrape, with all the cock-sureness of the
fool that I was! ... I am certain one ought to be allowed to undo
what one had done so ignorantly! I daresay it happens to lots of
women, only they submit, and I kick... When people of a later age
look back upon the barbarous customs and superstitions of the times
that we have the unhappiness to live in, what WILL they say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very bitter, darling Sue! How I wish--I wish--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must go in now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In a moment of impulse she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bent over the sill, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hair, weeping, and then imprinting a scarcely perceptible little
kiss upon the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head, withdrawing quickly, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could
not put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) unquestionably would have
done. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shut the casement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cottage.



<p/>III


<p/>Sue's distressful confession recurred to Jude's mind all the night as
being a sorrow indeed.

<p/>The morning after, when it was time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to go, the neighbours saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path
which led into the lonely road to Alfredston. An hour passed before
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) returned along the same route, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) face there was a look of
exaltation not unmixed with recklessness. An incident had occurred.

<p/>They had stood parting in the silent highway, and their tense and
passionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how
far their intimacy ought to go; till they had almost quarrelled, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said tearfully that it was hardly proper of him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) as a parson in
embryo to think of such a thing as kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) even in farewell as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
now wished to do. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had conceded that the fact of the kiss
would be nothing: all would depend upon the spirit of it. If given
in the spirit of a cousin and a friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) saw no objection: if in
the spirit of a lover she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could not permit it. <div class="bookquote">``Will you swear that
it will not be in that spirit?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had said.

<p/>No: he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would not. And then they had turned from each other in
estrangement, and gone their several ways, till at a distance
of twenty or thirty yards both had looked round simultaneously.
That look behind was fatal to the reserve hitherto more or less
maintained. They had quickly run back, and met, and embracing most
unpremeditatedly, kissed close and long. When they parted for good
it was with flushed cheeks on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) side, and a beating heart on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>).

<p/>The kiss was a turning-point in Jude's career. Back again in the
cottage, and left to reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) saw one thing: that though
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
faultful life, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) nourished this unlicensed tenderness it
was glaringly inconsistent for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to pursue the idea of becoming the
soldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded
as at its best a frailty, and at its worst damnation. What Sue
had said in warmth was really the cold truth. When to defend
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) affection tooth and nail, to persist with headlong force in
impassioned attentions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), was all he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) thought of, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was
condemned _ipso facto_ as a professor of the accepted school of
morals. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was as unfit, obviously, by nature, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had been by
social position, to fill the part of a propounder of accredited
dogma.

<p/>Strange that his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) first aspiration--towards academical
proficiency--had been checked by a woman, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) second
aspiration--towards apostleship--had also been checked by a woman.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that the women are to blame; or is it the
artificial system of things, under which the normal sex-impulses are
turned into devilish domestic gins and springs to noose and hold back
those who want to progress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) standing desire to become a prophet, however humble,
to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) struggling fellow-creatures, without any thought of personal
gain. Yet with a wife living away from him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) with another husband, and
himself in love erratically, the loved one's revolt against her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) state
being possibly on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) account, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had sunk to be barely respectable
according to regulation views.

<p/>It was not for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to consider further: he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had only to confront the
obvious, which was that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had made himself quite an impostor as a
law-abiding religious teacher.

<p/>At dusk that evening he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) went into the garden and dug a shallow hole,
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) brought out all the theological and ethical works that
he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) possessed, and had stored here. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knew that, in this country of
true believers, most of them were not saleable at a much higher price
than waste-paper value, and preferred to get rid of them in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own
way, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should sacrifice a little money to the sentiment of
thus destroying them. Lighting some loose pamphlets to begin with,
he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cut the volumes into pieces as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could, and with a
three-pronged fork shook them over the flames. They kindled, and
lighted up the back of the house, the pigsty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own face, till
they were more or less consumed.

<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was almost a stranger here now, passing cottagers talked to
him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) over the garden hedge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge, I suppose? Ay; a lot gets
heaped up in nooks and corners when you've lived eighty years in one
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jeremy</b></font>)</div><p/>It was nearly one o'clock in the morning before the leaves, covers,
and binding of Jeremy Taylor, Butler, Doddridge, Paley, Pusey, Newman
and the rest had gone to ashes, but the night was quiet, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
turned and turned the paper shreds with the fork, the sense of being
no longer a hypocrite to himself afforded his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) mind a relief which
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) calm. He (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) might go on believing as before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) professed
nothing, and no longer owned and exhibited engines of faith which,
as their proprietor, he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) might naturally be supposed to exercise on
himself first of all. In his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) passion for Sue he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) could not stand as
an ordinary sinner, and not as a whited sepulchre.

<p/>Meanwhile Sue, after parting from him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) earlier in the day, had gone
along to the station, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes for having run back and
let him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). Jude ought not to have pretended that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was not a
lover, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) give way to an impulse to act unconventionally,
if not wrongly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was inclined to call it the latter; for Sue's
logic was extraordinarily compounded, and seemed to maintain that
before a thing was done it might be right to do, but that being done
it became wrong; or, in other words, that things which were right in
theory were wrong in practice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been too weak, I think!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) jerked out as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pranced on,
shaking down tear-drops now and then. <div class="bookquote">``It was burning, like a
lover's--oh, it was! And I won't write to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) any more, or at least
for a long time, to impress him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) with my dignity! And I hope it will
hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) very much--expecting a letter to-morrow morning, and the
next, and the next, and no letter coming. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)'ll suffer then with
suspense--won't he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), that's all!--and I am very glad of it!'' (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>--Tears
of pity for Jude's approaching sufferings at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hands mingled with
those which had surged up in pity for herself.

<p/>Then the slim little wife of a husband whose person was disagreeable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), the ethereal, fine-nerved, sensitive girl, quite unfitted by
temperament and instinct to fulfil the conditions of the matrimonial
relation with Phillotson, possibly with scarce any man, walked
fitfully along, and panted, and brought weariness into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes by
gazing and worrying hopelessly.

<p/>Phillotson met her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at the arrival station, and, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
troubled, thought it must be owing to the depressing effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
aunt's death and funeral. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) began telling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) day's doings,
and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend Gillingham, a neighbouring schoolmaster whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
had not seen for years, had called upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). While ascending to the
town, seated on the top of the omnibus beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said suddenly
and with an air of self-chastisement, regarding the white road and
its bordering bushes of hazel:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard--I let Mr. Fawley hold my hand a long while. I don't know
whether you think it wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), waking apparently from thoughts of far different mould, said
vaguely, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, did you? What did you do that for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) wanted to, and I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>). I should think it was hardly a novelty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They lapsed into silence. Had this been a case in the court of an
omniscient judge, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) might have entered on his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) notes the curious fact
that Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion, and had not
said a word about the kiss.

<p/>After tea that evening Phillotson sat balancing the school registers.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) remained in an unusually silent, tense, and restless condition,
and at last, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was tired, went to bed early. When
Phillotson arrived upstairs, weary with the drudgery of the
attendance-numbers, it was a quarter to twelve o'clock. Entering
their chamber, which by day commanded a view of some thirty or forty
miles over the Vale of Blackmoor, and even into Outer Wessex, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) went
to the window, and, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) face against the pane, gazed with
hard-breathing fixity into the mysterious darkness which now covered
the far-reaching scene. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was musing, <div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said at last,
without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``that I must get the committee to change
the school-stationer. All the copybooks are sent wrong this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no reply. Thinking Sue was dozing he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there must be a rearrangement of that ventilator in the
class-room. The wind blows down upon my head unmercifully and gives
me the ear-ache.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As the silence seemed more absolute than ordinarily he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) turned round.
The heavy, gloomy oak wainscot, which extended over the walls
upstairs and down in the dilapidated <div class="bookquote">``Old-Grove Place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the
massive chimney-piece reaching to the ceiling, stood in odd contrast
to the new and shining brass bedstead, and the new suite of birch
furniture that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had bought for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), the two styles seeming to nod
to each other across three centuries upon the shaking floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Soo!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said -LRB-this being the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) name-RRB-.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was not in the bed, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had apparently been there--the
clothes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) side being flung back. Thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) might have
forgotten some kitchen detail and gone downstairs for a moment to
see to it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) coat and idled quietly enough for a
few minutes, when, finding she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not come, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) went out upon the
landing, candle in hand, and said again <div class="bookquote">``Soo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) voice, from the distant kitchen
quarter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing down there at midnight--tiring yourself out for
nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sleepy; I am reading; and there is a larger fire here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) went to bed. Some time in the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) awoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was not there,
even now. Lighting a candle he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) hastily stepped out upon the landing,
and again called her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) name.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) answered <div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>as before, but the tones were small and confined,
and whence they came he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could not at first understand. Under the
staircase was a large clothes-closet, without a window; they seemed
to come from it. The door was shut, but there was no lock or other
fastening. Phillotson, alarmed, went towards it, wondering if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had suddenly become deranged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing in there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to disturb you I came here, as it was so late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there's no bed, is there? And no ventilation! Why, you'll be
suffocated if you stay all night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I think not. Don't trouble about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>Phillotson seized the knob and pulled at the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
fastened it inside with a piece of string, which broke at his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) pull.
There being no bedstead she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had flung down some rugs and made a
little nest for herself in the very cramped quarters the closet
afforded.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) looked in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sprang out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lair, great-eyed and
trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought not to have pulled open the door!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cried excitedly.
<div class="bookquote">``It is not becoming in you! Oh, will you go away; please will you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked so pitiful and pleading in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) white nightgown against the
shadowy lumber-hole that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was quite worried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) continued to
beseech him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) not to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I've been kind to you, and given you every liberty; and it
is monstrous that you should feel in this way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), weeping. <div class="bookquote">``I know that! It is wrong and wicked of
me, I suppose! I am very sorry. But it is not I altogether that am
to blame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is then? Am I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I don't know! The universe, I suppose--things in general,
because they are so horrid and cruel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is no use talking like that. Making a man's house so
unseemly at this time o' night! Eliza will hear if we don't mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) meant the servant.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Just think if either of the parsons in this
town was to see us now! I hate such eccentricities, Sue. There's no
order or regularity in your sentiments! ... But I won't intrude on
you further; only I would advise you not to shut the door too tight,
or I shall find you stifled to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On rising the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) immediately looked into the closet, but
Sue had already gone downstairs. There was a little nest where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had lain, and spiders' webs hung overhead. <div class="bookquote">``What must a woman's
aversion be when it is stronger than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fear of spiders!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said
bitterly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sitting at the breakfast-table, and the meal began
almost in silence, the burghers walking past upon the pavement--or
rather roadway, pavements being scarce here--which was two or three
feet above the level of the parlour floor. They nodded down to the
happy couple their morning greetings, as they went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said all at once; <div class="bookquote">``would you mind my living away from
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Away from me? Why, that's what you were doing when I married you.
What then was the meaning of marrying at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't like me any the better for telling you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't object to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I thought I could do nothing else. You had got my promise a
long time before that, remember. Then, as time went on, I regretted
I had promised you, and was trying to see an honourable way to break
it off. But as I couldn't I became rather reckless and careless
about the conventions. Then you know what scandals were spread, and
how I was turned out of the training school you had taken such time
and trouble to prepare me for and get me into; and this frightened
me and it seemed then that the one thing I could do would be to let
the engagement stand. Of course I, of all people, ought not to have
cared what was said, for it was just what I fancied I never did care
for. But I was a coward--as so many women are--and my theoretic
unconventionality broke down. If that had not entered into the case
it would have been better to have hurt your feelings once for all
then, than to marry you and hurt them all my life after... And you
were so generous in never giving credit for a moment to the rumour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am bound in honesty to tell you that I weighed its probability and
inquired of your cousin about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said with pained surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't doubt you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you inquired!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I took his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes had filled. <div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wouldn't have inquired!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``But you haven't answered me. Will you let me go away? I know how
irregular it is of me to ask it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is irregular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do ask it! Domestic laws should be made according to

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the use of thinking of laws and ordinances,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) burst out,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You distress me, Susanna, by such importunity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't we agree to free each other? We made the compact, and

to either. Oh Richard, be my friend and have pity! We shall both be
dead in a few years, and then what will it matter to anybody that you
relieved me from constraint for a little while? I daresay you think
me eccentric, or super-sensitive, or something absurd. Well--why
should I suffer for what I was born to be, if it doesn't hurt other
people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it does--it hurts ME! And you vowed to love me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--that's it! I am in the wrong. I always am! It is as culpable

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you mean, by living away from me, living by yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you insisted, yes. But I meant living with Jude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>Phillotson writhed.

<p/>Sue continued: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), or he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), `who lets the world, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own portion
of it, choose his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) plan of life for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), has no need of any other
faculty than the apelike one of imitation.''  (<font color='red'><b>J.</b></font>)</div>J. S. Mill's words,
those are. I have been reading it up. Why can't you act upon them?
I wish to, always.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I care about J. S. Mill!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>moaned he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I only want to lead
a quiet life! Do you mind my saying that I have guessed what never
once occurred to me before our marriage--that you were in love, and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may go on guessing that I am, since you have begun. But do you
suppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and
live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>The ringing of the school bell saved Phillotson from the necessity of
replying at present to what apparently did not strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) as being
such a convincing _argumentum ad verecundiam_ as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) loss of
courage at the last moment, meant it to appear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was beginning to
be so puzzling and unstateable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was ready to throw in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
other little peculiarities the extremest request which a wife could
make.

<p/>They proceeded to the schools that morning as usual, Sue entering
the class-room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could see the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head through the
glass partition whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) eyes that way. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) went on
giving and hearing lessons his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) forehead and eyebrows twitched from
concentrated agitation of thought, till at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) tore a scrap
from a sheet of scribbling paper and wrote:


<p/>Your request prevents my attending to work at all. I don't
know what I am doing! Was it seriously made?


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) folded the piece of paper very small, and gave it to a little
boy to take to Sue. The child toddled off into the class-room.
Phillotson saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) wife turn and take the note, and the bend of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
pretty head as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) read it, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips slightly crisped, to prevent
undue expression under fire of so many young eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could not see
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) position, and soon the child returned,
bringing nothing in reply. In a few minutes, however, one of Sue's
class appeared, with a little note similar to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) own. These words
only were pencilled therein:


<p/>I am sincerely sorry to say that it was seriously made.


<p/>Phillotson looked more disturbed than before, and the meeting-place
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) brows twitched again. In ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) called up the child
he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had just sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and dispatched another missive:


<p/>God knows I don't want to thwart you in any reasonable way.
My whole thought is to make you comfortable and happy. But
I cannot agree to such a preposterous notion as your going
to live with your lover. You would lose everybody's respect
and regard; and so should I!


<p/>After an interval a similar part was enacted in the class-room, and
an answer came:


<p/>I know you mean my good. But I don't want to be respectable!
To produce <div class="bookquote">``Human development in its richest diversity''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-to
quote your Humboldt-RRB- is to my mind far above respectability.
No doubt my tastes are low--in your view--hopelessly low!
If you won t let me go to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), will you grant me this one
request--allow me to live in your house in a separate way?


<p/>To this he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) returned no answer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wrote again:


<p/>I know what you think. But cannot you have pity on me? I beg
you to; I implore you to be merciful! I would not ask if I
were not almost compelled by what I can't bear! No poor woman
has ever wished more than I that Eve had not fallen, so that
-LRB-as the primitive Christians believed-RRB- some harmless mode of
vegetation might have peopled Paradise. But I won't trifle!
Be kind to me--even though I have not been kind to you! I
will go away, go abroad, anywhere, and never trouble you.


<p/>Nearly an hour passed, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) returned an answer:


<p/>I do not wish to pain you. How well you KNOW I don't! Give me
a little time. I am disposed to agree to your last request.


<p/>One line from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>):


<p/>Thank you from my heart, Richard. I do not deserve your
kindness.


<p/>All day Phillotson bent a dazed regard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) through the glazed
partition; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) felt as lonely as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had not known her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) word, and consented to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) living apart
in the house. At first, when they met at meals, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had seemed
more composed under the new arrangement; but the irksomeness of
their position worked on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) temperament, and the fibres of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
nature seemed strained like harp-strings. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) talked vaguely and
indiscriminately to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) talking pertinently.



<p/>IV


<p/>Phillotson was sitting up late, as was often his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) custom, trying to
get together the materials for his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) long-neglected hobby of Roman
antiquities. For the first time since reviving the subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) felt a
return of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) old interest in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) forgot time and place, and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) remembered himself and ascended to rest it was nearly two o'clock.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) preoccupation was such that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) now slept on the other
side of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) mechanically went to the room that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
wife had occupied when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) first became a tenant of Old-Grove Place,
which since his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) differences with Sue had been hers exclusively.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) entered, and unconsciously began to undress.

<p/>There was a cry from the bed, and a quick movement. Before the
schoolmaster had realized where he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) perceived Sue starting up
half-awake, staring wildly, and springing out upon the floor on the
side away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), which was towards the window. This was somewhat
hidden by the canopy of the bedstead, and in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
flinging up the sash. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) meant to do
more than get air she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had mounted upon the sill and leapt out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
disappeared in the darkness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) fall below.

<p/>Phillotson, horrified, ran downstairs, striking himself sharply
against the newel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) haste. Opening the heavy door he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) ascended
the two or three steps to the level of the ground, and there on the
gravel before him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) lay a white heap. Phillotson seized it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
arms, and bringing Sue into the hall seated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) on a chair, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) by the flapping light of the candle which he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had set
down in the draught on the bottom stair.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had certainly not broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) with eyes
that seemed not to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) in; and though not particularly large in
general they appeared so now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) side and rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
arm, as if conscious of pain; then stood up, averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face, in
evident distress at his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) gaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God--you are not killed! Though it's not for want of
trying--not much hurt I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) fall, in fact, had not been a serious one, probably owing to the
lowness of the old rooms and to the high level of the ground without.
Beyond a scraped elbow and a blow in the side she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had apparently
incurred little harm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was asleep, I think!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) began, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pale face still turned away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And something frightened me--a terrible dream--I thought
I saw you--''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The actual circumstances seemed to come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was silent.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cloak was hanging at the back of the door, and the wretched
Phillotson flung it round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Shall I help you upstairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) asked
drearily; for the significance of all this sickened him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) of himself
and of everything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No thank you, Richard. I am very little hurt. I can walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to lock your door,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) mechanically said, as if lecturing
in school. <div class="bookquote">``Then no one could intrude even by accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have tried--it won't lock. All the doors are out of order.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The aspect of things was not improved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) admission. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) ascended
the staircase slowly, the waving light of the candle shining on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).
Phillotson did not approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), or attempt to ascend himself till he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) enter her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) room. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) fastened up the front door, and
returning, sat down on the lower stairs, holding the newel with one
hand, and bowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) face into the other. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) remained for a
long long time--a pitiable object enough to one who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>);
till, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) head and sighing a sigh which seemed to say that
the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) life must be carried on, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had a wife or
no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) took the candle and went upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) lonely room on the
other side of the landing.

<p/>No further incident touching the matter between them occurred till
the following evening, when, immediately school was over, Phillotson
walked out of Shaston, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) required no tea, and not informing
Sue where he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was going. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) descended from the town level by a steep
road in a north-westerly direction, and continued to move downwards
till the soil changed from its white dryness to a tough brown clay.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was now on the low alluvial beds


<p/>Where Duncliffe is the traveller's mark,
And cloty Stour's a-rolling dark.


<p/>More than once he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) looked back in the increasing obscurity of evening.
Against the sky was Shaston, dimly visible


<p/>On the grey-topp'd height
Of Paladore, as pale day wore
Away... -LSB-William Barnes.-RSB-


<p/>The new-lit lights from its windows burnt with a steady shine as if
watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>), one of which windows was his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) own. Above it he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) could
just discern the pinnacled tower of Trinity Church. The air down
here, tempered by the thick damp bed of tenacious clay, was not as it
had been above, but soft and relaxing, so that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) had walked a
mile or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) was obliged to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) handkerchief.

<p/>Leaving Duncliffe Hill on the left he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) proceeded without hesitation
through the shade, as a man goes on, night or day, in a district over
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has played as a boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had walked altogether about four
and a half miles


<p/>Where Stour receives her (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) strength,
From six cleere fountains fed, -LSB-Drayton.-RSB-


<p/>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Drayton</b></font>) crossed a tributary of the Stour, and reached Leddenton--a
little town of three or four thousand inhabitants--where he (<font color='blue'><b>Drayton</b></font>) went
on to the boys' school, and knocked at the door of the master's
residence.

<p/>A boy pupil-teacher opened it, and to Phillotson's inquiry if Mr.
Gillingham was at home, replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was, going at once off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
own house, and leaving Phillotson to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) way in as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend putting away some books from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had been
giving evening lessons. The light of the paraffin lamp fell on
Phillotson's face--pale and wretched by contrast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend's,
who had a cool, practical look. They had been schoolmates in
boyhood, and fellow-students at Wintoncester Training College, many
years before this time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to see you, Dick! But you don't look well! Nothing the
matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>Phillotson advanced without replying, and Gillingham closed the
cupboard and pulled up beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) visitor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why you haven't been here--let me see--since you were married?
I called, you know, but you were out; and upon my word it is such a
climb after dark that I have been waiting till the days are longer
before lumpering up again. I am glad you didn't wait, however.''

 (<font color='red'><b>masters</b></font>)</div><p/>Though well-trained and even proficient masters, they occasionally
used a dialect-word of their boyhood to each other in private.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come, George, to explain to you my reasons for taking a step
that I am about to take, so that you, at least, will understand my
motives if other people question them anywhen--as they may, indeed
certainly will... But anything is better than the present condition
of things. God forbid that you should ever have such an experience
as mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down. You don't mean--anything wrong between you and Mrs.
Phillotson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do... My wretched state is that I've a wife I love who not
only does not love me, but--but-- Well, I won't say. I know her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
feeling! I should prefer hatred from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ssh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the sad part of it is that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is not so much to blame as I. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
was a pupil-teacher under me, as you know, and I took advantage of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inexperience, and toled her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) out for walks, and got her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to agree
to a long engagement before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) well knew her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own mind. Afterwards
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw somebody else, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) blindly fulfilled her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Loving the other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; with a curious tender solicitude seemingly; though her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) exact
feeling for him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is a riddle to me--and to him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) too, I think--possibly
to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is one of the oddest creatures I ever met. However,
I have been struck with these two facts; the extraordinary sympathy,
or similarity, between the pair. He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cousin, which perhaps
accounts for some of it. They seem to be one person split in two!
And with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) unconquerable aversion to myself as a husband, even
though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may like me as a friend, `tis too much to bear longer.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has conscientiously struggled against it, but to no purpose.
I cannot bear it--I cannot! I can't answer her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arguments--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has
read ten times as much as I. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) intellect sparkles like diamonds,
while mine smoulders like brown paper... She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s one too many for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll get over it, good-now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! It is--but I won't go into it--there are reasons why she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
never will. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) calmly and firmly asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might leave
me and go to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). The climax came last night, when, owing to my
entering her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room by accident, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) jumped out of window--so strong
was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dread of me! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pretended it was a dream, but that was
to soothe me. Now when a woman jumps out of window without caring
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breaks her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck or no, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not to be mistaken; and this
being the case I have come to a conclusion: that it is wrong to so
torture a fellow-creature any longer; and I won't be the inhuman
wretch to do it, cost what it may!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--you'll let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go? And with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom with is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) matter. I shall let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go; with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) certainly,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wishes. I know I may be wrong--I know I can't logically,
or religiously, defend my concession to such a wish of hers, or
harmonize it with the doctrines I was brought up in. Only I know one
thing: something within me tells me I am doing wrong in refusing
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I, like other men, profess to hold that if a husband gets such
a so-called preposterous request from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, the only course that
can possibly be regarded as right and proper and honourable in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is
to refuse it, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) virtuously under lock and key, and murder
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover perhaps. But is that essentially right, and proper, and
honourable, or is it contemptibly mean and selfish? I don't profess
to decide. I simply am going to act by instinct, and let principles
take care of themselves. If a person who has blindly walked into a
quagmire cries for help, I am inclined to give it, if possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--you see, there's the question of neighbours and society--what

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am not going to be a philosopher any longer! I only see
what's under my eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I don't agree with your instinct, Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div>said Gillingham
gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I am quite amazed, to tell the truth, that such a sedate,
plodding fellow as you should have entertained such a craze for a
moment. You said when I called that she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was puzzling and peculiar:
I think you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever stood before a woman whom you know to be intrinsically
a good woman, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has pleaded for release--been the man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thankful to say I haven't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't think you are in a position to give an opinion. I
have been that man, and it makes all the difference in the world, if
one has any manliness or chivalry in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I had not the remotest
idea--living apart from women as I have done for so many years--that
merely taking a woman to church and putting a ring upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finger
could by any possibility involve one in such a daily, continuous
tragedy as that now shared by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I could admit some excuse for letting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leave you, provided
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept to herself. But to go attended by a cavalier--that makes a
difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit. Suppose, as I believe, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would rather endure her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)

All that is a question for herself. It is not the same thing at
all as the treachery of living on with a husband and playing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
false... However, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has not distinctly implied living with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
as wife, though I think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) means to... And, to the best of my
understanding, it is not an ignoble, merely animal, feeling between
the two: that is the worst of it; because it makes me think their
affection will be enduring. I did not mean to confess to you that in
the first jealous weeks of my marriage, before I had come to my right
mind, I hid myself in the school one evening when they were together
there, and I heard what they said. I am ashamed of it now, though
I suppose I was only exercising a legal right. I found from their
manner that an extraordinary affinity, or sympathy, entered into
their attachment, which somehow took away all flavour of grossness.
Their supreme desire is to be together--to share each other's
emotions, and fancies, and dreams.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well no. Shelleyan would be nearer to it. They remind me of--what

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little thinks I have out-Sued Sue in this--all in the

to drink over it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) went under the stairs, and produced a bottle
of cider-wine, of which they drank a rummer each. <div class="bookquote">``I think you are
rafted, and not yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``Do go back and make up

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah yes! That's the bitterness of it! Well, I won't stay. I have a
long walk before me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Gillingham accompanied his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend a mile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) way, and at parting
expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) hope that this consultation, singular as its subject
was, would be the renewal of their old comradeship. <div class="bookquote">``Stick to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>were his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) last words, flung into the darkness after Phillotson; from
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend answered <div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>But when Phillotson was alone under the clouds of night, and no
sound was audible but that of the purling tributaries of the Stour,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``So Gillingham, my friend, you had no stronger arguments
against it than those!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) ought to be smacked, and brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) senses--that's
what I think!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div>murmured Gillingham, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) walked back alone.

<p/>The next morning came, and at breakfast Phillotson told Sue:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may go--with whom you will. I absolutely and unconditionally
agree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>Having once come to this conclusion it seemed to Phillotson more
and more indubitably the true one. His (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) mild serenity at the sense
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) duty by a woman who was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) mercy almost
overpowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) grief at relinquishing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>Some days passed, and the evening of their last meal together had
come--a cloudy evening with wind--which indeed was very seldom absent
in this elevated place. How permanently it was imprinted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
vision; that look of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glided into the parlour to tea;
a slim flexible figure; a face, strained from its roundness, and
marked by the pallors of restless days and nights, suggesting tragic
possibilities quite at variance with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) times of buoyancy; a trying
of this morsel and that, and an inability to eat either. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nervous
manner, begotten of a fear lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) should be injured by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) course,
might have been interpreted by a stranger as displeasure that
Phillotson intruded his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) presence on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for the few brief minutes
that remained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better have a slice of ham or an egg, or something with your
tea? You can't travel on a mouthful of bread and butter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took the slice he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to; and they discussed as they sat
trivial questions of housekeeping, such as where he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) would find the
key of this or that cupboard, what little bills were paid, and what
not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a bachelor by nature, as you know, Sue,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said, in a heroic
attempt to put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ease. ``So that being without a wife will
not really be irksome to me, as it might be to other men who have
had one a little while. I have, too, this grand hobby in my head of
writing ``The Roman Antiquities of Wessex,<div class="bookquote">'' which will occupy all my
spare hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wessex/North Wessex</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will send me some of the manuscript to copy at any time,
as you used to, I will do it with so much pleasure!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said with
amenable gentleness. <div class="bookquote">``I should much like to be some help to you
still--as a--f-f-friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>Phillotson mused, and said: <div class="bookquote">``No, I think we ought to be really
separate, if we are to be at all. And for this reason, that I don't
wish to ask you any questions, and particularly wish you not to give
me information as to your movements, or even your address... Now,
what money do you want? You must have some, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course, Richard, I couldn't think of having any of your money
to go away from you with! I don't want any either. I have enough of
my own to last me for a long while, and Jude will let me have--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather not know anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), if you don't mind.
You are free, absolutely; and your course is your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. But I'll just say that I have packed only a change or
two of my own personal clothing, and one or two little things besides
that are my very own. I wish you would look into my trunk before it
is closed. Besides that I have only a small parcel that will go into
Jude's portmanteau.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall do no such thing as examine your luggage! I wish
you would take three-quarters of the household furniture. I don't
want to be bothered with it. I have a sort of affection for a little
of it that belonged to my poor mother and father. But the rest you
are welcome to whenever you like to send for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I shall never do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go by the six-thirty train, don't you? It is now a quarter to
six.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You... You don't seem very sorry I am going, Richard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no--perhaps not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like you much for how you have behaved. It is a curious thing
that directly I have begun to regard you as not my husband, but as
my old teacher, I like you. I won't be so affected as to say I love
you, because you know I don't, except as a friend. But you do seem
that to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections, and
then the station omnibus came round to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up. Phillotson saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) things put on the top, handed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in, and was obliged to make an
appearance of kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good-bye, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quite
understood and imitated. From the cheerful manner in which they
parted the omnibus-man had no other idea than that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going for
a short visit.

<p/>When Phillotson got back into the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) went upstairs and opened
the window in the direction the omnibus had taken. Soon the noise of
its wheels died away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) came down then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) face compressed like
that of one bearing pain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) hat and went out, following
by the same route for nearly a mile. Suddenly turning round he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) came
home.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had no sooner entered than the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend Gillingham
greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) from the front room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could make nobody hear; so finding your door open I walked in, and
made myself comfortable. I said I would call, you remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I am much obliged to you, Gillingham, particularly for coming
to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is Mrs.--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is quite well. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is gone--just gone. That's her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tea-cup,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) drank out of only an hour ago. And that's the plate
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>Phillotson's throat got choked up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could not go on.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) turned and pushed the tea-things aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you had any tea, by the by?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) asked presently in a renewed
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--yes--never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div>said Gillingham, preoccupied. <div class="bookquote">``Gone, you say
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes... I would have died for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); but I wouldn't be cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
in the name of the law. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is, as I understand, gone to join her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
lover. What they are going to do I cannot say. Whatever it may be
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has my full consent to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a stability, a ballast, in Phillotson's pronouncement which
restrained his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend's comment. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I--leave you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. It is a mercy to me that you have come. I have some
articles to arrange and clear away. Would you help me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Gillingham assented; and having gone to the upper rooms the
schoolmaster opened drawers, and began taking out all Sue's things
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had left behind, and laying them in a large box. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
wouldn't take all I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``But when I made
up my mind to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) going to live in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own way I did make up my
mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some men would have stopped at an agreement to separate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've gone into all that, and don't wish to argue it. I was, and
am, the most old-fashioned man in the world on the question of
marriage--in fact I had never thought critically about its ethics
at all. But certain facts stared me in the face, and I couldn't go
against them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went on with the packing silently. When it was done Phillotson
closed the box and turned the key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``To adorn her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in somebody's eyes; never again in
mine!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jude</b></font>)</div><p/>V


<p/>Four-and-twenty hours before this time Sue had written the following
note to Jude:


<p/>It is as I told you; and I am leaving to-morrow evening.
Richard and I thought it could be done with less
obtrusiveness after dark. I feel rather frightened, and
therefore ask you to be sure you are on the Melchester
platform to meet me. I arrive at a little to seven. I
know you will, of course, dear Jude; but I feel so timid
that I can't help begging you to be punctual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) has
been so VERY kind to me through it all!

<p/>Now to our meeting!

<p/>S.


<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from
the mountain town--the single passenger that evening--she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) regarded
the receding road with a sad face. But no hesitation was apparent
therein.

<p/>The up-train by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was departing stopped by signal only. To
Sue it seemed strange that such a powerful organization as a railway
train should be brought to a stand-still on purpose for her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)--a
fugitive from her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) lawful home.

<p/>The twenty minutes' journey drew towards its close, and Sue began
gathering her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) things together to alight. At the moment that the
train came to a stand-still by the Melchester platform a hand was
laid on the door and she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) beheld Jude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) entered the compartment
promptly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had a black bag in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand, and was dressed in
the dark suit he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wore on Sundays and in the evening after work.
Altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked a very handsome young fellow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ardent
affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) burning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand with both hers, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) tense state
caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs. <div class="bookquote">``I--I
am so glad! I get out here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I get in, dear one! I've packed. Besides this bag I've only a
big box which is labelled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't I get out? Aren't we going to stay here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We couldn't possibly, don't you see. We are known here--I, at any
rate, am well known. I've booked for Aldbrickham; and here's your
ticket for the same place, as you have only one to here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought we should have stayed here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't have done at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Perhaps not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There wasn't time for me to write and say the place I had decided
on. Aldbrickham is a much bigger town--sixty or seventy thousand
inhabitants--and nobody knows anything about us there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have given up your cathedral work here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It was rather sudden--your message coming unexpectedly.
Strictly, I might have been made to finish out the week. But I
pleaded urgency and I was let off. I would have deserted any day at
your command, dear Sue. I have deserted more than that for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear I am doing you a lot of harm. Ruining your prospects of the
Church; ruining your progress in your trade; everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Church is no more to me. Let it lie! _I_ am not to be one of


<p/>The soldier-saints who, row on row,
Burn upward each to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) point of bliss,


<p/>if any such there be! My point of bliss is not upward, but here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I seem so bad--upsetting men's courses like this!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>),
taking up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) voice the emotion that had begun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) equanimity by the time they had travelled a dozen
miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has been so good in letting me go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) resumed. <div class="bookquote">``And here's a
note I found on my dressing-table, addressed to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s not an unworthy fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, glancing at the note.
<div class="bookquote">``And I am ashamed of myself for hating him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) married you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``According to the rule of women's whims I suppose I ought to suddenly
love him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has let me go so generously and unexpectedly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) answered smiling. <div class="bookquote">``But I am so cold, or devoid of gratitude, or
so something, that even this generosity hasn't made me love him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), or
repent, or want to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wife; although I do feel I
like his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) large-mindedness, and respect him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) more than ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may not work so well for us as if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been less kind, and you
had run away against his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>murmured Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I NEVER would have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude's eyes rested musingly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) face. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) suddenly kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>); and was going to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``No--only once now--please,
Jude!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's rather cruel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) answered; but acquiesced. <div class="bookquote">``Such a strange
thing has happened to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude continued after a silence. <div class="bookquote">``Arabella
has actually written to ask me to get a divorce from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--in kindness
to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wants to honestly and legally marry that man
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has already married virtually; and begs me to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to do
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have agreed. I thought at first I couldn't do it without getting
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) into trouble about that second marriage, and I don't want to
injure her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in any way. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s no worse than I am, after all!
But nobody knows about it over here, and I find it will not be a
difficult proceeding at all. If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wants to start afresh I have
only too obvious reasons for not hindering her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'll be free?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall be free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are we booked for?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) asked, with the discontinuity that
marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) to-night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aldbrickham, as I said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it will be very late when we get there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I thought of that, and I wired for a room for us at the
Temperance Hotel there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sue bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) forehead against the
corner of the compartment. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you might do it; and that I
was deceiving you. But I didn't mean that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>In the pause which followed, Jude's eyes fixed themselves with
a stultified expression on the opposite seat. <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
said... <div class="bookquote">``Well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remained in silence; and seeing how discomfited he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
face against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cheek, murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``Don't be vexed, dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--there's no harm done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But--I understood it like
that... Is this a sudden change of mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no right to ask me such a question; and I shan't answer!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear one, your happiness is more to me than anything--although we
seem to verge on quarrelling so often!--and your will is law to me.
I am something more than a mere--selfish fellow, I hope. Have it as
you wish!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>On reflection his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) brow showed perplexity. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps
it is that you don't love me--not that you have become conventional!
Much as, under your teaching, I hate convention, I hope it IS that,
not the other terrible alternative!''

 (<font color='red'><b>candour Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>Even at this obvious moment for candour Sue could not be quite candid
as to the state of that mystery, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``Put it down to my
timidity,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said with hurried evasiveness; <div class="bookquote">``to a woman's natural
timidity when the crisis comes. I may feel as well as you that I
have a perfect right to live with you as you thought--from this
moment. I may hold the opinion that, in a proper state of society,
the father of a woman's child will be as much a private matter of
hers as the cut of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) underlinen, on whom nobody will have any
right to question her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But partly, perhaps, because it is by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
generosity that I am now free, I would rather not be other than a
little rigid. If there had been a rope-ladder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had run after
us with pistols, it would have seemed different, and I may have acted
otherwise. But don't press me and criticize me, Jude! Assume that
I haven't the courage of my opinions. I know I am a poor miserable
creature. My nature is not so passionate as yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) repeated simply! <div class="bookquote">``I thought--what I naturally thought. But if we
are not lovers, we are not. Phillotson thought so, I am sure. See,
here is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) has written to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) opened the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
brought, and read:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I make only one condition--that you are tender and kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). I
know you love her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). But even love may be cruel at times. You are
made for each other: it is obvious, palpable, to any unbiased older
person. You were all along `the shadowy third' in my short life with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). I repeat, take care of Sue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)'s a good fellow, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said with latent tears. On
reconsideration she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was very resigned to letting me
go--too resigned almost! I never was so near being in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) made such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable
on my journey, and offering to provide money. Yet I was not. If I
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) ever so little as a wife, I'd go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) even now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true--oh so terribly true!--I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor me neither, I half-fear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said pettishly. <div class="bookquote">``Nor anybody
perhaps! Sue, sometimes, when I am vexed with you, I think you are
incapable of real love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not good and loyal of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, and drawing away from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could, looked severely out into the darkness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
added in hurt tones, without turning round: <div class="bookquote">``My liking for you is
not as some women's perhaps. But it is a delight in being with you,
of a supremely delicate kind, and I don't want to go further and risk
it by--an attempt to intensify it! I quite realized that, as woman
with man, it was a risk to come. But, as me with you, I resolved to
trust you to set my wishes above your gratification. Don't discuss
it further, dear Jude!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if it would make you reproach yourself... but you do
like me very much, Sue? Say you do! Say that you do a quarter, a
tenth, as much as I do you, and I'll be content!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've let you kiss me, and that tells enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just once or so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--don't be a greedy boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) leant back, and did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) for a long time. That
episode in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) past history of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)--of the poor
Christminster graduate whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had handled thus, returned to Jude's
mind; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw himself as a possible second in such a torturing
destiny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a queer elopement!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you are making
a cat's paw of me with Phillotson all this time. Upon my word it
almost seems so--to see you sitting up there so prim!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you mustn't be angry--I won't let you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) coaxed, turning and
moving nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You did kiss me just now, you know; and I
didn't dislike you to, I own it, Jude. Only I don't want to let you
do it again, just yet--considering how we are circumstanced, don't
you see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could never resist her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pleaded -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) well knew-RRB-. And
they sat side by side with joined hands, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) aroused herself at
some thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't possibly go to that Temperance Inn, after your telegraphing
that message!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can see well enough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; there'll be some other one open, no doubt. I have
sometimes thought, since your marrying Phillotson because of a stupid
scandal, that under the affectation of independent views you are as
enslaved to the social code as any woman I know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not mentally. But I haven't the courage of my views, as I said
before. I didn't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) altogether because of the scandal.
But sometimes a woman's LOVE OF BEING LOVED gets the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
conscience, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is agonized at the thought of treating a
man cruelly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) encourages him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't love
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at all. Then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffering, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remorse sets in,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can to repair the wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You simply mean that you flirted outrageously with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), poor old
chap, and then repented, and to make reparation, married him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though
you tortured yourself to death by doing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--if you will put it brutally!--it was a little like that--that
and the scandal together--and your concealing from me what you ought
to have told me before!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was distressed and tearful at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) criticisms,
and soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), saying: <div class="bookquote">``There, dear; don't mind! Crucify me, if
you will! You know you are all the world to me, whatever you do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very bad and unprincipled--I know you think that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said,
trying to blink away her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think and know you are my dear Sue, from whom neither length nor
breadth, nor things present nor things to come, can divide me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Though so sophisticated in many things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was such a child in others
that this satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and they reached the end of their journey
on the best of terms. It was about ten o'clock when they arrived at
Aldbrickham, the county town of North Wessex. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would not go
to the Temperance Hotel because of the form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) telegram, Jude
inquired for another; and a youth who volunteered to find one wheeled
their luggage to the George farther on, which proved to be the inn at
which Jude had stayed with Arabella on that one occasion of their
meeting after their division for years.

<p/>Owing, however, to their now entering it by another door, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
preoccupation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not at first recognize the place. When they
had engaged their respective rooms they went down to a late supper.
During Jude's temporary absence the waiting-maid spoke to Sue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, ma'am, I remember your relation, or friend, or whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
is, coming here once before--late, just like this, with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife--a
lady, at any rate, that wasn't you by no manner of means--jest as med
be with you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue, with a certain sickness of heart. <div class="bookquote">``Though I
think you must be mistaken! How long ago was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About a month or two. A handsome, full-figured woman. They had
this room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>When Jude came back and sat down to supper Sue seemed moping and
miserable. <div class="bookquote">``Jude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) plaintively, at their parting
that night upon the landing, <div class="bookquote">``it is not so nice and pleasant as it
used to be with us! I don't like it here--I can't bear the place!
And I don't like you so well as I did!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How fidgeted you seem, dear! Why do you change like this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it was cruel to bring me here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were lately here with Arabella. There, now I have said it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, why--''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes--it is the same!
I really didn't know it, Sue. Well--it is not cruel, since we have
come as we have--two relations staying together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long ago was it you were here? Tell me, tell me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The day before I met you in Christminster, when we went back to
Marygreen together. I told you I had met her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you said you had met her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), but you didn't tell me all. Your
story was that you had met as estranged people, who were not husband
and wife at all in Heaven's sight--not that you had made it up with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We didn't make it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I can't explain, Sue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been false to me; you, my last hope! And I shall never
forget it, never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But by your own wish, dear Sue, we are only to be friends, not
lovers! It is so very inconsistent of you to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Friends can be jealous!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that. You concede nothing to me and I have to concede
everything to you. After all, you were on good terms with your
husband at that time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I wasn't, Jude. Oh how can you think so! And you have taken me
in, even if you didn't intend to.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was so mortified that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was
obliged to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) room and close the door lest the people
should hear. <div class="bookquote">``Was it this room? Yes it was--I see by your look it
was! I won't have it for mine! Oh it was treacherous of you to have
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) again! _I_ jumped out of the window!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Sue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was, after all, my legal wife, if not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Slipping down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knees Sue buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face in the bed and wept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knew such an unreasonable--such a dog-in-the-manger
feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``I am not to approach you, nor anybody else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh don't you UNDERSTAND my feeling? Why don't you? Why are you so
gross? _I_ jumped out of the window!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jumped out of window?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't explain!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) feelings very well. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did a little; and began to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) none the less.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I thought you cared for nobody--desired nobody in the world but
me at that time--and ever since!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>continued Sue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true. I did not, and don't now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, as distressed as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must have thought much of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)! Or--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I need not--you don't understand me either--women never do! Why
should you get into such a tantrum about nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Looking up from the quilt she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pouted provokingly: <div class="bookquote">``If it hadn't been
for that, perhaps I would have gone on to the Temperance Hotel, after
all, as you proposed; for I was beginning to think I did belong to
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it is of no consequence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude distantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, of course, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had never been really your wife since
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) left you of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own accord years and years ago! My sense of it
was, that a parting such as yours from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and mine from him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), ended
the marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say more without speaking against her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and I don't want
to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yet I must tell you one thing, which would
settle the matter in any case. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has married another man--really
married him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! I knew nothing about it till after the visit we made
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married another? ... It is a crime--as the world treats it, but
does not believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There--now you are yourself again. Yes, it is a crime--as you don't
hold, but would fearfully concede. But I shall never inform against
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)! And it is evidently a prick of conscience in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that has led
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to urge me to get a divorce, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may remarry this man
legally. So you perceive I shall not be likely to see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you didn't really know anything of this when you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
Sue more gently, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not. Considering all things, I don't think you ought to be
angry, darling!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not. But I shan't go to the Temperance Hotel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``So that I am near you, I am
comparatively happy. It is more than this earthly wretch called Me
deserves--you spirit, you disembodied creature, you dear, sweet,
tantalizing phantom--hardly flesh at all; so that when I put my arms
round you I almost expect them to pass through you as through air!
Forgive me for being gross, as you call it! Remember that our
calling cousins when really strangers was a snare. The enmity of our
parents gave a piquancy to you in my eyes that was intenser even than
the novelty of ordinary new acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>``Say those pretty lines, then, from Shelley's ``Epipsychidion' as if
they meant me!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) solicited, slanting up closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as they
stood. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know hardly any poetry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) replied mournfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you? These are some of them:


<p/>There was a Being whom my spirit oft
Met on its visioned wanderings far aloft.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>A seraph of Heaven, too gentle to be human,
Veiling beneath that radiant form of woman...


<p/>Oh it is too flattering, so I won't go on! But say it's me! Say
it's me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is you, dear; exactly like you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I forgive you! And you shall kiss me just once there--not very
long.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) put the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) finger gingerly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cheek; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
did as commanded. <div class="bookquote">``You do care for me very much, don't you, in spite
of my not--you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sweet!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said with a sigh; and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) good-night.



<p/>VI


<p/>In returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) native town of Shaston as schoolmaster Phillotson
had won the interest and awakened the memories of the inhabitants,
who, though they did not honour him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) miscellaneous acquirements
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) would have been honoured elsewhere, retained for him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) a sincere
regard. When, shortly after his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) brought home a pretty
wife--awkwardly pretty for him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) did not take care, they
said--they were glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) settle among them.

<p/>For some time after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) flight from that home Sue's absence did not
excite comment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) place as monitor in the school was taken by
another young woman within a few days of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) vacating it, which
substitution also passed without remark, Sue's services having been
of a provisional nature only. When, however, a month had passed, and
Phillotson casually admitted to an acquaintance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) did not know
where his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) wife was staying, curiosity began to be aroused; till,
jumping to conclusions, people ventured to affirm that Sue had played
him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) false and run away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). The schoolmaster's growing languor
and listlessness over his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) work gave countenance to the idea.

<p/>Though Phillotson had held his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) tongue as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could, except to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend Gillingham, his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) honesty and directness would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
to do so when misapprehensions as to Sue's conduct spread abroad.
On a Monday morning the chairman of the school committee called, and
after attending to the business of the school drew Phillotson aside
out of earshot of the children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll excuse my asking, Phillotson, since everybody is talking of
it: is this true as to your domestic affairs--that your wife's going
away was on no visit, but a secret elopement with a lover? If so, I
condole with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson. <div class="bookquote">``There was no secret about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has gone to visit friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has gone away under circumstances that usually call for
condolence with the husband. But I gave my consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chairman</b></font>)</div><p/>The chairman looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had not apprehended the remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I say is quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>Phillotson continued testily. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked
leave to go away with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover, and I let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Why shouldn't I? A
woman of full age, it was a question of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own conscience--not for
me. I was not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gaoler. I can't explain any further. I don't
wish to be questioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The children</b></font>)</div><p/>The children observed that much seriousness marked the faces of
the two men, and went home and told their parents that something
new had happened about Mrs. Phillotson. Then Phillotson's little
maidservant, who was a schoolgirl just out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) standards, said
that Mr. Phillotson had helped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) wife's packing, had offered
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) what money she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) required, and had written a friendly letter to
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) young man, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The chairman of
committee thought the matter over, and talked to the other managers
of the school, till a request came to Phillotson to meet them
privately. The meeting lasted a long time, and at the end the
school-master came home, looking as usual pale and worn. Gillingham
was sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) house awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; it is as you said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>observed Phillotson, flinging himself
down wearily in a chair. <div class="bookquote">``They have requested me to send in my
resignation on account of my scandalous conduct in giving my tortured
wife her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liberty--or, as they call it, condoning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) adultery. But I
shan't resign!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't. It is no business of theirs. It doesn't affect me in my
public capacity at all. They may expel me if they like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you make a fuss it will get into the papers, and you'll never get
appointed to another school. You see, they have to consider what
you did as done by a teacher of youth--and its effects as such upon
the morals of the town; and, to ordinary opinion, your position is
indefensible. You must let me say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>To this good advice, however, Phillotson would not listen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't go unless I am turned out. And
for this reason; that by resigning I acknowledge I have acted wrongly
by her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); when I am more and more convinced every day that in the sight
of Heaven and by all natural, straightforward humanity, I have acted
rightly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Gillingham saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) rather headstrong friend would not be able to
maintain such a position as this; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said nothing further, and
in due time--indeed, in a quarter of an hour--the formal letter of
dismissal arrived, the managers having remained behind to write it
after Phillotson's withdrawal. The latter replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) should not
accept dismissal; and called a public meeting, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) attended,
although he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) looked so weak and ill that his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) to
stay at home. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) stood up to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) reasons for contesting
the decision of the managers he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) advanced them firmly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had
done to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend, and contended, moreover, that the matter was a
domestic theory which did not concern them. This they over-ruled,
insisting that the private eccentricities of a teacher came quite
within their sphere of control, as it touched the morals of those he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
taught. Phillotson replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) did not see how an act of natural
charity could injure morals.

<p/>All the respectable inhabitants and well-to-do fellow-natives of
the town were against Phillotson to a man. But, somewhat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
surprise, some dozen or more champions rose up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) defence as from
the ground.

<p/>It has been stated that Shaston was the anchorage of a curious and
interesting group of itinerants, who frequented the numerous fairs
and markets held up and down Wessex during the summer and autumn
months. Although Phillotson had never spoken to one of these
gentlemen they now nobly led the forlorn hope in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) defence.
The body included two cheap Jacks, a shooting-gallery proprietor
and the ladies who loaded the guns, a pair of boxing-masters, a
steam-roundabout manager, two travelling broom-makers, who called
themselves widows, a gingerbread-stall keeper, a swing-boat owner,
and a <div class="bookquote">``test-your-strength''  (<font color='red'><b>a swing-boat owner</b></font>)</div>man.

<p/>This generous phalanx of supporters, and a few others of independent
judgment, whose own domestic experiences had been not without
vicissitude, came up and warmly shook hands with Phillotson; after
which they expressed their thoughts so strongly to the meeting that
issue was joined, the result being a general scuffle, wherein a black
board was split, three panes of the school windows were broken,
an inkbottle was spilled over a town-councillor's shirt front,
a churchwarden was dealt such a topper with the map of Palestine
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) head went right through Samaria, and many black eyes and
bleeding noses were given, one of which, to everybody's horror, was
the venerable incumbent's, owing to the zeal of an emancipated
chimney-sweep, who took the side of Phillotson's party. When
Phillotson saw the blood running down the rector's face he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) deplored
almost in groans the untoward and degrading circumstances, regretted
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had not resigned when called upon, and went home so ill that
next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) bed.

<p/>The farcical yet melancholy event was the beginning of a serious
illness for him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) lonely bed in the pathetic state
of mind of a middle-aged man who perceives at length that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
life, intellectual and domestic, is tending to failure and gloom.
Gillingham came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the evenings, and on one occasion
mentioned Sue's name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) doesn't care anything about me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson. <div class="bookquote">``Why should
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) doesn't know you are ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better for both of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lover and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Melchester--I suppose; at least he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was living there some time
ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div><p/>When Gillingham reached home he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) sat and reflected, and at last wrote
an anonymous line to Sue, on the bare chance of its reaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>),
the letter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to Jude at the
diocesan capital. Arriving at that place it was forwarded to
Marygreen in North Wessex, and thence to Aldbrickham by the only
person who knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) present address--the widow who had nursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
aunt.

<p/>Three days later, in the evening, when the sun was going down in
splendour over the lowlands of Blackmoor, and making the Shaston
windows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale,
the sick man fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard somebody come to the house, and a
few minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door. Phillotson
did not speak; the door was hesitatingly opened, and there
entered--Sue.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was in light spring clothing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) advent seemed ghostly--like
the flitting in of a moth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and flushed;
but appeared to check his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) primary impulse to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no business here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, bending her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) frightened face to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I heard you were ill--very ill; and--and as I know that
you recognize other feelings between man and woman than physical
love, I have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not very ill, my dear friend. Only unwell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know that; and I am afraid that only a severe illness would
have justified my coming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes... yes. And I almost wish you had not come! It is a little
too soon--that's all I mean. Still, let us make the best of it. You
haven't heard about the school, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--what about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that I am going away from here to another place. The managers
and I don't agree, and we are going to part--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue did not for a moment, either now or later, suspect what troubles
had resulted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) from letting her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) go; it never once seemed to
cross her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had received no news whatever from Shaston.
They talked on slight and ephemeral subjects, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) tea was
brought up he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) told the amazed little servant that a cup was to be set
for Sue. That young person was much more interested in their history
than they supposed, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) descended the stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
eyes and hands in grotesque amazement. While they sipped Sue went
to the window and thoughtfully said, <div class="bookquote">``It is such a beautiful sunset,
Richard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are mostly beautiful from here, owing to the rays crossing the
mist of the vale. But I lose them all, as they don't shine into this
gloomy corner where I lie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you like to see this particular one? It is like heaven
opened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah yes! But I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll help you to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--the bedstead can't be shifted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But see how I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went to where a swing-glass stood, and taking it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hands
carried it to a spot by the window where it could catch the sunshine,
moving the glass till the beams were reflected into Phillotson's
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There--you can see the great red sun now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And I am
sure it will cheer you--I do so hope it will!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) spoke with a
childlike, repentant kindness, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could not do too much for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>).

<p/>Phillotson smiled sadly. <div class="bookquote">``You are an odd creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) murmured as
the sun glowed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``The idea of your coming to see me after
what has passed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us go back upon that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I have to catch
the omnibus for the train, as Jude doesn't know I have come; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was
out when I started; so I must return home almost directly. Richard,
I am so very glad you are better. You don't hate me, do you? You
have been such a kind friend to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to know you think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson huskily. <div class="bookquote">``No.
I don't hate you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It grew dusk quickly in the gloomy room during their intermittent
chat, and when candles were brought and it was time to leave she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) or rather allowed it to flit through his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
significantly light in touch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had nearly closed the door when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had noticed that, in turning away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), tears
were on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face and a quiver in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lip.

<p/>It was bad policy to recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) knew it while he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) pursued it.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) could not help it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) came back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``do you wish to make it up, and stay? I'll
forgive you and condone everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you can't, you can't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said hastily. <div class="bookquote">``You can't condone it
now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is your husband now, in effect, you mean, of course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may assume it. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is obtaining a divorce from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife
Arabella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife! It is altogether news to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a bad marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is not doing it so much on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own account as on
hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wrote and told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) it would be a kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), since
then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could marry and live respectably. And Jude has agreed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A wife... A kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Ah, yes; a kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to release
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) altogether... But I don't like the sound of it. I can forgive,
Sue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! You can't have me back now I have been so wicked--as to do
what I have done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>There had arisen in Sue's face that incipient fright which showed
itself whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) changed from friend to husband, and which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
adopt any line of defence against marital feeling in him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I MUST go
now. I'll come again--may I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't ask you to go, even now. I ask you to stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, Richard; but I must. As you are not so ill as I
thought, I CANNOT stay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'s his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) from lips to heel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson; but so faintly
that in closing the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not hear it. The dread of a
reactionary change in the schoolmaster's sentiments, coupled,
perhaps, with a faint shamefacedness at letting even him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) know
what a slipshod lack of thoroughness, from a man's point of view,
characterized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) transferred allegiance, prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), thus far, incomplete relations with Jude; and Phillotson lay
writhing like a man in hell as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) pictured the prettily dressed,
maddening compound of sympathy and averseness who bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) name,
returning impatiently to the home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lover.

<p/>Gillingham was so interested in Phillotson's affairs, and so
seriously concerned about him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) walked up the hill-side to
Shaston two or three times a week, although, there and back, it was
a journey of nine miles, which had to be performed between tea and
supper, after a hard day's work in school. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) called on the
next occasion after Sue's visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend was downstairs, and
Gillingham noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) restless mood had been supplanted by a
more fixed and composed one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)'s been here since you called last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Mrs. Phillotson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! You have made it up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No... She (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) just came, patted my pillow with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) little white hand,
played the thoughtful nurse for half an hour, and went away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I'm hanged! A little hussy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, what a tantalizing, capricious little woman! If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were
not your wife--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s another man's except in name and law. And I have
been thinking--it was suggested to me by a conversation I had with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--that, in kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), I ought to dissolve the legal tie
altogether; which, singularly enough, I think I can do, now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has
been back, and refused my request to stay after I said I had forgiven
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I believe that fact would afford me opportunity of doing it,
though I did not see it at the moment. What's the use of keeping
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chained on to me if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't belong to me? I know--I feel
absolutely certain--that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would welcome my taking such a step as
the greatest charity to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). For though as a fellow-creature she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
sympathizes with, and pities me, and even weeps for me, as a husband
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot endure me--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loathes me--there's no use in mincing
words--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loathes me, and my only manly, and dignified, and merciful
course is to complete what I have begun... And for worldly reasons,
too, it will be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be independent. I have hopelessly
ruined my prospects because of my decision as to what was best for
us, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not know it; I see only dire poverty ahead from
my feet to the grave; for I can be accepted as teacher no more. I
shall probably have enough to do to make both ends meet during the
remainder of my life, now my occupation's gone; and I shall be
better able to bear it alone. I may as well tell you that what has
suggested my letting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go is some news she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brought me--the news
that Fawley is doing the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had a spouse, too? A queer couple, these lovers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I don't want your opinion on that. What I was going to say is
that my liberating her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can do her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no possible harm, and will open up
a chance of happiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has never dreamt of hitherto.
For then they'll be able to marry, as they ought to have done at
first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Gillingham did not hurry to reply. <div class="bookquote">``I may disagree with your
motive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said gently, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) respected views he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) could not share.
<div class="bookquote">``But I think you are right in your determination--if you can carry it
out. I doubt, however, if you can.''

<p/>I


<p/>How Gillingham's doubts were disposed of will most quickly appear by
passing over the series of dreary months and incidents that followed
the events of the last chapter, and coming on to a Sunday in the
February of the year following.

<p/>Sue and Jude were living in Aldbrickham, in precisely the same
relations that they had established between themselves when she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>)
left Shaston to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) the year before. The proceedings in the
law-courts had reached their consciousness, but as a distant sound
and an occasional missive which they hardly understood.

<p/>They had met, as usual, to breakfast together in the little house
with Jude's name on it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had taken at fifteen pounds a year,
with three-pounds-ten extra for rates and taxes, and furnished with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) aunt's ancient and lumbering goods, which had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) about
their full value to bring all the way from Marygreen. Sue kept
house, and managed everything.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) entered the room this morning Sue held up a letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had just
received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; and what is it about?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said after kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That the decree _nisi_ in the case of Phillotson _versus_ Phillotson
and Fawley, pronounced six months ago, has just been made absolute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sat down.

<p/>The same concluding incident in Jude's suit against Arabella had
occurred about a month or two earlier. Both cases had been too
insignificant to be reported in the papers, further than by name in
a long list of other undefended cases.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, Sue, at any rate, you can do what you like!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) looked at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) sweetheart curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we--you and I--just as free now as if we had never married at
all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as free--except, I believe, that a clergyman may object
personally to remarry you, and hand the job on to somebody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I wonder--do you think it is really so with us? I know it is
generally. But I have an uncomfortable feeling that my freedom has
been obtained under false pretences!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--if the truth about us had been known, the decree wouldn't have
been pronounced. It is only, is it, because we have made no defence,
and have led them into a false supposition? Therefore is my freedom
lawful, however proper it may be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--why did you let it be under false pretences? You have only
yourself to blame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said mischievously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jude--don't! You ought not to be touchy about that still. You must
take me as I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, darling: so I will. Perhaps you were right. As to your
question, we were not obliged to prove anything. That was their
business. Anyhow we are living together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Though not in their sense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One thing is certain, that however the decree may be brought
about, a marriage is dissolved when it is dissolved. There is this
advantage in being poor obscure people like us--that these things are
done for us in a rough and ready fashion. It was the same with me
and Arabella. I was afraid her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) criminal second marriage would have
been discovered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) punished; but nobody took any interest in
her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)--nobody inquired, nobody suspected it. If we'd been patented
nobilities we should have had infinite trouble, and days and weeks
would have been spent in investigations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div><p/>By degrees Sue acquired her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) lover's cheerfulness at the sense of
freedom, and proposed that they should take a walk in the fields,
even if they had to put up with a cold dinner on account of it.
Jude agreed, and Sue went up-stairs and prepared to start, putting
on a joyful coloured gown in observance of her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) liberty; seeing which
Jude put on a lighter tie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we'll strut arm and arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``like any other engaged
couple. We've a legal right to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They rambled out of the town, and along a path over the low-lying
lands that bordered it, though these were frosty now, and the
extensive seed-fields were bare of colour and produce. The pair,
however, were so absorbed in their own situation that their
surroundings were little in their consciousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dearest, the result of all this is that we can marry after
a decent interval.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I suppose we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue, without enthusiasm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And aren't we going to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like to say no, dear Jude; but I feel just the same about
it now as I have done all along. I have just the same dread lest an
iron contract should extinguish your tenderness for me, and mine for
you, as it did between our unfortunate parents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, what can we do? I do love you, as you know, Sue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it abundantly. But I think I would much rather go on living
always as lovers, as we are living now, and only meeting by day. It
is so much sweeter--for the woman at least, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is sure of
the man. And henceforward we needn't be so particular as we have
been about appearances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our experiences of matrimony with others have not been encouraging,
I own,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), with some gloom; <div class="bookquote">``either owing to our own
dissatisfied, unpractical natures, or by our misfortune. But we
two--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should be two dissatisfied ones linked together, which would be
twice as bad as before... I think I should begin to be afraid of
you, Jude, the moment you had contracted to cherish me under a
Government stamp, and I was licensed to be loved on the premises by
you--Ugh, how horrible and sordid! Although, as you are, free, I
trust you more than any other man in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no--don't say I should change!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) expostulated; yet there was
misgiving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own voice also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apart from ourselves, and our unhappy peculiarities, it is foreign
to a man's nature to go on loving a person when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is told that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must and shall be that person's lover. There would be a much
likelier chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doing it if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were told not to love. If the
marriage ceremony consisted in an oath and signed contract between
the parties to cease loving from that day forward, in consideration
of personal possession being given, and to avoid each other's society
as much as possible in public, there would be more loving couples
than there are now. Fancy the secret meetings between the perjuring
husband and wife, the denials of having seen each other, the
clambering in at bedroom windows, and the hiding in closets! There'd
be little cooling then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but admitting this, or something like it, to be true, you are
not the only one in the world to see it, dear little Sue. People go
on marrying because they can't resist natural forces, although many
of them may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a
month's pleasure with a life's discomfort. No doubt my father and
mother, and your father and mother, saw it, if they at all resembled
us in habits of observation. But then they went and married just the
same, because they had ordinary passions. But you, Sue, are such a
phantasmal, bodiless creature, one who--if you'll allow me to say
it--has so little animal passion in you, that you can act upon reason
in the matter, when we poor unfortunate wretches of grosser substance
can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sighed, <div class="bookquote">``you've owned that it would probably end in
misery for us. And I am not so exceptional a woman as you think.
Fewer women like marriage than you suppose, only they enter into it
for the dignity it is assumed to confer, and the social advantages
it gains them sometimes--a dignity and an advantage that I am quite
willing to do without.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude fell back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old complaint--that, intimate as they were,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had never once had from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) an honest, candid declaration that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
loved or could love him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I really fear sometimes that you cannot,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, with a dubiousness approaching anger. <div class="bookquote">``And you are so
reticent. I know that women are taught by other women that they
must never admit the full truth to a man. But the highest form of
affection is based on full sincerity on both sides. Not being men,
these women don't know that in looking back on those he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had
tender relations with, a man's heart returns closest to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) who
was the soul of truth in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) conduct. The better class of man,
even if caught by airy affectations of dodging and parrying, is not
retained by them. A Nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of
elusiveness too often, in the utter contempt for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that, sooner
or later, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old admirers feel; under which they allow her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to go
unlamented to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue, who was regarding the distance, had acquired a guilty look; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) suddenly replied in a tragic voice: <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I like you
to-day so well as I did, Jude!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you? Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well--you are not nice--too sermony. Though I suppose I am so
bad and worthless that I deserve the utmost rigour of lecturing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you are not bad. You are a dear. But as slippery as an eel
when I want to get a confession from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I am bad, and obstinate, and all sorts! It is no use your
pretending I am not! People who are good don't want scolding as I
do... But now that I have nobody but you, and nobody to defend me,
it is very hard that I mustn't have my own way in deciding how I'll
live with you, and whether I'll be married or no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue, my own comrade and sweetheart, I don't want to force you either
to marry or to do the other thing--of course I don't! It is too
wicked of you to be so pettish! Now we won't say any more about it,
and go on just the same as we have done; and during the rest of our
walk we'll talk of the meadows only, and the floods, and the prospect
of the farmers this coming year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for
several days, though living as they were with only a landing between
them it was constantly in their minds. Sue was assisting Jude very
materially now: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had latterly occupied himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own account
in working and lettering headstones, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) kept in a little yard
at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) little house, where in the intervals of domestic
duties she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) marked out the letters full size for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and blacked them
in after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had cut them. It was a lower class of handicraft than
were his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) former performances as a cathedral mason, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) only
patrons were the poor people who lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own neighbourhood,
and knew what a cheap man this <div class="bookquote">``Jude Fawley: Monumental Mason''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man Fawley</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) called himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) front door-RRB- was to employ for the
simple memorials they required for their dead. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed more
independent than before, and it was the only arrangement under which
Sue, who particularly wished to be no burden on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), could render any
assistance.



<p/>II


<p/>It was an evening at the end of the month, and Jude had just returned
home from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not
far off. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) entered, Sue, who had been keeping indoors during
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) absence, laid out supper for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). Contrary to custom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not
speak. Jude had taken up some illustrated paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) perused
till, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face was troubled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you depressed, Sue?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) paused a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I have a message for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Somebody has called?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. A woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Sue's voice quavered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) spoke, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) suddenly
sat down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) preparations, laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lap, and looked
into the fire. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether I did right or not!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
continued. <div class="bookquote">``I said you were not at home, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
wait, I said I thought you might not be able to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you say that, dear? I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted a headstone. Was
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in mourning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't in mourning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't want a headstone; and I
thought you couldn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Sue looked critically and imploringly
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But who was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wouldn't give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name. But I know who she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was--I think I
do! It was Arabella!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven save us! What should Arabella come for? What made you think
it was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can hardly tell. But I know it was! I feel perfectly certain
it was--by the light in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at me. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a
fleshy, coarse woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I should not have called Arabella coarse exactly, except in
speech, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be getting so by this time under the duties of
the public house. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was rather handsome when I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Handsome! But yes!--so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I heard a quiver in your little mouth. Well, waiving that,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why
should she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come troubling us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s married? Have you definite news of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not definite news. But that was why she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked me to release
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and the man both wanted to lead a proper life, as I
understood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh Jude--it was, it WAS Arabella!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>cried Sue, covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``And I am so miserable! It seems such an ill omen,
whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may have come for. You could not possibly see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
could you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't really think I could. It would be so very painful to talk
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now--for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as much as for me. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s gone. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would come again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went away very reluctantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue, whom the least thing upset, could not eat any supper, and when
Jude had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) prepared to go to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had no sooner
raked out the fire, fastened the doors, and got to the top of the
stairs than there came a knock. Sue instantly emerged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) room,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had but just entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is again!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sue whispered in appalled accents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knocked like that last time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They listened, and the knocking came again. No servant was kept in
the house, and if the summons were to be responded to one of them
would have to do it in person. <div class="bookquote">``I'll open a window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.
<div class="bookquote">``Whoever it is cannot be expected to be let in at this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) accordingly went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) bedroom and lifted the sash. The lonely
street of early retiring workpeople was empty from end to end save of
one figure--that of a woman walking up and down by the lamp a few
yards off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that Mr. Fawley?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>came up from the woman, in a voice which was
unmistakably Arabella's.

<p/>Jude replied that it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>asked Sue from the door, with lips apart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want, Arabella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Jude, for disturbing you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella humbly.
<div class="bookquote">``But I called earlier--I wanted particularly to see you to-night, if
I could. I am in trouble, and have nobody to help me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In trouble, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a silence. An inconvenient sympathy seemed to be rising in
Jude's breast at the appeal. <div class="bookquote">``But aren't you married?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/>Arabella hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``No, Jude, I am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
wouldn't, after all. And I am in great difficulty. I hope to get
another situation as barmaid soon. But it takes time, and I really
am in great distress because of a sudden responsibility that's been
sprung upon me from Australia; or I wouldn't trouble you--believe me
I wouldn't. I want to tell you about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue remained at gaze, in painful tension, hearing every word, but
speaking none.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not really in want of money, Arabella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) asked, in a
distinctly softened tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have enough to pay for the night's lodging I have obtained, but
barely enough to take me back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In London still.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was about to give the address, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid somebody may hear, so I don't like to call out
particulars of myself so loud. If you could come down and walk
a little way with me towards the Prince Inn, where I am staying
to-night, I would explain all. You may as well, for old time's
sake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor thing! I must do her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) the kindness of hearing what's the
matter, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude in much perplexity. <div class="bookquote">``As she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s going
back to-morrow it can't make much difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to-morrow, Jude! Don't go now, Jude!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came in plaintive accents from the doorway. ``Oh, it is only to
entrap you, I know it is, as she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) did before! Don't go, dear! She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is
such a low-passioned woman--I can see it in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shape, and hear it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) voice!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``Don't attempt to detain me, Sue. God
knows I love her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) little enough now, but I don't want to be cruel to
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned to the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s not your wife!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>cried Sue distractedly. <div class="bookquote">``And I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are not either, dear, yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but are you going to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)? Don't! Stay at home! Please, please
stay at home, Jude, and not go to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), now she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s not your wife any
more than I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is, rather more than you, come to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, taking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hat determinedly. <div class="bookquote">``I've wanted you to be, and I've waited with
the patience of Job, and I don't see that I've got anything by my
self-denial. I shall certainly give her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) something, and hear what it
is she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is so anxious to tell me; no man could do less!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) manner which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knew it would be futile to
oppose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said no more, but, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) room as meekly as a
martyr, heard him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) go downstairs, unbolt the door, and close it
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>). With a woman's disregard of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dignity when in the
presence of nobody but herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) also trotted down, sobbing
articulately as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) listened. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew exactly how far
it was to the inn that Arabella had named as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lodging. It would
occupy about seven minutes to get there at an ordinary walking pace;
seven to come back again. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) did not return in fourteen minutes
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) would have lingered. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at the clock. It was twenty-five
minutes to eleven. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) MIGHT enter the inn with Arabella, as they
would reach it before closing time; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might get him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) to drink with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and Heaven only knew what disasters would befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) then.

<p/>In a still suspense she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waited on. It seemed as if the whole time
had nearly elapsed when the door was opened again, and Jude appeared.

<p/>Sue gave a little ecstatic cry. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I knew I could trust you!--how
good you are!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't find her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) anywhere in this street, and I went out in my
slippers only. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has walked on, thinking I've been so hard-hearted
as to refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) requests entirely, poor woman. I've come back for
my boots, as it is beginning to rain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served
you so badly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue in a jealous burst of disappointment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Sue, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a woman, and I once cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and one can't be
a brute in such circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) isn't your wife any longer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sue, passionately
excited. ``You MUSTN``T go out to find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! It isn't right! You
CAN<div class="bookquote">``T join her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a stranger to you. How can you forget such
a thing, my dear, dear one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seems much the same as ever--an erring, careless, unreflecting
fellow-creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, continuing to pull on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) boots. <div class="bookquote">``What
those legal fellows have been playing at in London makes no
difference in my real relations to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was my wife while

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't! That's just what I hold! There's the absurdity!--
Well--you'll come straight back, after a few minutes, won't you,

was always!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I am coarse too, worse luck! I have the germs of every
human infirmity in me, I verily believe--that was why I saw it was
so preposterous of me to think of being a curate. I have cured
myself of drunkenness I think; but I never know in what new form a
suppressed vice will break out in me! I do love you, Sue, though I
have danced attendance on you so long for such poor returns! All
that's best and noblest in me loves you, and your freedom from
everything that's gross has elevated me, and enabled me to do what
I should never have dreamt myself capable of, or any man, a year
or two ago. It is all very well to preach about self-control, and
the wickedness of coercing a woman. But I should just like a few
virtuous people who have condemned me in the past, about Arabella
and other things, to have been in my tantalizing position with
you through these late weeks!--they'd believe, I think, that I
have exercised some little restraint in always giving in to your
wishes--living here in one house, and not a soul between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have been good to me, Jude; I know you have, my dear
protector.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--Arabella has appealed to me for help. I must go out and speak
to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), Sue, at least!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say any more!--Oh, if you must, you must!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said,
bursting out into sobs that seemed to tear her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``I have
nobody but you, Jude, and you are deserting me! I didn't know you
were like this--I can't bear it, I can't! If she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) were yours it
would be different!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or if you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well then--if I must I must. Since you will have it so, I
agree! I will be. Only I didn't mean to! And I didn't want to
marry again, either! ... But, yes--I agree, I agree! I do love you.
I ought to have known that you would conquer in the long run, living
like this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) ran across and flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``I am not a
cold-natured, sexless creature, am I, for keeping you at such a
distance? I am sure you don't think so! Wait and see! I do belong
to you, don't I? I give in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll arrange for our marriage to-morrow, or as soon as ever you
wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Jude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), embracing Sue softly. <div class="bookquote">``I do feel
that it would be unfair to you to see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and perhaps unfair to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is not like you, my darling, and never was: it is only bare
justice to say that. Don't cry any more. There; and there; and
there!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) on one side, and on the other, and in the
middle, and rebolted the front door.



<p/>The next morning it was wet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude gaily at breakfast; <div class="bookquote">``as this is Saturday
I mean to call about the banns at once, so as to get the first
publishing done to-morrow, or we shall lose a week. Banns will do?
We shall save a pound or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue absently agreed to banns. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) mind for the moment was
running on something else. A glow had passed away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and
depression sat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) features.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel I was wickedly selfish last night!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``It was
sheer unkindness in me--or worse--to treat Arabella as I did. I
didn't care about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) being in trouble, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wished to tell
you! Perhaps it was really something she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was justified in telling
you. That's some more of my badness, I suppose! Love has its own
dark morality when rivalry enters in--at least, mine has, if other
people's hasn't... I wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got on? I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reached the
inn all right, poor woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got on all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude placidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wasn't shut out, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hadn't to walk the streets
in the rain. Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to
see if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got in? I've been thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) all the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--is it necessary? You haven't the least idea how Arabella is
able to shift for herself. Still, darling, if you want to go and
inquire you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no limit to the strange and unnecessary penances which Sue
would meekly undertake when in a contrite mood; and this going to
see all sorts of extraordinary persons whose relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
precisely of a kind that would have made other people shun them was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) instinct ever, so that the request did not surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when you come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I'll be ready to go about the
banns. You'll come with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue agreed, and went off under cloak and umbrella letting Jude kiss
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) freely, and returning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) kisses in a way she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had never done
before. Times had decidedly changed. <div class="bookquote">``The little bird is caught at
last!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, a sadness showing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--only nested,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) walked along the muddy street till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) reached the public house
mentioned by Arabella, which was not so very far off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
informed that Arabella had not yet left, and in doubt how to announce
herself so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) predecessor in Jude's affections would recognize
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sent up word that a friend from Spring Street had called,
naming the place of Jude's residence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was asked to step
upstairs, and on being shown into a room found that it was Arabella's
bedroom, and that the latter had not yet risen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) halted on the
turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) toe till Arabella cried from the bed, <div class="bookquote">``Come in and shut
the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>which Sue accordingly did.

<p/>Arabella lay facing the window, and did not at once turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head:
and Sue was wicked enough, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) penitence, to wish for a
moment that Jude could behold her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) forerunner now, with the daylight
full upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) may have seemed handsome enough in profile under
the lamps, but a frowsiness was apparent this morning; and the sight
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own fresh charms in the looking-glass made Sue's manner
bright, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) reflected what a meanly sexual emotion this was in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and hated herself for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just looked in to see if you got back comfortably last night,
that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said gently. <div class="bookquote">``I was afraid afterwards that you
might have met with any mishap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--how stupid this is! I thought my visitor was--your friend--your
husband--Mrs. Fawley, as I suppose you call yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella,
flinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head back upon the pillows with a disappointed toss, and
ceasing to retain the dimple she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had just taken the trouble to
produce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I thought you might have, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s not really yours.
Decency is decency, any hour of the twenty-four.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue stiffly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is mine, if you
come to that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wasn't yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue coloured roseate, and said, <div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From your manner when you talked to me at the door. Well, my dear,
you've been quick about it, and I expect my visit last night helped
it on--ha-ha! But I don't want to get him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) away from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue looked out at the rain, and at the dirty toilet-cover, and at the
detached tail of Arabella's hair hanging on the looking-glass, just
as it had done in Jude's time; and wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had not come. In the
pause there was a knock at the door, and the chambermaid brought in a
telegram for <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Cartlett.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chambermaid</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella opened it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lay, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) ruffled look disappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you for your anxiety about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said
blandly when the maid had gone; <div class="bookquote">``but it is not necessary you should
feel it. My man finds he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't do without me after all, and agrees
to stand by the promise to marry again over here that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has made me
all along. See here! This is in answer to one from me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) held
out the telegram for Sue to read, but Sue did not take it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks
me to come back. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little corner public in Lambeth would go to
pieces without me, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isn't going to knock me about
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had a drop, any more after we are spliced by English law
than before! ... As for you, I should coax Jude to take me before
the parson straight off, and have done with it, if I were in your
place. I say it as a friend, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s waiting to, any day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>returned Sue, with frigid pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), in Heaven's name. Life with a man is more
businesslike after it, and money matters work better. And then, you
see, if you have rows, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turns you out of doors, you can get the
law to protect you, which you can't otherwise, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) half-runs
you through with a knife, or cracks your noddle with a poker. And
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bolts away from you--I say it friendly, as woman to woman, for
there's never any knowing what a man med do--you'll have the sticks
o' furniture, and won't be looked upon as a thief. I shall marry my
man over again, now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s willing, as there was a little flaw in the
first ceremony. In my telegram last night which this is an answer
to, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I had almost made it up with Jude; and that frightened
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), I expect! Perhaps I should quite have done it if it hadn't been
for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said laughing; <div class="bookquote">``and then how different our histories
might have been from to-day! Never such a tender fool as Jude is if
a woman seems in trouble, and coaxes him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) a bit! Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) used to
be about birds and things. However, as it happens, it is just as
well as if I had made it up, and I forgive you. And, as I say, I'd
advise you to get the business legally done as soon as possible.
You'll find it an awful bother later on if you don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) is asking me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)--to make our natural
marriage a legal one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue, with yet more dignity. <div class="bookquote">``It was
quite by my wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) didn't the moment I was free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes--you are a oneyer too, like myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella, eyeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) visitor with humorous criticism. <div class="bookquote">``Bolted from your first, didn't
you, like me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning!--I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I, too, must up and off!''  (<font color='red'><b>person</b></font>)</div>replied the other, springing out of
bed so suddenly that the soft parts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) person shook. Sue jumped
aside in trepidation. <div class="bookquote">``Lord, I am only a woman--not a six-foot
sojer! ... Just a moment, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) continued, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand on
Sue's arm. <div class="bookquote">``I really did want to consult Jude on a little matter of
business, as I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). I came about that more than anything else.
Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) run up to speak to me at the station as I am going? You
think not. Well, I'll write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) about it. I didn't want to write
it, but never mind--I will.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>III


<p/>When Sue reached home Jude was awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) at the door to take the
initial step towards their marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm, and they
went along silently together, as true comrades oft-times do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was preoccupied, and forbore to question her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh Jude--I've been talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I
hadn't! And yet it is best to be reminded of things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was civil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I--I can't help liking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)--just a little bit! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)'s not
an ungenerous nature; and I am so glad her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) difficulties have all
suddenly ended.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) explained how Arabella had been summoned back,
and would be enabled to retrieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) position. <div class="bookquote">``I was referring
to our old question. What Arabella has been saying to me has made
me feel more than ever how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal
marriage is--a sort of trap to catch a man--I can't bear to think
of it. I wish I hadn't promised to let you put up the banns this
morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't mind me. Any time will do for me. I thought you might
like to get it over quickly, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I don't feel any more anxious now than I did before.
Perhaps with any other man I might be a little anxious; but among the
very few virtues possessed by your family and mine, dear, I think I
may set staunchness. So I am not a bit frightened about losing you,
now I really am yours and you really are mine. In fact, I am easier
in my mind than I was, for my conscience is clear about Richard, who
now has a right to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) freedom. I felt we were deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue, you seem when you are like this to be one of the women of some
grand old civilization, whom I used to read about in my bygone,
wasted, classical days, rather than a denizen of a mere Christian
country. I almost expect you to say at these times that you have
just been talking to some friend whom you met in the Via Sacra,
about the latest news of Octavia or Livia; or have been listening to
Aspasia's eloquence, or have been watching Praxiteles chiselling away
at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) latest Venus, while Phryne made complaint that she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) was tired
of posing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parish clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>They had now reached the house of the parish clerk. Sue stood back,
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lover went up to the door. His (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hand was raised to knock
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Jude!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) looked round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute, would you mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just let us think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said timidly. <div class="bookquote">``I had such a horrid dream
one night! ... And Arabella--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Arabella say to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) said that when people were tied up you could get
the law of a man better if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beat you--and how when couples
quarrelled... Jude, do you think that when you must have me with
you by law, we shall be so happy as we are now? The men and women
of our family are very generous when everything depends upon their
goodwill, but they always kick against compulsion. Don't you
dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation?
Don't you think it is destructive to a passion whose essence is its
gratuitousness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, love, you are beginning to frighten me, too, with all
this foreboding! Well, let's go back and think it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face brightened. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--so we will!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). And they turned
from the clerk's door, Sue taking his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arm and murmuring as they
walked on homeward:


<p/>Can you keep the bee from ranging,
Or the ring-dove's neck from changing?
No! Nor fetter'd love ...


<p/>They thought it over, or postponed thinking. Certainly they
postponed action, and seemed to live on in a dreamy paradise.
At the end of a fortnight or three weeks matters remained unadvanced,
and no banns were announced to the ears of any Aldbrickham
congregation.

<p/>Whilst they were postponing and postponing thus a letter and a
newspaper arrived before breakfast one morning from Arabella.
Seeing the handwriting Jude went up to Sue's room and told her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>),
and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was dressed she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hastened down. Sue opened the
newspaper; Jude the letter. After glancing at the paper she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) held
across the first page to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) finger on a paragraph; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
was so absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) letter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not turn awhile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked and read. The paper was one that circulated in South
London only, and the marked advertisement was simply the announcement
of a marriage at St. John's Church, Waterloo Road, under the names,
<div class="bookquote">``CARTLETT--DONN'' (<font color='red'><b>St. John</b></font>)</div>; the united pair being Arabella and the inn-keeper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is satisfactory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue complacently. <div class="bookquote">``Though, after
this, it seems rather low to do likewise, and I am glad. However,
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is provided for now in a way, I suppose, whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) faults,
poor thing. It is nicer that we are able to think that, than to be
uneasy about her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). I ought, too, to write to Richard and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) how
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is getting on, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>But Jude's attention was still absorbed. Having merely glanced
at the announcement he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said in a disturbed voice: <div class="bookquote">``Listen to this
letter. What shall I say or do?''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>THE THREE HORNS, LAMBETH.

<p/>DEAR JUDE -LRB-I won't be so distant as to call you Mr.
Fawley-RRB-,--I send to-day a newspaper, from which useful
document you will learn that I was married over again to
Cartlett last Tuesday. So that business is settled right
and tight at last. But what I write about more particular
is that private affair I wanted to speak to you on when I
came down to Aldbrickham. I couldn't very well tell it to
your lady friend, and should much have liked to let you
know it by word of mouth, as I could have explained better
than by letter. The fact is, Jude, that, though I have
never informed you before, there was a boy born of our
marriage, eight months after I left you, when I was at
Sydney, living with my father and mother. All that is
easily provable. As I had separated from you before I
thought such a thing was going to happen, and I was over
there, and our quarrel had been sharp, I did not think it
convenient to write about the birth. I was then looking
out for a good situation, so my parents took the child,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been with them ever since. That was why I did
not mention it when I met you in Christminster, nor at
the law proceedings. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is now of an intelligent age, of
course, and my mother and father have lately written to
say that, as they have rather a hard struggle over there,
and I am settled comfortably here, they don't see why
they should be encumbered with the child any longer, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
parents being alive. I would have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with me here in
a moment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not old enough to be of any use in
the bar nor will be for years and years, and naturally
Cartlett might think him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the way. They have, however,
packed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) off to me in charge of some friends who
happened to be coming home, and I must ask you to take
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arrives, for I don't know what to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is lawfully yours, that I solemnly swear. If anybody
says he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) isn't, call them brimstone liars, for my sake.
Whatever I may have done before or afterwards, I was
honest to you from the time we were married till I went
away, and I remain, yours, &c.,

<p/>ARABELLA CARTLETT.


<p/>Sue's look was one of dismay. <div class="bookquote">``What will you do, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked
faintly.

<p/>Jude did not reply, and Sue watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) anxiously, with heavy
breaths.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It hits me hard!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in an under-voice. <div class="bookquote">``It MAY be true!
I can't make it out. Certainly, if his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) birth was exactly when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) says, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s mine. I cannot think why she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) didn't tell me when
I met her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) at Christminster, and came on here that evening with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)! ... Ah--I do remember now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) said something about having
a thing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would like me to know, if ever we lived
together again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor child seems to be wanted by nobody!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sue replied, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
eyes filled.

<p/>Jude had by this time come to himself. <div class="bookquote">``What a view of life he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
must have, mine or not mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I must say that, if I were
better off, I should not stop for a moment to think whose he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might
be. I would take him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) up. The beggarly question of
parentage--what is it, after all? What does it matter, when you come
to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not? All the
little ones of our time are collectively the children of us adults of
the time, and entitled to our general care. That excessive regard of
parents for their own children, and their dislike of other people's,
is, like class-feeling, patriotism, save-your-own-soul-ism, and other
virtues, a mean exclusiveness at bottom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue jumped up and kissed Jude with passionate devotion. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--so
it is, dearest! And we'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) here! And if he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) isn't yours it
makes it all the better. I do hope he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) isn't--though perhaps I ought
not to feel quite that! If he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) isn't, I should like so much for us
to have him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) as an adopted child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you must assume about him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) what is most pleasing to you, my
curious little comrade!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. ``I feel that, anyhow, I don't like
to leave the unfortunate little fellow to neglect. Just think of
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) life in a Lambeth pothouse, and all its evil influences, with a
parent who doesn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and has, indeed, hardly seen him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and
a stepfather who doesn't know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). ``Let the day perish wherein I
was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child
conceived!<div class="bookquote">'' That's what the boy--MY boy, perhaps, will find himself
saying before long!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I was the petitioner, I am really entitled to his (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>) custody, I
suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether or no, we must have him (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>). I see that. I'll do the best I
can to be a mother to him (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>), and we can afford to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>) somehow.
I'll work harder. I wonder when he (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>)'ll arrive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the course of a few weeks, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish--When shall we have courage to marry, Jude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever you have it, I think I shall. It remains with you
entirely, dear. Only say the word, and it's done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Before the boy comes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would make a more natural home for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>Jude thereupon wrote in purely formal terms to request that the boy
should be sent on to them as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arrived, making no remark
whatever on the surprising nature of Arabella's information, nor
vouchsafing a single word of opinion on the boy's paternity, nor on
whether, had he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) known all this, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) conduct towards her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) would have
been quite the same.

<p/>In the down-train that was timed to reach Aldbrickham station about
ten o'clock the next evening, a small, pale child's face could
be seen in the gloom of a third-class carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had large,
frightened eyes, and wore a white woollen cravat, over which a
key was suspended round his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neck by a piece of common string: the
key attracting attention by its occasional shine in the lamplight.
In the band of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) half-ticket was stuck. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes
remained mostly fixed on the back of the seat opposite, and never
turned to the window even when a station was reached and called.
On the other seat were two or three passengers, one of them a working
woman who held a basket on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap, in which was a tabby kitten.
The woman opened the cover now and then, whereupon the kitten would
put out its head, and indulge in playful antics. At these the
fellow-passengers laughed, except the solitary boy bearing the key
and ticket, who, regarding the kitten with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saucer eyes, seemed
mutely to say: <div class="bookquote">``All laughing comes from misapprehension. Rightly
looked at, there is no laughable thing under the sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the kitten</b></font>)</div><p/>Occasionally, at a stoppage, the guard would look into the compartment
and say to the boy, <div class="bookquote">``All right, my man. Your box is safe in the
van.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>The boy would say, <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>without animation, would try to
smile, and fail.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was Age masquerading as Juvenility, and doing it so badly that
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) real self showed through crevices. A ground-swell from ancient
years of night seemed now and then to lift the child in this his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
morning-life, when his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face took a back view over some great Atlantic
of Time, and appeared not to care about what it saw.

<p/>When the other travellers closed their eyes, which they did one by
one--even the kitten curling itself up in the basket, weary of its
too circumscribed play--the boy remained just as before. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) then
seemed to be doubly awake, like an enslaved and dwarfed divinity,
sitting passive and regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) companions as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw their whole
rounded lives rather than their immediate figures.

<p/>This was Arabella's boy. With her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) usual carelessness, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had
postponed writing to Jude about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) till the eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) landing,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could absolutely postpone no longer, though she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had known
for weeks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) approaching arrival, and had, as she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) truly said,
visited Aldbrickham mainly to reveal the boy's existence and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) near
home-coming to Jude. This very day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had received her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
former husband's answer at some time in the afternoon, the child
reached the London Docks, and the family in whose charge he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come,
having put him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) into a cab for Lambeth and directed the cabman to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
mother's house, bade him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) good-bye, and went their way.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arrival at the Three Horns, Arabella had looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) over with
an expression that was as good as saying, <div class="bookquote">``You are very much what I
expected you to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) a good meal, a little money, and,
late as it was getting, dispatched him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) to Jude by the next train,
wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband Cartlett, who was out, not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>The train reached Aldbrickham, and the boy was deposited on the
lonely platform beside his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) box. The collector took his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ticket, and,
with a meditative sense of the unfitness of things, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) where
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going by himself at that time of night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to Spring Street,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the little one impassively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that's a long way from here; a`most out in the country; and the
folks will be gone to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got to go there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have a fly for your box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I must walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well: you'd better leave your box here and send for it. There's
a `bus goes half-way, but you'll have to walk the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't your friends come to meet `ee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose they didn't know I was coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is your friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother didn't wish me to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All I can do, then, is to take charge of this. Now walk as fast as
you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Saying nothing further the boy came out into the street, looking
round to see that nobody followed or observed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
had walked some little distance he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked for the street of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
destination. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was told to go straight on quite into the outskirts
of the place.

<p/>The child fell into a steady mechanical creep which had in it an
impersonal quality--the movement of the wave, or of the breeze, or
of the cloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) followed his (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) directions literally, without an
inquiring gaze at anything. It could have been seen that the boy's
ideas of life were different from those of the local boys. Children
begin with detail, and learn up to the general; they begin with the
contiguous, and gradually comprehend the universal. The boy seemed
to have begun with the generals of life, and never to have concerned
himself with the particulars. To him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the houses, the willows,
the obscure fields beyond, were apparently regarded not as brick
residences, pollards, meadows; but as human dwellings in the
abstract, vegetation, and the wide dark world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) found the way to the little lane, and knocked at the door of
Jude's house. Jude had just retired to bed, and Sue was about to
enter her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) chamber adjoining when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) heard the knock and came down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this where Father lives?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>asked the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fawley, that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue ran up to Jude's room and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hurried down as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could, though to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) impatience he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--is it he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)--so soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) asked as Jude came.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) scrutinized the child's features, and suddenly went away into the
little sitting-room adjoining. Jude lifted the boy to a level with
himself, keenly regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with gloomy tenderness, and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would have been met if they had known of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) coming so soon, set
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) provisionally in a chair whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went to look for Sue, whose
supersensitiveness was disturbed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in the
dark, bending over an arm-chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) enclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm, and
putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face by hers, whispered, <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What Arabella says is true--true! I see you in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well: that's one thing in my life as it should be, at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the other half of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) is--SHE! And that's what I can't bear!
But I ought to--I'll try to get used to it; yes, I ought!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jealous little Sue! I withdraw all remarks about your sexlessness.
Never mind! Time may right things... And Sue, darling; I have an
idea! We'll educate and train him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) with a view to the university.
What I couldn't accomplish in my own person perhaps I can carry out
through him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)? They are making it easier for poor students now, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh you dreamer!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand returned to the
child with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). The boy looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Is it you who's my REAL mother at last?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? Do I look like your father's wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; `cept he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seems fond of you, and you of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Can I call
you Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>Then a yearning look came over the child and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to cry. Sue
thereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise, being a
harp which the least wind of emotion from another's heart could make
to vibrate as readily as a radical stir in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may call me Mother, if you wish to, my poor dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said,
bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this round your neck?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>asked Jude with affected calmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The key of my box that's at the station.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They bustled about and got him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) some supper, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) up a
temporary bed, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) soon fell asleep. Both went and looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) called you Mother two or three times before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dropped off,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>murmured Jude. <div class="bookquote">``Wasn't it odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should have wanted to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--it was significant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue. <div class="bookquote">``There's more for us to think
about in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the
sky... I suppose, dear, we must pluck up courage, and get that
ceremony over? It is no use struggling against the current, and I
feel myself getting intertwined with my kind. Oh Jude, you'll love
me dearly, won't you, afterwards? I do want to be kind to this
child, and to be a mother to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>); and our adding the legal form to
our marriage might make it easier for me.''



 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>IV


<p/>Their next and second attempt thereat was more deliberately made,
though it was begun on the morning following the singular child's
arrival at their home.

<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) they found to be in the habit of sitting silent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) quaint and
weird face set, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes resting on things they did not see in
the substantial world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face is like the tragic mask of Melpomene,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue. <div class="bookquote">``What is
your name, dear? Did you tell us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Little Father Time is what they always called me. It is a nickname;
because I look so aged, they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you talk so, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``It is strange, Jude,
that these preternaturally old boys almost always come from new
countries. But what were you christened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, if I died in damnation, `twould save the expense of a
Christian funeral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--your name is not Jude, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) father with some
disappointment.

<p/>The boy shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Never heerd on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue quickly; <div class="bookquote">``since she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was hating you all the
time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) christened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude; and privately to Sue: <div class="bookquote">``The
day we are married.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Yet the advent of the child disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>Their position lent them shyness, and having an impression that a
marriage at a superintendent registrar's office was more private than
an ecclesiastical one, they decided to avoid a church this time.
Both Sue and Jude together went to the office of the district to give
notice: they had become such companions that they could hardly do
anything of importance except in each other's company.

<p/>Jude Fawley signed the form of notice, Sue looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) shoulder
and watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) hand as it traced the words. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) read the
four-square undertaking, never before seen by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), into which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own and Jude's names were inserted, and by which that very
volatile essence, their love for each other, was supposed to be
made permanent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face seemed to grow painfully apprehensive.
<div class="bookquote">``Names and Surnames of the Parties'' (<font color='red'><b>parties lovers</b></font>)</div>---LRB-they were to be parties now,
not lovers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) thought-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Condition'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>---LRB-a horrid idea-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``Rank or

County in which the Parties respectively dwell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It spoils the sentiment, doesn't it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said on their way home.
<div class="bookquote">``It seems making a more sordid business of it even than signing the
contract in a vestry. There is a little poetry in a church. But
we'll try to get through with it, dearest, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``We will. ``For what man is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that hath betrothed a wife and hath
not taken her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go and return unto his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
die in the battle, and another man take her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">'' So said the Jewish
law-giver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How you know the Scriptures, Jude! You really ought to have been a
parson. I can only quote profane writers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>During the interval before the issuing of the certificate, Sue, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
housekeeping errands, sometimes walked past the office, and furtively
glancing in saw affixed to the wall the notice of the purposed clinch
to their union. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could not bear its aspect. Coming after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
previous experience of matrimony, all the romance of their attachment
seemed to be starved away by placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) present case in the same
category. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was usually leading little Father Time by the hand,
and fancied that people thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hers, and regarded the intended
ceremony as the patching up of an old error.

<p/>Meanwhile Jude decided to link his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) present with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) past in some
slight degree by inviting to the wedding the only person remaining on
earth who was associated with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) early life at Marygreen--the aged
widow Mrs. Edlin, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) great-aunt's friend and nurse in
her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) last illness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hardly expected that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would come; but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
did, bringing singular presents, in the form of apples, jam, brass
snuffers, an ancient pewter dish, a warming-pan, and an enormous bag
of goose feathers towards a bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was allotted the spare room in
Jude's house, whither she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) retired early, and where they could hear
her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) through the ceiling below, honestly saying the Lord's Prayer in
a loud voice, as the Rubric directed.

<p/>As, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could not sleep, and discovered that Sue and Jude
were still sitting up--it being in fact only ten o'clock--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) dressed
herself again and came down, and they all sat by the fire till a late
hour--Father Time included; though, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) never spoke, they were
hardly conscious of him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I bain't set against marrying as your great-aunt was,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said
the widow. <div class="bookquote">``And I hope `twill be a jocund wedding for ye in all
respects this time. Nobody can hope it more, knowing what I do
of your families, which is more, I suppose, than anybody else now
living. For they have been unlucky that way, God knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue breathed uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They was always good-hearted people, too--wouldn't kill a fly if
they knowed it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wedding guest</b></font>)</div>continued the wedding guest. <div class="bookquote">``But things happened
to thwart 'em, and if everything wasn't vitty they were upset. No
doubt that's how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that the tale is told of came to do what 'a
did--if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) WERE one of your family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--that tale, ye know; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that was gibbeted just on the brow of
the hill by the Brown House--not far from the milestone between
Marygreen and Alfredston, where the other road branches off. But
Lord, 'twas in my grandfather's time; and it medn' have been one of
your folk at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know where the gibbet is said to have stood, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>murmured
Jude. <div class="bookquote">``But I never heard of this. What--did this man--my ancestor
and Sue's--kill his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Twer not that exactly. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) ran away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), with their child,
to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) friends; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was there the child died. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wanted
the body, to bury it where his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) people lay, but she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) wouldn't give it
up. Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) husband then came in the night with a cart, and broke into
the house to steal the coffin away; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was catched, and being
obstinate, wouldn't tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) broke in for. They brought it in
burglary, and that's why he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was hanged and gibbeted on Brown House
Hill. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife went mad after he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was dead. But it medn't be true
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) belonged to ye more than to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside, as if out of
the earth: <div class="bookquote">``If I was you, Mother, I wouldn't marry Father!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It came
from little Time, and they started, for they had forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it is only a tale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue cheeringly.

<p/>After this exhilarating tradition from the widow on the eve of
the solemnization they rose, and, wishing their guest good-night,
retired.

<p/>The next morning Sue, whose nervousness intensified with the
hours, took Jude privately into the sitting-room before starting.
<div class="bookquote">``Jude, I want you to kiss me, as a lover, incorporeally,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said,
tremulously nestling up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), with damp lashes. <div class="bookquote">``It won't be ever
like this any more, will it? I wish we hadn't begun the business.
But I suppose we must go on. How horrid that story was last night!
It spoilt my thoughts of to-day. It makes me feel as if a tragic doom
overhung our family, as it did the house of Atreus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or the house of Jeroboam,''  (<font color='red'><b>the theologian</b></font>)</div>said the quondam theologian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And it seems awful temerity in us two to go marrying! I am
going to vow to you in the same words I vowed in to my other husband,
and you to me in the same as you used to your other wife; regardless
of the deterrent lesson we were taught by those experiments!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are uneasy I am made unhappy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>theologian</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I had hoped you
would feel quite joyful. But if you don't, you don't. It is no use
pretending. It is a dismal business to you, and that makes it so to
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is unpleasantly like that other morning--that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Let us go on now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the office aforesaid</b></font>)</div><p/>They started arm in arm for the office aforesaid, no witness
accompanying them except the Widow Edlin. The day was chilly and
dull, and a clammy fog blew through the town from <div class="bookquote">``Royal-tower'd
Thame.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>On the steps of the office there were the muddy foot-marks
of people who had entered, and in the entry were damp umbrellas.
Within the office several persons were gathered, and our couple
perceived that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was
just in progress. Sue, Jude, and the widow stood in the background
while this was going on, Sue reading the notices of marriage on the
wall. The room was a dreary place to two of their temperament,
though to its usual frequenters it doubtless seemed ordinary enough.
Law-books in musty calf covered one wall, and elsewhere were
post-office directories, and other books of reference. Papers in
packets tied with red tape were pigeon-holed around, and some iron
safes filled a recess, while the bare wood floor was, like the
door-step, stained by previous visitors.

<p/>The soldier was sullen and reluctant: the bride sad and timid; she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
was soon, obviously, to become a mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a black eye.
Their little business was soon done, and the twain and their friends
straggled out, one of the witnesses saying casually to Jude and Sue
in passing, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had known them before: <div class="bookquote">``See the couple just
come in? Ha, ha! That fellow is just out of gaol this morning.
She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at the gaol gates, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) straight here. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s
paying for everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue turned her (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) head and saw an ill-favoured man, closely cropped,
with a broad-faced, pock-marked woman on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, ruddy with liquor
and the satisfaction of being on the brink of a gratified desire.
They jocosely saluted the outgoing couple, and went forward in front
of Jude and Sue, whose diffidence was increasing. The latter drew
back and turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lover, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) mouth shaping itself like that of
a child about to give way to grief:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jude--I don't like it here! I wish we hadn't come! The place gives
me the horrors: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love!
I wish it had been at church, if it had to be at all. It is not so
vulgar there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``How troubled and pale you look!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be performed here now, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--perhaps not necessarily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) spoke to the clerk, and came back. <div class="bookquote">``No--we need not marry here or
anywhere, unless we like, even now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We can be married in
a church, if not with the same certificate with another he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'ll give
us, I think. Anyhow, let us go out till you are calmer, dear, and I
too, and talk it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/>They went out stealthily and guiltily, as if they had committed a
misdemeanour, closing the door without noise, and telling the widow,
who had remained in the entry, to go home and await them; that they
would call in any casual passers as witnesses, if necessary. When
in the street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they
walked up and down as they had done long ago in the market-house at
Melchester.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, darling, what shall we do? We are making a mess of it, it
strikes me. Still, ANYTHING that pleases you will please me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Jude, dearest, I am worrying you! You wanted it to be there,
didn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to tell the truth, when I got inside I felt as if I didn't
care much about it. The place depressed me almost as much as it
did you--it was ugly. And then I thought of what you had said this
morning as to whether we ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked on vaguely, till she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) paused, and her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) little voice began
anew: <div class="bookquote">``It seems so weak, too, to vacillate like this! And yet how
much better than to act rashly a second time... How terrible that
scene was to me! The expression in that flabby woman's face, leading
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on to give herself to that gaol-bird, not for a few hours, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would, but for a lifetime, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must. And the other poor soul--to
escape a nominal shame which was owing to the weakness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
character, degrading herself to the real shame of bondage to a tyrant
who scorned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--a man whom to avoid for ever was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only chance of
salvation... This is our parish church, isn't it? This is where
it would have to be, if we did it in the usual way? A service or
something seems to be going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude went up and looked in at the door. <div class="bookquote">``Why--it is a wedding here
too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody seems to be on our tack to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue said she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) supposed it was because Lent was just over, when there
was always a crowd of marriages. <div class="bookquote">``Let us listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and
find how it feels to us when performed in a church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They stepped in, and entered a back seat, and watched the proceedings
at the altar. The contracting couple appeared to belong to the
well-to-do middle class, and the wedding altogether was of ordinary
prettiness and interest. They could see the flowers tremble in the
bride's hand, even at that distance, and could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mechanical
murmur of words whose meaning her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) brain seemed to gather not at all
under the pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) self-consciousness. Sue and Jude listened,
and severally saw themselves in time past going through the same form
of self-committal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not the same to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), poor thing, as it would be to me doing it
over again with my present knowledge,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sue whispered. <div class="bookquote">``You see, they
are fresh to it, and take the proceedings as a matter of course.
But having been awakened to its awful solemnity as we have, or at
least as I have, by experience, and to my own too squeamish feelings
perhaps sometimes, it really does seem immoral in me to go and
undertake the same thing again with open eyes. Coming in here and
seeing this has frightened me from a church wedding as much as the
other did from a registry one... We are a weak, tremulous pair,
Jude, and what others may feel confident in I feel doubts of--my
being proof against the sordid conditions of a business contract
again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they tried to laugh, and went on debating in whispers the
object-lesson before them. And Jude said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) also thought they were
both too thin-skinned--that they ought never to have been born--much
less have come together for the most preposterous of all joint
ventures for THEM--matrimony.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) betrothed shuddered; and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) earnestly if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) indeed
felt that they ought not to go in cold blood and sign that
life-undertaking again? <div class="bookquote">``It is awful if you think we have found
ourselves not strong enough for it, and knowing this, are proposing
to perjure ourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy I do think it--since you ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``Remember I'll
do it if you wish, own darling.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hesitated he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went on to
confess that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought they ought to be able to do it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
felt checked by the dread of incompetency just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did--from their
peculiarities, perhaps, because they were unlike other people. <div class="bookquote">``We
are horribly sensitive; that's really what's the matter with us,
Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy more are like us than we think!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know. The intention of the contract is good, and
right for many, no doubt; but in our case it may defeat its own ends
because we are the queer sort of people we are--folk in whom domestic
ties of a forced kind snuff out cordiality and spontaneousness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue still held that there was not much queer or exceptional in them:
that all were so. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody is getting to feel as we do. We are
a little beforehand, that's all. In fifty, a hundred, years the
descendants of these two will act and feel worse than we. They
will see weltering humanity still more vividly than we do now, as


<p/>Shapes like our own selves hideously multiplied,


<p/>and will be afraid to reproduce them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a terrible line of poetry! ... though I have felt it myself
about my fellow-creatures, at morbid times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue/Sue Bridehead/Bridehead</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus they murmured on, till Sue said more brightly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--the general question is not our business, and why should we
plague ourselves about it? However different our reasons are, we come
to the same conclusion: that for us particular two, an irrevocable
oath is risky. Then, Jude, let us go home without killing our dream!
Yes? How good you are, my friend: you give way to all my whims!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue/Sue Bridehead/Bridehead</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They accord very much with my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) a little kiss behind a pillar while the attention of
everybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession
entering the vestry; and then they came outside the building. By the
door they waited till two or three carriages, which had gone away for
a while, returned, and the new husband and wife came into the open
daylight. Sue sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The flowers in the bride's hand are sadly like the garland which
decked the heifers of sacrifice in old times!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, Sue, it is no worse for the woman than for the man. That's
what some women fail to see, and instead of protesting against the
conditions they protest against the man, the other victim; just as a
woman in a crowd will abuse the man who crushes against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is only the helpless transmitter of the pressure put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--some are like that, instead of uniting with the man against
the common enemy, coercion.''  (<font color='red'><b>The bride bridegroom</b></font>)</div>The bride and bridegroom had by this
time driven off, and the two moved away with the rest of the idlers.
<div class="bookquote">``No--don't let's do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``At least, just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/>They reached home, and passing the window arm in arm saw the widow
looking out at them. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div>cried their guest when they entered, ``I
said to myself when I zeed ye coming so loving up to the door, <div class="bookquote">``They
made up their minds at last, then!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div><p/>They briefly hinted that they had not.

<p/>``What--and ha'n't ye really done it? Chok' it all, that I should
have lived to see a good old saying like `marry in haste and repent
at leisure' spoiled like this by you two! <div class="bookquote">``Tis time I got back again
to Marygreen--sakes if tidden--if this is what the new notions be
leading us to! Nobody thought o' being afeard o' matrimony in my
time, nor of much else but a cannon-ball or empty cupboard! Why when
I and my poor man were married we thought no more o't than of a game
o' dibs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell the child when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>whispered Sue nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll think it has all gone on right, and it will be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
should not be surprised and puzzled. Of course it is only put off
for reconsideration. If we are happy as we are, what does it matter
to anybody?''



 (<font color='red'><b>a chronicler</b></font>)</div><p/>V


<p/>The purpose of a chronicler of moods and deeds does not require him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>)
to express his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) personal views upon the grave controversy above given.
That the twain were happy--between their times of sadness--was
indubitable. And when the unexpected apparition of Jude's child
in the house had shown itself to be no such disturbing event as it
had looked, but one that brought into their lives a new and tender
interest of an ennobling and unselfish kind, it rather helped than
injured their happiness.

<p/>To be sure, with such pleasing anxious beings as they were, the boy's
coming also brought with it much thought for the future, particularly
as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed at present to be singularly deficient in all the usual
hopes of childhood. But the pair tried to dismiss, for a while at
least, a too strenuously forward view.

<p/>There is in Upper Wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls;
the town may be called Stoke-Barehills. It stands with its gaunt,
unattractive, ancient church, and its new red brick suburb, amid
the open, chalk-soiled cornlands, near the middle of an imaginary
triangle which has for its three corners the towns of Aldbrickham
and Wintoncester, and the important military station of Quartershot.
The great western highway from London passes through it, near a point
where the road branches into two, merely to unite again some twenty
miles further westward. Out of this bifurcation and reunion there
used to arise among wheeled travellers, before railway days, endless
questions of choice between the respective ways. But the question
is now as dead as the scot-and-lot freeholder, the road waggoner,
and the mail coachman who disputed it; and probably not a single
inhabitant of Stoke-Barehills is now even aware that the two roads
which part in his (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) town ever meet again; for nobody now drives up and
down the great western highway dally.

<p/>The most familiar object in Stoke-Barehills nowadays is its cemetery,
standing among some picturesque mediæval ruins beside the railway;
the modern chapels, modern tombs, and modern shrubs having a look of
intrusiveness amid the crumbling and ivy-covered decay of the ancient
walls.

<p/>On a certain day, however, in the particular year which has now been
reached by this narrative--the month being early June--the features
of the town excite little interest, though many visitors arrive by
the trains; some down-trains, in especial, nearly emptying themselves
here. It is the week of the Great Wessex Agricultural Show, whose
vast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like
the tents of an investing army. Rows of marquees, huts, booths,
pavilions, arcades, porticoes--every kind of structure short of
a permanent one--cover the green field for the space of a square
half-mile, and the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in
a mass, and make straight for the exhibition ground. The way
thereto is lined with shows, stalls, and hawkers on foot, who make
a market-place of the whole roadway to the show proper, and lead
some of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably before
they reach the gates of the exhibition they came expressly to see.

<p/>It is the popular day, the shilling day, and of the fast arriving
excursion trains two from different directions enter the two
contiguous railway stations at almost the same minute. One, like
several which have preceded it, comes from London: the other by a
cross-line from Aldbrickham; and from the London train alights a
couple; a short, rather bloated man, with a globular stomach and
small legs, resembling a top on two pegs, accompanied by a woman of
rather fine figure and rather red face, dressed in black material,
and covered with beads from bonnet to skirt, that made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glisten
as if clad in chain-mail.

<p/>They cast their eyes around. The man was about to hire a fly as some
others had done, when the woman said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't be in such a hurry,
Cartlett. It isn't so very far to the show-yard. Let us walk down
the street into the place. Perhaps I can pick up a cheap bit of
furniture or old china. It is years since I was here--never since
I lived as a girl at Aldbrickham, and used to come across for a trip
sometimes with my young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't carry home furniture by excursion train,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband landlord Lambeth</b></font>)</div>said, in a thick
voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, the landlord of The Three Horns, Lambeth; for
they had both come down from the tavern in that <div class="bookquote">``excellent, densely
populated, gin-drinking neighbourhood,''  (<font color='red'><b>The Horns</b></font>)</div>which they had occupied ever
since the advertisement in those words had attracted them thither.
The configuration of the landlord showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), too, like his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
customers, was becoming affected by the liquors he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) retailed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll get it sent, if I see any worth having,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife.

<p/>They sauntered on, but had barely entered the town when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) attention
was attracted by a young couple leading a child, who had come out
from the second platform, into which the train from Aldbrickham had
steamed. They were walking just in front of the inn-keepers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sakes alive!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cartlett/Mrs. Cartlett</b></font>)</div>said Cartlett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who do you think that couple is? Don't you recognize the man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not from the photos I have showed you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it Fawley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was inclined for a little sight-seeing like
the rest of us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cartlett/Mrs. Cartlett</b></font>)</div>Cartlett's interest in Jude whatever it might have
been when Arabella was new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), had plainly flagged since her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>)
charms and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) idiosyncrasies, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) supernumerary hair-coils, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>)
optional dimples, were becoming as a tale that is told.

<p/>Arabella so regulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) pace and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) husband's as to keep just in
the rear of the other three, which it was easy to do without notice
in such a stream of pedestrians. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) answers to Cartlett's remarks
were vague and slight, for the group in front interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) more
than all the rest of the spectacle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are rather fond of one another and of their child, seemingly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>continued the publican.

<p/>``THEIR child! ``Tisn't their child,'' said Arabella with a curious,
sudden covetousness. <div class="bookquote">``They haven't been married long enough for it
to be theirs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>But although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) to quash her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) husband's conjecture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) was not
disposed on second thoughts to be more candid than necessary. Mr.
Cartlett had no other idea than that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wife's child by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) first
husband was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) grandparents at the Antipodes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I suppose not. She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) looks quite a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are only lovers, or lately married, and have the child in
charge, as anybody can see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All continued to move ahead. The unwitting Sue and Jude, the couple
in question, had determined to make this agricultural exhibition
within twenty miles of their own town the occasion of a day's
excursion which should combine exercise and amusement with
instruction, at small expense. Not regardful of themselves alone,
they had taken care to bring Father Time, to try every means of
making him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) kindle and laugh like other boys, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was to
some extent a hindrance to the delightfully unreserved intercourse
in their pilgrimages which they so much enjoyed. But they soon
ceased to consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) an observer, and went along with that tender
attention to each other which the shyest can scarcely disguise, and
which these, among entire strangers as they imagined, took less
trouble to disguise than they might have done at home. Sue, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
new summer clothes, flexible and light as a bird, her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) little thumb
stuck up by the stem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) white cotton sunshade, went along as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hardly touched ground, and as if a moderately strong puff of wind
would float her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) over the hedge into the next field. Jude, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
light grey holiday-suit, was really proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) companionship, not
more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) external attractiveness than for her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sympathetic words
and ways. That complete mutual understanding, in which every glance
and movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence
between them, made them almost the two parts of a single whole.

<p/>The pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles, Arabella
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) husband not far behind them. When inside the enclosure the
publican's wife could see that the two ahead began to take trouble
with the youngster, pointing out and explaining the many objects of
interest, alive and dead; and a passing sadness would touch their
faces at their every failure to disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) sticks to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no--I fancy they are not
married, or they wouldn't be so much to one another as that... I
wonder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought you said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did marry her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to--that's all, going to make another attempt,
after putting it off once or twice... As far as they themselves are
concerned they are the only two in the show. I should be ashamed of
making myself so silly if I were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see as how there's anything remarkable in their behaviour.
I should never have noticed their being in love, if you hadn't said
so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never see anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rejoined. Nevertheless Cartlett's view
of the lovers' or married pair's conduct was undoubtedly that of the
general crowd, whose attention seemed to be in no way attracted by
what Arabella's sharpened vision discerned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s charmed by her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were some fairy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>continued Arabella.
<div class="bookquote">``See how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks round at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and lets his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes rest on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I am
inclined to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) don't care for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quite so much as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
does for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not a particular warm-hearted creature to my
thinking, though she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cares for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pretty middling much--as much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s able to; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could make her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heart ache a bit if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked to
try--which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s too simple to do. There--now they are going across
to the cart-horse sheds. Come along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to see the cart-horses. It is no business of ours to
follow these two. If we have come to see the show let us see it in
our own way, as they do in theirs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--suppose we agree to meet somewhere in an hour's time--say at
that refreshment tent over there, and go about independent? Then you
can look at what you choose to, and so can I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cartlett/Mrs. Cartlett</b></font>)</div><p/>Cartlett was not loath to agree to this, and they parted--he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
proceeding to the shed where malting processes were being exhibited,
and Arabella in the direction taken by Jude and Sue. Before,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had regained their wake a laughing face met her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was confronted by Anny, the friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) girlhood.

<p/>Anny had burst out in hearty laughter at the mere fact of the chance
encounter. <div class="bookquote">``I am still living down there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was composed. <div class="bookquote">``I am soon going to be married, but my intended
couldn't come up here to-day. But there's lots of us come by
excursion, though I've lost the rest of 'em for the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you met Jude and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) young woman, or wife, or whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is?
I saw 'em by now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Not a glimpse of un for years!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they are close by here somewhere. Yes--there they are--by
that grey horse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) present young woman--wife did you say? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
married again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s pretty, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--nothing to complain of; or jump at. Not much to depend on,
though; a slim, fidgety little thing like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)'s a nice-looking chap, too! You ought to ha' stuck to un,
Arabella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know but I ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>murmured she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>Anny laughed. <div class="bookquote">``That's you, Arabella! Always wanting another man
than your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what woman don't I should like to know? As for that body
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) don't know what love is--at least what I call love! I
can see in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And perhaps, Abby dear, you don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Abby</b></font>) calls love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't wish to! ... Ah--they are making for the art
department. I should like to see some pictures myself. Suppose
we go that way?-- Why, if all Wessex isn't here, I verily believe!
There's Dr. Vilbert. Haven't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for years, and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not
looking a day older than when I used to know him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). How do you do,
Physician? I was just saying that you don't look a day older than
when you knew me as a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Simply the result of taking my own pills regular, ma'am. Only two
and threepence a box--warranted efficacious by the Government stamp.
Now let me advise you to purchase the same immunity from the ravages
of time by following my example? Only two-and-three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The physician</b></font>)</div><p/>The physician had produced a box from his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) waistcoat pocket, and
Arabella was induced to make the purchase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the same time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), when the pills were paid for, <div class="bookquote">``you
have the advantage of me, Mrs.-- Surely not Mrs. Fawley, once Miss

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But Mrs. Cartlett now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--you lost him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), then? Promising young fellow! A pupil of mine,
you know. I taught him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) the dead languages. And believe me, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) soon
knew nearly as much as I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I lost him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>); but not as you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella dryly. <div class="bookquote">``The
lawyers untied us. There he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) is, look, alive and lusty; along with
that young woman, entering the art exhibition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--dear me! Fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), apparently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They SAY they are cousins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousinship is a great convenience to their feelings, I should say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. So her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband thought, no doubt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) divorced
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)... Shall we look at the pictures, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The trio</b></font>)</div><p/>The trio followed across the green and entered. Jude and Sue, with
the child, unaware of the interest they were exciting, had gone
up to a model at one end of the building, which they regarded
with considerable attention for a long while before they went
on. Arabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) friends came to it in due course, and the
inscription it bore was: <div class="bookquote">``Model of Cardinal College, Christminster;
by J. Fawley and S. F. M. Bridehead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Admiring their own work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``How like Jude--always
thinking of colleges and Christminster, instead of attending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
business!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They glanced cursorily at the pictures, and proceeded to the
band-stand. When they had stood a little while listening to the
music of the military performers, Jude, Sue, and the child came up on
the other side. Arabella did not care if they should recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>);
but they were too deeply absorbed in their own lives, as translated
into emotion by the military band, to perceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) beaded
veil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) walked round the outside of the listening throng, passing
behind the lovers, whose movements had an unexpected fascination for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to-day. Scrutinizing them narrowly from the rear she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) noticed
that Jude's hand sought Sue's as they stood, the two standing close
together so as to conceal, as they supposed, this tacit expression
of their mutual responsiveness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silly fools--like two children!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>Arabella whispered to herself
morosely, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) companions, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) preserved a
preoccupied silence.

<p/>Anny meanwhile had jokingly remarked to Vilbert on Arabella's
hankering interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) first husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>said the physician to Arabella, apart; <div class="bookquote">``do you want anything
such as this, Mrs. Cartlett? It is not compounded out of my regular
pharmacopoeia, but I am sometimes asked for such a thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
produced a small phial of clear liquid. <div class="bookquote">``A love-philtre, such as was
used by the ancients with great effect. I found it out by study of
their writings, and have never known it to fail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it made of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>asked Arabella curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--a distillation of the juices of doves' hearts--otherwise
pigeons'--is one of the ingredients. It took nearly a hundred hearts
to produce that small bottle full.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you get pigeons enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell a secret, I get a piece of rock-salt, of which pigeons are
inordinately fond, and place it in a dovecot on my roof. In a few
hours the birds come to it from all points of the compass--east,
west, north, and south--and thus I secure as many as I require.
You use the liquid by contriving that the desired man shall take
about ten drops of it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drink. But remember, all this is told
you because I gather from your questions that you mean to be a
purchaser. You must keep faith with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--I don't mind a bottle--to give some friend or other to
try it on her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) young man.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) produced five shillings, the price
asked, and slipped the phial in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) capacious bosom. Saying
presently that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was due at an appointment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
sauntered away towards the refreshment bar, Jude, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) companion, and
the child having gone on to the horticultural tent, where Arabella
caught a glimpse of them standing before a group of roses in bloom.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) waited a few minutes observing them, and then proceeded to join
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) spouse with no very amiable sentiments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) seated on
a stool by the bar, talking to one of the gaily dressed maids who had
served him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) with spirits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think you had enough of this business at home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>Arabella
remarked gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``Surely you didn't come fifty miles from your own
bar to stick in another? Come, take me round the show, as other men
do their wives! Dammy, one would think you were a young bachelor,
with nobody to look after but yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we agreed to meet here; and what could I do but wait?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now we have met, come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) returned, ready to quarrel
with the sun for shining on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). And they left the tent together,
this pot-bellied man and florid woman, in the antipathetic,
recriminatory mood of the average husband and wife of Christendom.

<p/>In the meantime the more exceptional couple and the boy still
lingered in the pavilion of flowers--an enchanted palace to their
appreciative taste--Sue's usually pale cheeks reflecting the pink of
the tinted roses at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) gazed; for the gay sights, the air, the
music, and the excitement of a day's outing with Jude had quickened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) blood and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes sparkle with vivacity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) adored roses,
and what Arabella had witnessed was Sue detaining Jude almost against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) will while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) learnt the names of this variety and that, and put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face within an inch of their blooms to smell them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to push my face quite into them--the dears!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
said. <div class="bookquote">``But I suppose it is against the rules to touch them--isn't
it, Jude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>): and then playfully gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) a little push,
so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) nose went among the petals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The policeman will be down on us, and I shall say it was my
husband's fault!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), and smiled in a way that told so much to
Arabella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? Because you have come to the great Wessex Agricultural
Show--or because WE have come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are always trying to make me confess to all sorts of
absurdities. Because I am improving my mind, of course, by seeing
all these steam-ploughs, and threshing-machines, and chaff-cutters,
and cows, and pigs, and sheep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude was quite content with a baffle from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ever evasive companion.
But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had forgotten that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had put the question, and because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) no longer wished for an answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``I feel that we have
returned to Greek joyousness, and have blinded ourselves to sickness
and sorrow, and have forgotten what twenty-five centuries have taught
the race since their time, as one of your Christminster luminaries
says... There is one immediate shadow, however--only one.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked at the aged child, whom, though they had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to
everything likely to attract a young intelligence, they had utterly
failed to interest.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew what they were saying and thinking. <div class="bookquote">``I am very, very sorry,
Father and Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But please don't mind!--I can't help
it. I should like the flowers very very much, if I didn't keep on
thinking they'd be all withered in a few days!''



 (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div><p/>VI


<p/>The unnoticed lives that the pair had hitherto led began, from the
day of the suspended wedding onwards, to be observed and discussed by
other persons than Arabella. The society of Spring Street and the
neighbourhood generally did not understand, and probably could not
have been made to understand, Sue and Jude's private minds, emotions,
positions, and fears. The curious facts of a child coming to them
unexpectedly, who called Jude <div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>and Sue <div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>and a hitch
in a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a
registrar's office, together with rumours of the undefended cases in
the law-courts, bore only one translation to plain minds.

<p/>Little Time--for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was formally turned into <div class="bookquote">``Jude,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the apt
nickname stuck to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)--would come home from school in the evening,
and repeat inquiries and remarks that had been made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) by the
other boys; and cause Sue, and Jude when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heard them, a great deal
of pain and sadness.

<p/>The result was that shortly after the attempt at the registrar's the
pair went off--to London it was believed--for several days, hiring
somebody to look to the boy. When they came back they let it be
understood indirectly, and with total indifference and weariness
of mien, that they were legally married at last. Sue, who had
previously been called Mrs. Bridehead now openly adopted the name of
Mrs. Fawley. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) dull, cowed, and listless manner for days seemed
to substantiate all this.

<p/>But the mistake -LRB-as it was called-RRB- of their going away so secretly
to do the business, kept up much of the mystery of their lives; and
they found that they made not such advances with their neighbours as
they had expected to do thereby. A living mystery was not much less
interesting than a dead scandal.

<p/>The baker's lad and the grocer's boy, who at first had used to lift
their hats gallantly to Sue when they came to execute their errands,
in these days no longer took the trouble to render her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) that homage,
and the neighbouring artizans' wives looked straight along the
pavement when they encountered her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).

<p/>Nobody molested them, it is true; but an oppressive atmosphere began
to encircle their souls, particularly after their excursion to the
show, as if that visit had brought some evil influence to bear on
them. And their temperaments were precisely of a kind to suffer from
this atmosphere, and to be indisposed to lighten it by vigorous and
open statements. Their apparent attempt at reparation had come too
late to be effective.

<p/>The headstone and epitaph orders fell off: and two or three months
later, when autumn came, Jude perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would have to return
to journey-work again, a course all the more unfortunate just now,
in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had not as yet cleared off the debt he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had unavoidably
incurred in the payment of the law-costs of the previous year.

<p/>One evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sat down to share the common meal with Sue and the
child as usual. <div class="bookquote">``I am thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I'll hold on
here no longer. The life suits us, certainly; but if we could get
away to a place where we are unknown, we should be lighter hearted,
and have a better chance. And so I am afraid we must break it up
here, however awkward for you, poor dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue was always much affected at a picture of herself as an object of
pity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) saddened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I am not sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) presently. <div class="bookquote">``I am much depressed
by the way they look at me here. And you have been keeping on this
house and furniture entirely for me and the boy! You don't want
it yourself, and the expense is unnecessary. But whatever we do,
wherever we go, you won't take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) away from me, Jude dear? I could
not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) go now! The cloud upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) young mind makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) so
pathetic to me; I do hope to lift it some day! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) loves me so.
You won't take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) away from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I won't, dear little girl! We'll get nice lodgings,
wherever we go. I shall be moving about probably--getting a job
here and a job there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall do something too, of course, till--till-- Well, now I can't
be useful in the lettering it behoves me to turn my hand to something
else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't hurry about getting employment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said regretfully. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't want you to do that. I wish you wouldn't, Sue. The boy and
yourself are enough for you to attend to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a knock at the door, and Jude answered it. Sue could hear
the conversation:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Fawley at home? ... Biles and Willis, the building
contractors, sent me to know if you'll undertake the relettering
of the ten commandments in a little church they've been restoring
lately in the country near here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude reflected, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could undertake it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not a very artistic job,''  (<font color='red'><b>the messenger</b></font>)</div>continued the messenger. <div class="bookquote">``The
clergyman is a very old-fashioned chap, and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) has refused to let
anything more be done to the church than cleaning and repairing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent old man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue to herself, who was sentimentally
opposed to the horrors of over-restoration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Ten Commandments are fixed to the east end,''  (<font color='red'><b>the messenger</b></font>)</div>the messenger went
on, <div class="bookquote">``and they want doing up with the rest of the wall there, since
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't have them carted off as old materials belonging to the
contractor in the usual way of the trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the messenger</b></font>)</div><p/>A bargain as to terms was struck, and Jude came indoors. <div class="bookquote">``There, you
see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``One more job yet, at any rate, and you
can help in it--at least you can try. We shall have all the church
to ourselves, as the rest of the work is finished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Next day Jude went out to the church, which was only two miles
off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found that what the contractor's clerk had said was true.
The tables of the Jewish law towered sternly over the utensils of
Christian grace, as the chief ornament of the chancel end, in the
fine dry style of the last century. And as their framework was
constructed of ornamental plaster they could not be taken down for
repair. A portion, crumbled by damp, required renewal; and when
this had been done, and the whole cleansed, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) began to renew the
lettering. On the second morning Sue came to see what assistance
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could render, and also because they liked to be together.

<p/>The silence and emptiness of the building gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) confidence, and,
standing on a safe low platform erected by Jude, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
nevertheless timid at mounting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) began painting in the letters
of the first Table while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) set about mending a portion of the
second. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was quite pleased at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) powers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had acquired them
in the days she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) painted illumined texts for the church-fitting shop
at Christminster. Nobody seemed likely to disturb them; and the
pleasant twitter of birds, and rustle of October leafage, came in
through an open window, and mingled with their talk.

<p/>They were not, however, to be left thus snug and peaceful for long.
About half-past twelve there came footsteps on the gravel without.
The old vicar and his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) churchwarden entered, and, coming up to see
what was being done, seemed surprised to discover that a young woman
was assisting. They passed on into an aisle, at which time the door
again opened, and another figure entered--a small one, that of little
Time, who was crying. Sue had told him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) might find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
between school-hours, if he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) wished. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came down from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perch,
and said, <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't stay to eat my dinner in school, because they said--''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) described how some boys had taunted him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) nominal mother,
and Sue, grieved, expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) indignation to Jude aloft. The child
went into the churchyard, and Sue returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) work. Meanwhile
the door had opened again, and there shuffled in with a businesslike
air the white-aproned woman who cleaned the church. Sue recognized
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as one who had friends in Spring Street, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visited. The
church-cleaner looked at Sue, gaped, and lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hands; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
evidently recognized Jude's companion as the latter had recognized
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). Next came two ladies, and after talking to the charwoman they
also moved forward, and as Sue stood reaching upward, watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
hand tracing the letters, and critically regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) person in
relief against the white wall, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) grew so nervous that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
trembled visibly.

<p/>They went back to where the others were standing, talking in
undertones: and one said--Sue could not hear which--<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife,
I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some say Yes: some say No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the charwoman</b></font>)</div>was the reply from the charwoman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ought to be, or somebody's--that's very clear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've only been married a very few weeks, whether or no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A strange pair to be painting the Two Tables! I wonder Biles and
Willis could think of such a thing as hiring those!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biles</b></font>)</div><p/>The churchwarden supposed that Biles and Willis knew of nothing
wrong, and then the other, who had been talking to the old woman,
explained what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant by calling them strange people.

<p/>The probable drift of the subdued conversation which followed was
made plain by the churchwarden breaking into an anecdote, in a voice
that everybody in the church could hear, though obviously suggested
by the present situation:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, it is a curious thing, but my grandfather told me a
strange tale of a most immoral case that happened at the painting of
the Commandments in a church out by Gaymead--which is quite within a
walk of this one. In them days Commandments were mostly done in gilt
letters on a black ground, and that's how they were out where I say,
before the owld church was rebuilded. It must have been somewhere
about a hundred years ago that them Commandments wanted doing up just
as ours do here, and they had to get men from Aldbrickham to do 'em.
Now they wished to get the job finished by a particular Sunday, so
the men had to work late Saturday night, against their will, for
overtime was not paid then as `tis now. There was no true religion
in the country at that date, neither among pa`sons, clerks, nor
people, and to keep the men up to their work the vicar had to let 'em
have plenty of drink during the afternoon. As evening drawed on they
sent for some more themselves; rum, by all account. It got later and
later, and they got more and more fuddled, till at last they went
a-putting their rum-bottle and rummers upon the communion table, and
drawed up a trestle or two, and sate round comfortable and poured
out again right hearty bumpers. No sooner had they tossed off their
glasses than, so the story goes, they fell down senseless, one and
all. How long they bode so they didn't know, but when they came
to themselves there was a terrible thunder-storm a-raging, and
they seemed to see in the gloom a dark figure with very thin legs
and a curious voot, a-standing on the ladder, and finishing their
work. When it got daylight they could see that the work was really
finished, and couldn't at all mind finishing it themselves. They
went home, and the next thing they heard was that a great scandal had
been caused in the church that Sunday morning, for when the people
came and service began, all saw that the Ten Commandments wez painted
with the `nots' left out. Decent people wouldn't attend service
there for a long time, and the Bishop had to be sent for to
reconsecrate the church. That's the tradition as I used to hear it
as a child. You must take it for what it is wo`th, but this case
to-day has reminded me o`t, as I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>The visitors gave one more glance, as if to see whether Jude and
Sue had left the <div class="bookquote">``nots''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>out likewise, and then severally left the
church, even the old woman at last. Sue and Jude, who had not
stopped working, sent back the child to school, and remained without
speaking; till, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) narrowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been crying
silently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, comrade!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I know what it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't BEAR that they, and everybody, should think people wicked
because they may have chosen to live their own way! It is really
these opinions that make the best intentioned people reckless, and
actually become immoral!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never be cast down! It was only a funny story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but we suggested it! I am afraid I have done you mischief,
Jude, instead of helping you by coming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>To have suggested such a story was certainly not very exhilarating,
in a serious view of their position. However, in a few minutes Sue
seemed to see that their position this morning had a ludicrous side,
and wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is droll, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that we two, of all people,
with our queer history, should happen to be here painting the
Ten Commandments! You a reprobate, and I--in my condition... O
dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>... And with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laughed again
silently and intermittently, till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was quite weak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude gaily. <div class="bookquote">``Now we are right again, aren't
we, little girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but it is serious, all the same!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sighed as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took up the
brush and righted herself. ``But do you see they don't think we are
married? They WON<div class="bookquote">``T believe it! It is extraordinary!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care whether they think so or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't
take any more trouble to make them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>They sat down to lunch--which they had brought with them not to
hinder time--and having eaten it, were about to set to work anew when
a man entered the church, and Jude recognized in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) the contractor
Willis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) beckoned to Jude, and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) apart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here--I've just had a complaint about this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, with rather
breathless awkwardness. <div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to go into the matter--as of
course I didn't know what was going on--but I am afraid I must ask
you and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to leave off, and let somebody else finish this! It is
best, to avoid all unpleasantness. I'll pay you for the week, all
the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude was too independent to make any fuss; and the contractor paid
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and left. Jude picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tools, and Sue cleansed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) brush.
Then their eyes met.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could we be so simple as to suppose we might do this!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), dropping to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tragic note. <div class="bookquote">``Of course we ought not--I ought
not--to have come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no idea that anybody was going to intrude into such a lonely
place and see us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude returned. <div class="bookquote">``Well, it can't be helped, dear;
and of course I wouldn't wish to injure Willis's trade-connection by
staying.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>They sat down passively for a few minutes, proceeded out
of the church, and overtaking the boy pursued their thoughtful way
to Aldbrickham.

<p/>Fawley had still a pretty zeal in the cause of education, and, as was
natural with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) experiences, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) was active in furthering <div class="bookquote">``equality
of opportunity''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by any humble means open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) had joined an
Artizans' Mutual Improvement Society established in the town about
the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) arrival there; its members being young men of all
creeds and denominations, including Churchmen, Congregationalists,
Baptists, Unitarians, Positivists, and others--Agnostics had scarcely
been heard of at this time--their one common wish to enlarge their
minds forming a sufficiently close bond of union. The subscription
was small, and the room homely; and Jude's activity, uncustomary
acquirements, and, above all, singular intuition on what to read
and how to set about it--begotten of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) years of struggle against
malignant stars--had led to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) being placed on the committee.

<p/>A few evenings after his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dismissal from the church repairs, and
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had obtained any more work to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went to attend a
meeting of the aforesaid committee. It was late when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arrived: all
the others had come, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) entered they looked dubiously at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
and hardly uttered a word of greeting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) guessed that something
bearing on himself had been either discussed or mooted. Some
ordinary business was transacted, and it was disclosed that the
number of subscriptions had shown a sudden falling off for that
quarter. One member--a really well-meaning and upright man--began
speaking in enigmas about certain possible causes: that it behoved
them to look well into their constitution; for if the committee were
not respected, and had not at least, in their differences, a common
standard of CONDUCT, they would bring the institution to the ground.
Nothing further was said in Jude's presence, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew what this
meant; and turning to the table wrote a note resigning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) office
there and then.

<p/>Thus the supersensitive couple were more and more impelled to go
away. And then bills were sent in, and the question arose, what
could Jude do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) great-aunt's heavy old furniture, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) left
the town to travel he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew not whither? This, and the necessity of
ready money, compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to decide on an auction, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would
have preferred to keep the venerable goods.

<p/>The day of the sale came on; and Sue for the last time cooked her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>)
own, the child's, and Jude's breakfast in the little house he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
furnished. It chanced to be a wet day; moreover Sue was unwell, and
not wishing to desert her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) poor Jude in such gloomy circumstances,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was compelled to stay awhile, she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) acted on the suggestion of
the auctioneer's man, and ensconced herself in an upper room, which
could be emptied of its effects, and so kept closed to the bidders.
Here Jude discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>); and with the child, and their few trunks,
baskets, and bundles, and two chairs and a table that were not in
the sale, the two sat in meditative talk.

<p/>Footsteps began stamping up and down the bare stairs, the comers
inspecting the goods, some of which were of so quaint and ancient a
make as to acquire an adventitious value as art. Their door was
tried once or twice, and to guard themselves against intrusion Jude
wrote <div class="bookquote">``Private''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>on a scrap of paper, and stuck it upon the panel.

<p/>They soon found that, instead of the furniture, their own personal
histories and past conduct began to be discussed to an unexpected
and intolerable extent by the intending bidders. It was not till
now that they really discovered what a fools' paradise of supposed
unrecognition they had been living in of late. Sue silently took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) companion's hand, and with eyes on each other they heard these
passing remarks--the quaint and mysterious personality of Father
Time being a subject which formed a large ingredient in the hints and
innuendoes. At length the auction began in the room below, whence
they could hear each familiar article knocked down, the highly prized
ones cheaply, the unconsidered at an unexpected price.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People don't understand us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sighed heavily. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad we have
decided to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The question is, where to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ought to be to London. There one can live as one chooses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not London, dear! I know it well. We should be unhappy there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because Arabella is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the chief reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But in the country I shall always be uneasy lest there should be
some more of our late experience. And I don't care to lessen it by
explaining, for one thing, all about the boy's history. To cut him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
off from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) past I have determined to keep silence. I am sickened
of ecclesiastical work now; and I shouldn't like to accept it, if
offered me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have learnt classic. Gothic is barbaric art, after
all. Pugin was wrong, and Wren was right. Remember the interior of
Christminster Cathedral--almost the first place in which we looked
in each other's faces. Under the picturesqueness of those Norman
details one can see the grotesque childishness of uncouth people
trying to imitate the vanished Roman forms, remembered by dim
tradition only.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--you have half-converted me to that view by what you have said
before. But one can work, and despise what one does. I must do
something, if not church-gothic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we could both follow an occupation in which personal
circumstances don't count,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) said, smiling up wistfully. <div class="bookquote">``I am
as disqualified for teaching as you are for ecclesiastical art. You
must fall back upon railway stations, bridges, theatres, music-halls,
hotels--everything that has no connection with conduct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not skilled in those... I ought to take to bread-baking. I
grew up in the baking business with aunt, you know. But even a baker
must be conventional, to get customers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) keeps a cake and gingerbread stall at markets and fairs,
where people are gloriously indifferent to everything except the
quality of the goods.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div><p/>Their thoughts were diverted by the voice of the auctioneer: <div class="bookquote">``Now
this antique oak settle--a unique example of old English furniture,
worthy the attention of all collectors!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was my great-grandfather's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``I wish we could have
kept the poor old thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One by one the articles went, and the afternoon passed away. Jude
and the other two were getting tired and hungry, but after the
conversation they had heard they were shy of going out while the
purchasers were in their line of retreat. However, the later lots
drew on, and it became necessary to emerge into the rain soon, to
take on Sue's things to their temporary lodging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now the next lot: two pairs of pigeons, all alive and plump--a nice
pie for somebody for next Sunday's dinner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The impending sale of these birds had been the most trying suspense
of the whole afternoon. They were Sue's pets, and when it was found
that they could not possibly be kept, more sadness was caused than by
parting from all the furniture. Sue tried to think away her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) tears
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) heard the trifling sum that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) dears were deemed to be worth
advanced by small stages to the price at which they were finally
knocked down. The purchaser was a neighbouring poulterer, and they
were unquestionably doomed to die before the next market day.

<p/>Noting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) dissembled distress Jude kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and said it was time
to go and see if the lodgings were ready. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would go on with the
boy, and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) soon.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was left alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) waited patiently, but Jude did not come
back. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) started, the coast being clear, and on passing the
poulterer's shop, not far off, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pigeons in a hamper by the
door. An emotion at sight of them, assisted by the growing dusk of
evening, caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to act on impulse, and first looking around her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
quickly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover, and
went on. The cover was lifted from within, and the pigeons flew
away with a clatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and
swearing to the door.

<p/>Sue reached the lodging trembling, and found Jude and the boy making
it comfortable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do the buyers pay before they bring away
the things?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) asked breathlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, then, I've done such a wicked thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) explained,
in bitter contrition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to pay the poulterer for them, if he (<font color='blue'><b>great-grandfather</b></font>) doesn't catch
them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``But never mind. Don't fret about it, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was so foolish of me! Oh why should Nature's law be mutual
butchery!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it so, Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the boy intently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue vehemently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they must take their chance, now, poor things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.
<div class="bookquote">``As soon as the sale-account is wound up, and our bills paid, we go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do we go to?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Time, in suspense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must sail under sealed orders, that nobody may trace us... We
mustn't go to Alfredston, or to Melchester, or to Shaston, or to
Christminster. Apart from those we may go anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why mustn't we go there, Father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because of a cloud that has gathered over us; though `we have
wronged no man, corrupted no man, defrauded no man!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Though perhaps
we have `done that which was right in our own eyes.'''



<p/>VII


<p/>From that week Jude Fawley and Sue walked no more in the town of
Aldbrickham.

<p/>Whither they had gone nobody knew, chiefly because nobody cared
to know. Any one sufficiently curious to trace the steps of such
an obscure pair might have discovered without great trouble that
they had taken advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) adaptive craftsmanship to enter
on a shifting, almost nomadic, life, which was not without its
pleasantness for a time.

<p/>Wherever Jude heard of free-stone work to be done, thither he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went,
choosing by preference places remote from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old haunts and Sue's.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) laboured at a job, long or briefly, till it was finished; and
then moved on.

<p/>Two whole years and a half passed thus. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might have
been found shaping the mullions of a country mansion, sometimes
setting the parapet of a town-hall, sometimes ashlaring an hotel at
Sandbourne, sometimes a museum at Casterbridge, sometimes as far down
as Exonbury, sometimes at Stoke-Barehills. Later still he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was at
Kennetbridge, a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of
Marygreen, this being his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) nearest approach to the village where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
was known; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
life and fortunes by those who had been acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) during
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ardent young manhood of study and promise, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) brief and
unhappy married life at that time.

<p/>At some of these places he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would be detained for months, at others
only a few weeks. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) curious and sudden antipathy to ecclesiastical
work, both episcopal and noncomformist, which had risen in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) when
suffering under a smarting sense of misconception, remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
in cold blood, less from any fear of renewed censure than from an
ultra-conscientiousness which would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to seek a living
out of those who would disapprove of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ways; also, too, from a
sense of inconsistency between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) former dogmas and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) present
practice, hardly a shred of the beliefs with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had first
gone up to Christminster now remaining with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was mentally
approaching the position which Sue had occupied when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) first met
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>On a Saturday evening in May, nearly three years after Arabella's
recognition of Sue and himself at the agricultural show, some of
those who there encountered each other met again.

<p/>It was the spring fair at Kennetbridge, and, though this ancient
trade-meeting had much dwindled from its dimensions of former times,
the long straight street of the borough presented a lively scene
about midday. At this hour a light trap, among other vehicles,
was driven into the town by the north road, and up to the door of
a temperance inn. There alighted two women, one the driver, an
ordinary country person, the other a finely built figure in the deep
mourning of a widow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sombre suit, of pronounced cut, caused
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) to appear a little out of place in the medley and bustle of a
provincial fair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will just find out where it is, Anny,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said the widow-lady to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
companion, when the horse and cart had been taken by a man who came
forward: <div class="bookquote">``and then I'll come back, and meet you here; and we'll go
in and have something to eat and drink. I begin to feel quite a
sinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. <div class="bookquote">``Though I would sooner have
put up at the Chequers or The Jack. You can't get much at these
temperance houses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't you give way to gluttonous desires, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the
woman in weeds reprovingly. <div class="bookquote">``This is the proper place. Very well:
we'll meet in half an hour, unless you come with me to find out where
the site of the new chapel is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care to. You can tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The companions</b></font>)</div><p/>The companions then went their several ways, the one in crape walking
firmly along with a mien of disconnection from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) miscellaneous
surroundings. Making inquiries she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to a hoarding, within which
were excavations denoting the foundations of a building; and on
the boards without one or two large posters announcing that the
foundation-stone of the chapel about to be erected would be laid that
afternoon at three o'clock by a London preacher of great popularity
among his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) body.

<p/>Having ascertained thus much the immensely weeded widow retraced her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
steps, and gave herself leisure to observe the movements of the fair.
By and by her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) attention was arrested by a little stall of cakes and
ginger-breads, standing between the more pretentious erections of
trestles and canvas. It was covered with an immaculate cloth, and
tended by a young woman apparently unused to the business, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being
accompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face, who assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my--senses!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>murmured the widow to herself. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife Sue--if
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is so!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) drew nearer to the stall. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mrs.
Fawley?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said blandly.

<p/>Sue changed colour and recognized Arabella through the crape veil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you, Mrs. Cartlett?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said stiffly. And then perceiving
Arabella's garb her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself.
<div class="bookquote">``What?--you have lost--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor husband. Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) died suddenly, six weeks ago, leaving me
none too well off, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a kind husband to me. But whatever
profit there is in public-house keeping goes to them that brew the
liquors, and not to them that retail 'em... And you, my little old
man! You don't know me, I expect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. You be the woman I thought wer my mother for a bit, till
I found you wasn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>replied Father Time, who had learned to use the
Wessex tongue quite naturally by now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right. Never mind. I am a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Juey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``go down to the station platform with this
tray--there's another train coming in, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was gone Arabella continued: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll never be a beauty, will
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), poor chap! Does he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) know I am his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thinks there is some mystery about his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) parentage--that's all.
Jude is going to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) is a little older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how do you come to be doing this? I am surprised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only a temporary occupation--a fancy of ours while we are in a
difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are living with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) still?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any children?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And another coming soon, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue writhed under the hard and direct questioning, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) tender
little mouth began to quiver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord--I mean goodness gracious--what is there to cry about? Some
folks would be proud enough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that I am ashamed--not as you think! But it seems
such a terribly tragic thing to bring beings into the world--so
presumptuous--that I question my right to do it sometimes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it easy, my dear... But you don't tell me why you do such a
thing as this? Jude used to be a proud sort of chap--above any
business almost, leave alone keeping a standing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps my husband has altered a little since then. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
is not proud now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>And Sue's lips quivered again. <div class="bookquote">``I am doing this
because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) caught a chill early in the year while putting up some
stonework of a music-hall, at Quartershot, which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to do in the
rain, the work having to be executed by a fixed day. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is better
than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was; but it has been a long, weary time! We have had an old
widow friend with us to help us through it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'s leaving soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am respectable too, thank God, and of a serious way of
thinking since my loss. Why did you choose to sell gingerbreads?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a pure accident. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was brought up to the baking business,
and it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to try his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand at these, which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) can make
without coming out of doors. We call them Christminster cakes.
They are a great success.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw any like 'em. Why, they are windows and towers, and
pinnacles! And upon my word they are very nice.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had helped
herself, and was unceremoniously munching one of the cakes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. They are reminiscences of the Christminster Colleges.
Traceried windows, and cloisters, you see. It was a whim of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
to do them in pastry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still harping on Christminster--even in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cakes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>laughed
Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``Just like Jude. A ruling passion. What a queer fellow
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is, and always will be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue sighed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) distress at hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) criticized.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is? Come now; you do, though you are so fond of
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course Christminster is a sort of fixed vision with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), which
I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll never be cured of believing in. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) still thinks it
a great centre of high and fearless thought, instead of what it is,
a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid
obsequiousness to tradition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella was quizzing Sue with more regard of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was speaking
than of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was saying. <div class="bookquote">``How odd to hear a woman selling
cakes talk like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go back to
school-keeping?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``They won't have me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because of the divorce, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That and other things. And there is no reason to wish it. We
gave up all ambition, and were never so happy in our lives till his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
illness came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here in Kennetbridge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue's manner showed Arabella that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) random guess was right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes the boy back again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>continued Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``My boy and
Jude's!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue's eyes darted a spark. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't throw that in my face!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--though I half-feel as if I should like to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with
me! ... But Lord, I don't want to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) from `ee--ever I should
sin to speak so profane--though I should think you must have enough
of your own! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s in very good hands, that I know; and I am not the
woman to find fault with what the Lord has ordained. I've reached a
more resigned frame of mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! I wish I had been able to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should try,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>replied the widow, from the serene heights of a
soul conscious not only of spiritual but of social superiority.
<div class="bookquote">``I make no boast of my awakening, but I'm not what I was. After
Cartlett's death I was passing the chapel in the street next ours,
and went into it for shelter from a shower of rain. I felt a need
of some sort of support under my loss, and, as 'twas righter than
gin, I took to going there regular, and found it a great comfort.
But I've left London now, you know, and at present I am living at
Alfredston, with my friend Anny, to be near my own old country. I'm
not come here to the fair to-day. There's to be the foundation-stone
of a new chapel laid this afternoon by a popular London preacher, and
I drove over with Anny. Now I must go back to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Arabella wished Sue good-bye, and went on.



<p/>VIII


<p/>In the afternoon Sue and the other people bustling about Kennetbridge
fair could hear singing inside the placarded hoarding farther down
the street. Those who peeped through the opening saw a crowd of
persons in broadcloth, with hymn-books in their hands, standing round
the excavations for the new chapel-walls. Arabella Cartlett and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
weeds stood among them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had a clear, powerful voice, which could
be distinctly heard with the rest, rising and falling to the tune,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) inflated bosom being also seen doing likewise.

<p/>It was two hours later on the same day that Anny and Mrs. Cartlett,
having had tea at the Temperance Hotel, started on their return
journey across the high and open country which stretches between
Kennetbridge and Alfredston. Arabella was in a thoughtful mood; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) thoughts were not of the new chapel, as Anny at first surmised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--it is something else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>at last said Arabella sullenly. <div class="bookquote">``I
came here to-day never thinking of anybody but poor Cartlett, or of
anything but spreading the Gospel by means of this new tabernacle
they've begun this afternoon. But something has happened to turn my
mind another way quite. Anny, I've heard of un again, and I've seen
HER!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard of Jude, and I've seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife. And ever since, do what
I will, and though I sung the hymns wi' all my strength, I have not
been able to help thinking about `n; which I've no right to do as a
chapel member.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't ye fix your mind upon what was said by the London preacher
to-day, and try to get rid of your wandering fancies that way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. But my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I know what it is to have a wanton mind o' my own, too! If
you on'y knew what I do dream sometimes o' nights quite against my
wishes, you'd say I had my struggles!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anny</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Anny, too, had grown rather
serious of late, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) lover having jilted her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>).-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I do about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>urged Arabella morbidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You could take a lock of your late-lost husband's hair, and have it
made into a mourning brooch, and look at it every hour of the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't a morsel!--and if I had `twould be no good... After all
that's said about the comforts of this religion, I wish I had Jude
back again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must fight valiant against the feeling, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)'s another's.
And I've heard that another good thing for it, when it afflicts
volupshious widows, is to go to your husband's grave in the dusk of
evening, and stand a long while a-bowed down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! I know as well as you what I should do; only I don't do it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They drove in silence along the straight road till they were within
the horizon of Marygreen, which lay not far to the left of their
route. They came to the junction of the highway and the cross-lane
leading to that village, whose church-tower could be seen athwart the
hollow. When they got yet farther on, and were passing the lonely
house in which Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of
their marriage, and where the pig-killing had taken place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) could
control herself no longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s more mine than hers!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) burst out. <div class="bookquote">``What right has she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), I should like to know! I'd take him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) if I could!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie, Abby! And your husband only six weeks gone! Pray against it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be damned if I do! Feelings are feelings! I won't be a creeping
hypocrite any longer--so there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella had hastily drawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) pocket a bundle of tracts which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) to distribute at the fair, and of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>)
had given away several. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) flung the whole remainder
of the packet into the hedge. <div class="bookquote">``I've tried that sort o' physic and
have failed wi' it. I must be as I was born!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! You be excited, dear! Now you come along home quiet, and
have a cup of tea, and don't let us talk about un no more. We won't
come out this road again, as it leads to where he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) is, because it
inflames `ee so. You'll be all right again soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella did calm herself down by degrees; and they crossed the
ridge-way. When they began to descend the long, straight hill, they
saw plodding along in front of them an elderly man of spare stature
and thoughtful gait. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried a basket; and there was
a touch of slovenliness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attire, together with that indefinable
something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole appearance which suggested one who was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own housekeeper, purveyor, confidant, and friend, through possessing
nobody else at all in the world to act in those capacities for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
The remainder of the journey was down-hill, and guessing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be
going to Alfredston they offered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a lift, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accepted.

<p/>Arabella looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), and looked again, till at length she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``If I don't mistake I am talking to Mr. Phillotson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The wayfarer</b></font>)</div><p/>The wayfarer faced round and regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) in turn. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; my name is
Phillotson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't recognize you, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember you well enough when you used to be schoolmaster out at
Marygreen, and I one of your scholars. I used to walk up there from
Cresscombe every day, because we had only a mistress down at our
place, and you taught better. But you wouldn't remember me as I
should you?--Arabella Donn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said politely, <div class="bookquote">``I don't recall the name.
And I should hardly recognize in your present portly self the slim
school child no doubt you were then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I always had plenty of flesh on my bones. However, I am
staying down here with some friends at present. You know, I suppose,
who I married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jude Fawley--also a scholar of yours--at least a night scholar--for
some little time, I think? And known to you afterwards, if I am not
mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson, starting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) stiffness.
<div class="bookquote">``YOU Fawley's wife? To be sure--he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) had a wife! And he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>)--I
understood--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Divorced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--as you did yours--perhaps for better reasons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) med have been right in doing it--right for both; for I soon
married again, and all went pretty straight till my husband died
lately. But you--you were decidedly wrong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson, with sudden testiness. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather not
talk of this, but--I am convinced I did only what was right, and
just, and moral. I have suffered for my act and opinions, but I hold
to them; though her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loss was a loss to me in more ways than one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You lost your school and good income through her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), did you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care to talk of it. I have recently come back here--to
Marygreen. I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The pressure of a sadness that would out unsealed him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am there,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Just as formerly, no. Merely on sufferance. It was
a last resource--a small thing to return to after my move upwards,
and my long indulged hopes--a returning to zero, with all its
humiliations. But it is a refuge. I like the seclusion of the
place, and the vicar having known me before my so-called eccentric
conduct towards my wife had ruined my reputation as a schoolmaster,
he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) accepted my services when all other schools were closed against
me. However, although I take fifty pounds a year here after taking
above two hundred elsewhere, I prefer it to running the risk of
having my old domestic experiences raked up against me, as I should
do if I tried to make a move.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right you are. A contented mind is a continual feast. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has done
no better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is not doing well, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by accident at Kennetbridge this very day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is
anything but thriving. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband is ill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) anxious. You
made a fool of a mistake about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), I tell `ee again, and the harm
you did yourself by dirting your own nest serves you right, excusing
the liberty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But nonsense! They did not even defend the case!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was because they didn't care to. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was quite innocent of
what obtained you your freedom, at the time you obtained it. I saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) just afterwards, and proved it to myself completely by talking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>Phillotson grasped the edge of the spring-cart, and appeared to be
much stressed and worried by the information. <div class="bookquote">``Still--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted to
go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But you shouldn't have let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). That's the only way with
these fanciful women that chaw high--innocent or guilty. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d have
come round in time. We all do! Custom does it! It's all the same
in the end! However, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) man still--whatever
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) med be of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). You were too quick about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). _I_ shouldn't
have let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) go! I should have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chained on--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spirit for
kicking would have been broke soon enough! There's nothing like
bondage and a stone-deaf taskmaster for taming us women. Besides,
you've got the laws on your side. Moses knew. Don't you call to
mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) says?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for the moment, ma'am, I regret to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Call yourself a schoolmaster! I used to think o't when they read
it in church, and I was carrying on a bit. ``Then shall the man be
guiltless; but the woman shall bear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) iniquity.<div class="bookquote">'' Damn rough on us
women; but we must grin and put up wi' it! Haw haw! Well; she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)'s got
her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) deserts now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson, with biting sadness. <div class="bookquote">``Cruelty is the law
pervading all nature and society; and we can't get out of it if we
would!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--don't you forget to try it next time, old man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot answer you, madam. I have never known much of womankind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>They had now reached the low levels bordering Alfredston, and passing
through the outskirts approached a mill, to which Phillotson said his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
errand led him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>); whereupon they drew up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) alighted, bidding them
good-night in a preoccupied mood.

<p/>In the meantime Sue, though remarkably successful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cake-selling
experiment at Kennetbridge fair, had lost the temporary brightness
which had begun to sit upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sadness on account of that success.
When all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Christminster''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cakes had been disposed of she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) took
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) arm the empty basket, and the cloth which had covered the
standing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had hired, and giving the other things to the boy left
the street with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). They followed a lane to a distance of half a
mile, till they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes,
and leading a toddler in the other hand.

<p/>Sue kissed the children, and said, <div class="bookquote">``How is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still better!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edlin/Edlin</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Edlin cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``Before you are
upstairs again your husband will be well enough--don't `ee trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They turned, and came to some old, dun-tiled cottages with gardens
and fruit-trees. Into one of these they entered by lifting the latch
without knocking, and were at once in the general living-room. Here
they greeted Jude, who was sitting in an arm-chair, the increased
delicacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) normally delicate features, and the childishly
expectant look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes, being alone sufficient to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had been passing through a severe illness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--you have sold them all?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, a gleam of interest lighting
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Arcades, gables, east windows and all.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) the
pecuniary results, and then hesitated. At last, when they were left
alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) of the unexpected meeting with Arabella, and
the latter's widowhood.

<p/>Jude was discomposed. <div class="bookquote">``What--is she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) living here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; at Alfredston,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue.

<p/>Jude's countenance remained clouded. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I had better tell
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) continued, kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes... Dear me! Arabella not in the depths of London, but down
here! It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to
Alfredston. What is she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) doing there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) all she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knew. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) has taken to chapel-going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>Sue
added; <div class="bookquote">``and talks accordingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps it is for the best that we have almost
decided to move on. I feel much better to-day, and shall be well
enough to leave in a week or two. Then Mrs. Edlin can go home
again--dear faithful old soul--the only friend we have in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you think to go to?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sue asked, a troublousness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
tones.

<p/>Then Jude confessed what was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said it would surprise
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), perhaps, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) having resolutely avoided all the old places
for so long. But one thing and another had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) think a great
deal of Christminster lately, and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) didn't mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would like
to go back there. Why should they care if they were known? It was
oversensitive of them to mind so much. They could go on selling
cakes there, for that matter, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) couldn't work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had no sense
of shame at mere poverty; and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would be as strong as ever
soon, and able to set up stone-cutting for himself there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you care so much for Christminster?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said pensively.
<div class="bookquote">``Christminster cares nothing for you, poor dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I do, I can't help it. I love the place--although I know
how it hates all men like me--the so-called self-taught--how it
scorns our laboured acquisitions, when it should be the first
to respect them; how it sneers at our false quantities and
mispronunciations, when it should say, I see you want help, my poor
friend! ... Nevertheless, it is the centre of the universe to me,
because of my early dream: and nothing can alter it. Perhaps it will
soon wake up, and be generous. I pray so! ... I should like to go
back to live there--perhaps to die there! In two or three weeks I
might, I think. It will then be June, and I should like to be there
by a particular day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was recovering proved so far well grounded that
in three weeks they had arrived in the city of many memories; were
actually treading its pavements, receiving the reflection of the
sunshine from its wasting walls.





<p/>Part Sixth


<p/>AT CHRISTMINSTER AGAIN



<p/><div class="bookquote">''... And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) humbled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) body greatly, and all the places

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two who decline, a woman and I,

<p/>I


<p/>On their arrival the station was lively with straw-hatted young men,
welcoming young girls who bore a remarkable family likeness to their
welcomers, and who were dressed up in the brightest and lightest of
raiment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The place seems gay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue. <div class="bookquote">``Why--it is Remembrance
Day!--Jude--how sly of you--you came to-day on purpose!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude quietly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took charge of the small child, and
told Arabella's boy to keep close to them, Sue attending to their own
eldest. <div class="bookquote">``I thought we might as well come to-day as on any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am afraid it will depress you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, looking anxiously at
him (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) up and down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I mustn't let it interfere with our business; and we have a good
deal to do before we shall be settled here. The first thing is
lodgings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the holiday people all</b></font>)</div><p/>Having left their luggage and his (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) tools at the station they proceeded
on foot up the familiar street, the holiday people all drifting in
the same direction. Reaching the Fourways they were about to turn
off to where accommodation was likely to be found when, looking at
the clock and the hurrying crowd, Jude said: <div class="bookquote">``Let us go and see the
procession, and never mind the lodgings just now. We can get them
afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oughtn't we to get a house over our heads first?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) asked.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) soul seemed full of the anniversary, and together they went
down Chief Street, their smallest child in Jude's arms, Sue leading
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) little girl, and Arabella's boy walking thoughtfully and silently
beside them. Crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes, and meekly
ignorant parents who had known no college in their youth, were under
convoy in the same direction by brothers and sons bearing the opinion
written large on them that no properly qualified human beings had
lived on earth till they came to grace it here and now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My failure is reflected on me by every one of those young
fellows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``A lesson on presumption is awaiting me
to-day!--Humiliation Day for me! ... If you, my dear darling, hadn't
come to my rescue, I should have gone to the dogs with despair!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) saw from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was getting into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
tempestuous, self-harrowing moods. <div class="bookquote">``It would have been better if we
had gone at once about our own affairs, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I am
sure this sight will awaken old sorrows in you, and do no good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--we are near; we will see it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>They turned in on the left by the church with the Italian porch,
whose helical columns were heavily draped with creepers, and pursued
the lane till there arose on Jude's sight the circular theatre with
that well-known lantern above it, which stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mind as the sad
symbol of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) abandoned hopes, for it was from that outlook that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had finally surveyed the City of Colleges on the afternoon of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
great meditation, which convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at last of the futility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
attempt to be a son of the university.

<p/>To-day, in the open space stretching between this building and the
nearest college, stood a crowd of expectant people. A passage was
kept clear through their midst by two barriers of timber, extending
from the door of the college to the door of the large building
between it and the theatre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is the place--they are just going to pass!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>cried Jude in
sudden excitement. And pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) way to the front he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took up a
position close to the barrier, still hugging the youngest child in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arms, while Sue and the others kept immediately behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).
The crowd filled in at their back, and fell to talking, joking, and
laughing as carriage after carriage drew up at the lower door of
the college, and solemn stately figures in blood-red robes began to
alight. The sky had grown overcast and livid, and thunder rumbled
now and then.

<p/>Father Time shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``It do seem like the Judgment Day!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are only learned Doctors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue.

<p/>While they waited big drops of rain fell on their heads and
shoulders, and the delay grew tedious. Sue again wished not to stay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They won't be long now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head.

<p/>But the procession did not come forth, and somebody in the crowd, to
pass the time, looked at the façade of the nearest college, and said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wondered what was meant by the Latin inscription in its midst.
Jude, who stood near the inquirer, explained it, and finding that
the people all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) were listening with interest, went on to
describe the carving of the frieze -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had studied years
before-RRB-, and to criticize some details of masonry in other college
fronts about the city.

<p/>The idle crowd, including the two policemen at the doors, stared like
the Lycaonians at Paul, for Jude was apt to get too enthusiastic over
any subject in hand, and they seemed to wonder how the stranger
should know more about the buildings of their town than they
themselves did; till one of them said: <div class="bookquote">``Why, I know that man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used
to work here years ago--Jude Fawley, that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) name! Don't you mind
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) used to be nicknamed Tutor of St. Slums, d'ye mind?--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)
aimed at that line o' business? He (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)'s married, I suppose, then, and
that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) child he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)'s carrying. Taylor would know him (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) knows
everybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>The speaker was a man named Jack Stagg, with whom Jude had formerly
worked in repairing the college masonries; Tinker Taylor was seen to
be standing near. Having his (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) attention called the latter cried
across the barriers to Jude: <div class="bookquote">``You've honoured us by coming back
again, my friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' you don't seem to have done any great things for yourself by
going away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude assented to this also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Except found more mouths to fill!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>This came in a new voice, and
Jude recognized its owner to be Uncle Joe, another mason whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
known.

<p/>Jude replied good-humouredly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not dispute it; and from
remark to remark something like a general conversation arose between
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) and the crowd of idlers, during which Tinker Taylor asked Jude if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remembered the Apostles' Creed in Latin still, and the night of
the challenge in the public house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Fortune didn't lie that way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe</b></font>)</div>threw in Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Yer powers wasn't
enough to carry `ee through?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't answer them any more!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>entreated Sue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I like Christminster!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>murmured little Time
mournfully, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) stood submerged and invisible in the crowd.

<p/>But finding himself the centre of curiosity, quizzing, and comment,
Jude was not inclined to shrink from open declarations of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had no great reason to be ashamed of; and in a little while was
stimulated to say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally:

<p/>``It is a difficult question, my friends, for any young man--that
question I had to grapple with, and which thousands are weighing
at the present moment in these uprising times--whether to follow
uncritically the track he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds himself in, without considering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
aptness for it, or to consider what his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aptness or bent may be, and
re-shape his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) course accordingly. I tried to do the latter, and I
failed. But I don't admit that my failure proved my view to be a
wrong one, or that my success would have made it a right one; though
that's how we appraise such attempts nowadays--I mean, not by their
essential soundness, but by their accidental outcomes. If I had
ended by becoming like one of these gentlemen in red and black that
we saw dropping in here by now, everybody would have said: ``See how
wise that young man was, to follow the bent of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature!'' But
having ended no better than I began they say: <div class="bookquote">``See what a fool that
fellow was in following a freak of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fancy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``However it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be
beaten. It takes two or three generations to do what I tried to do
in one; and my impulses--affections--vices perhaps they should be
called--were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages; who
should be as cold-blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a
really good chance of being one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country's worthies. You may
ridicule me--I am quite willing that you should--I am a fit subject,
no doubt. But I think if you knew what I have gone through these
last few years you would rather pity me. And if they knew'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
nodded towards the college at which the dons were severally
arriving--<div class="bookquote">``it is just possible they would do the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do look ill and worn-out, it is true!''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said a woman.

<p/>Sue's face grew more emotional; but though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood close to Jude
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was screened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may do some good before I am dead--be a sort of success as a
frightful example of what not to do; and so illustrate a moral
story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>continued Jude, beginning to grow bitter, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
opened serenely enough. <div class="bookquote">``I was, perhaps, after all, a paltry victim
to the spirit of mental and social restlessness that makes so many
unhappy in these days!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell them that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>whispered Sue with tears, at perceiving
Jude's state of mind. <div class="bookquote">``You weren't that. You struggled nobly to
acquire knowledge, and only the meanest souls in the world would
blame you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude shifted the child into a more easy position on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm, and
concluded: ``And what I appear, a sick and poor man, is not the worst
of me. I am in a chaos of principles--groping in the dark--acting by
instinct and not after example. Eight or nine years ago when I came
here first, I had a neat stock of fixed opinions, but they dropped
away one by one; and the further I get the less sure I am. I doubt
if I have anything more for my present rule of life than following
inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm, and actually give
pleasure to those I love best. There, gentlemen, since you wanted to
know how I was getting on, I have told you. Much good may it do you!
I cannot explain further here. I perceive there is something wrong
somewhere in our social formulas: what it is can only be discovered
by men or women with greater insight than mine--if, indeed, they ever
discover it--at least in our time. <div class="bookquote">``For who knoweth what is good for
man in this life?--and who can tell a man what shall be after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
under the sun?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the populace</b></font>)</div>said the populace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well preached!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tinker Taylor/Taylor</b></font>)</div>said Tinker Taylor. And privately to his (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)
neighbours: <div class="bookquote">``Why, one of them jobbing pa`sons swarming about here,
that takes the services when our head reverends want a holiday,
wouldn't ha' discoursed such doctrine for less than a guinea down.
Hey? I'll take my oath not one o' 'em would! And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have
had it wrote down for `n. And this only a working-man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>neighbours</b></font>)</div><p/>As a sort of objective commentary on Jude's remarks there drove up
at this moment with a belated Doctor, robed and panting, a cab whose
horse failed to stop at the exact point required for setting down the
hirer, who jumped out and entered the door. The driver, alighting,
began to kick the animal in the belly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that can be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, <div class="bookquote">``at college gates in the most
religious and educational city in the world, what shall we say as to
how far we've got?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Order!''  (<font color='red'><b>the policemen</b></font>)</div>said one of the policemen, who had been engaged with a
comrade in opening the large doors opposite the college. <div class="bookquote">``Keep yer
tongue quiet, my man, while the procession passes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The rain came on
more heavily, and all who had umbrellas opened them. Jude was not
one of these, and Sue only possessed a small one, half sunshade. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
had grown pale, though Jude did not notice it then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go on, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) whispered, endeavouring to shelter him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``We haven't any lodgings yet, remember, and all our things are at the
station; and you are by no means well yet. I am afraid this wet will
hurt you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are coming now. Just a moment, and I'll go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>A peal of six bells struck out, human faces began to crowd the
windows around, and the procession of heads of houses and new Doctors
emerged, their red and black gowned forms passing across the field of
Jude's vision like inaccessible planets across an object-glass.

<p/>As they went their names were called by knowing informants, and when
they reached the old round theatre of Wren a cheer rose high.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go that way!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>cried Jude, and though it now rained steadily
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed not to know it, and took them round to the theatre. Here
they stood upon the straw that was laid to drown the discordant noise
of wheels, where the quaint and frost-eaten stone busts encircling
the building looked with pallid grimness on the proceedings, and in
particular at the bedraggled Jude, Sue, and their children, as at
ludicrous persons who had no business there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could get in!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) fervidly. <div class="bookquote">``Listen--I may
catch a few words of the Latin speech by staying here; the windows
are open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>However, beyond the peals of the organ, and the shouts and hurrahs
between each piece of oratory, Jude's standing in the wet did not
bring much Latin to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) intelligence more than, now and then, a
sonorous word in _um_ or _ibus_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I'm an outsider to the end of my days!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sighed after a
while. <div class="bookquote">``Now I'll go, my patient Sue. How good of you to wait in the
rain all this time--to gratify my infatuation! I'll never care any
more about the infernal cursed place, upon my soul I won't! But what
made you tremble so when we were at the barrier? And how pale you
are, Sue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw Richard amongst the people on the other side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--did you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) is evidently come up to Jerusalem to see the festival like the
rest of us: and on that account is probably living not so very far
away. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had the same hankering for the university that you had, in
a milder form. I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) saw me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) must have heard
you speaking to the crowd. But he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) seemed not to notice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) did. Your mind is free from worries about him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) now,
my Sue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose so. But I am weak. Although I know it is all right
with our plans, I felt a curious dread of him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>); an awe, or terror, of
conventions I don't believe in. It comes over me at times like a
sort of creeping paralysis, and makes me so sad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are getting tired, Sue. Oh--I forgot, darling! Yes, we'll go
on at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>They started in quest of the lodging, and at last found something
that seemed to promise well, in Mildew Lane--a spot which to Jude was
irresistible--though to Sue it was not so fascinating--a narrow lane
close to the back of a college, but having no communication with
it. The little houses were darkened to gloom by the high collegiate
buildings, within which life was so far removed from that of the
people in the lane as if it had been on opposite sides of the globe;
yet only a thickness of wall divided them. Two or three of the
houses had notices of rooms to let, and the newcomers knocked at the
door of one, which a woman opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--listen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude suddenly, instead of addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why the bells--what church can that be? The tones are familiar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Another peal of bells had begun to sound out at some distance off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady tartly. <div class="bookquote">``Did you knock to ask
that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; for lodgings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, coming to himself.

<p/>The householder scrutinized Sue's figure a moment. <div class="bookquote">``We haven't any
to let,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), shutting the door.

<p/>Jude looked discomfited, and the boy distressed. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Jude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said
Sue, <div class="bookquote">``let me try. You don't know the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>They found a second place hard by; but here the occupier, observing
not only Sue, but the boy and the small children, said civilly, <div class="bookquote">``I am
sorry to say we don't let where there are children'' (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>; and also closed
the door.

<p/>The small child squared its mouth and cried silently, with an
instinct that trouble loomed. The boy sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like
Christminster!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Are the great old houses gaols?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; colleges,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude</b></font>)</div>said Jude; <div class="bookquote">``which perhaps you'll study in some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather not!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy rejoined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we'll try again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue. <div class="bookquote">``I'll pull my cloak more round
me... Leaving Kennetbridge for this place is like coming from
Caiaphas to Pilate! ... How do I look now, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody would notice it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/>There was one other house, and they tried a third time. The woman
here was more amiable; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had little room to spare, and could
only agree to take in Sue and the children if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) husband could go
elsewhere. This arrangement they perforce adopted, in the stress
from delaying their search till so late. They came to terms with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) price was rather high for their pockets. But they
could not afford to be critical till Jude had time to get a more
permanent abode; and in this house Sue took possession of a back room
on the second floor with an inner closet-room for the children. Jude
stayed and had a cup of tea; and was pleased to find that the window
commanded the back of another of the colleges. Kissing all four he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
went to get a few necessaries and look for lodgings for himself.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was gone the landlady came up to talk a little with Sue, and
gather something of the circumstances of the family she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had taken in.
Sue had not the art of prevarication, and, after admitting several
facts as to their late difficulties and wanderings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was startled
by the landlady saying suddenly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you really a married woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue hesitated; and then impulsively told the woman that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband
and herself had each been unhappy in their first marriages, after
which, terrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union, and
lest the conditions of the contract should kill their love, yet
wishing to be together, they had literally not found the courage
to repeat it, though they had attempted it two or three times.
Therefore, though in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own sense of the words she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a married
woman, in the landlady's sense she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not.

<p/>The housewife looked embarrassed, and went downstairs. Sue sat by
the window in a reverie, watching the rain. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quiet was broken by
the noise of someone entering the house, and then the voices of a
man and woman in conversation in the passage below. The landlady's
husband had arrived, and she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was explaining to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the incoming of
the lodgers during his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) absence.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) voice rose in sudden anger. <div class="bookquote">``Now who wants such a woman here?
and perhaps a confinement! ... Besides, didn't I say I wouldn't have
children? The hall and stairs fresh painted, to be kicked about by
them! You must have known all was not straight with 'em--coming like
that. Taking in a family when I said a single man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The wife</b></font>)</div><p/>The wife expostulated, but, as it seemed, the husband insisted on
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) point; for presently a tap came to Sue's door, and the woman
appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to tell you, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that I can't let you have
the room for the week after all. My husband objects; and therefore
I must ask you to go. I don't mind your staying over to-night, as
it is getting late in the afternoon; but I shall be glad if you can
leave early in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was entitled to the lodging for a week, Sue
did not wish to create a disturbance between the wife and husband,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would leave as requested. When the landlady had
gone Sue looked out of the window again. Finding that the rain had
ceased she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) proposed to the boy that, after putting the little ones
to bed, they should go out and search about for another place, and
bespeak it for the morrow, so as not to be so hard-driven then as
they had been that day.

<p/>Therefore, instead of unpacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) boxes, which had just been sent
on from the station by Jude, they sallied out into the damp though
not unpleasant streets, Sue resolving not to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) husband
with the news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) notice to quit while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was perhaps worried
in obtaining a lodging for himself. In the company of the boy she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
wandered into this street and into that; but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) tried a dozen
different houses she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) fared far worse alone than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had fared in
Jude's company, and could get nobody to promise her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) a room for the
following day. Every householder looked askance at such a woman and
child inquiring for accommodation in the gloom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought not to be born, ought I?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy with misgiving.

<p/>Thoroughly tired at last Sue returned to the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
not welcome, but where at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had temporary shelter. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
absence Jude had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) address; but knowing how weak he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) still was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) adhered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) determination not to disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) till the next
day.



<p/>II


<p/>Sue sat looking at the bare floor of the room, the house being little
more than an old intramural cottage, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) regarded the scene
outside the uncurtained window. At some distance opposite, the outer
walls of Sarcophagus College--silent, black, and windowless--threw
their four centuries of gloom, bigotry, and decay into the little
room she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) occupied, shutting out the moonlight by night and the sun by
day. The outlines of Rubric College also were discernible beyond the
other, and the tower of a third farther off still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) thought of
the strange operation of a simple-minded man's ruling passion, that
it should have led Jude, who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) and the children so tenderly,
to place them here in this depressing purlieu, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was still
haunted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dream. Even now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not distinctly hear the
freezing negative that those scholared walls had echoed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
desire.

<p/>The failure to find another lodging, and the lack of room in this
house for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) father, had made a deep impression on the boy--a
brooding undemonstrative horror seemed to have seized him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). The
silence was broken by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saying: <div class="bookquote">``Mother, WHAT shall we do
to-morrow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue despondently. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid this will
trouble your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Father was quite well, and there had been room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)!
Then it wouldn't matter so much! Poor Father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I do anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! All is trouble, adversity, and suffering!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father went away to give us children room, didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be better to be out o' the world than in it, wouldn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would almost, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis because of us children, too, isn't it, that you can't get a
good lodging?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--people do object to children sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then if children make so much trouble, why do people have 'em?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--because it is a law of nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we don't ask to be born?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what makes it worse with me is that you are not my real mother,
and you needn't have had me unless you liked. I oughtn't to have
come to `ee--that's the real truth! I troubled 'em in Australia,
and I trouble folk here. I wish I hadn't been born!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't help it, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that whenever children be born that are not wanted they
should be killed directly, before their souls come to 'em, and not
allowed to grow big and walk about!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue did not reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was doubtfully pondering how to treat this
too reflective child.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) at last concluded that, so far as circumstances permitted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
would be honest and candid with one who entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) difficulties
like an aged friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is going to be another in our family soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hesitatingly
remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is going to be another baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>The boy jumped up wildly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh God, Mother, you've never
a-sent for another; and such trouble with what you've got!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have, I am sorry to say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>murmured Sue, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes glistening
with suspended tears.

<p/>The boy burst out weeping. <div class="bookquote">``Oh you don't care, you don't care!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
cried in bitter reproach. ``How EVER could you, Mother, be so wicked
and cruel as this, when you needn't have done it till we was better
off, and Father well! To bring us all into MORE trouble! No room
for us, and Father a-forced to go away, and we turned out to-morrow;
and yet you be going to have another of us soon! ... <div class="bookquote">``Tis done o'
purpose!--`tis--`tis!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walked up and down sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Y-you must forgive me, little Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pleaded, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bosom heaving
now as much as the boy's. <div class="bookquote">``I can't explain--I will when you are
older. It does seem--as if I had done it on purpose, now we are in
these difficulties! I can't explain, dear! But it--is not quite on
purpose--I can't help it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes it is--it must be! For nobody would interfere with us, like
that, unless you agreed! I won't forgive you, ever, ever! I'll
never believe you care for me, or Father, or any of us any more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got up, and went away into the closet adjoining her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) room, in which
a bed had been spread on the floor. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) say: <div class="bookquote">``If we
children was gone there'd be no trouble at all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think that, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cried, rather peremptorily. <div class="bookquote">``But go to
sleep!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The following morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) awoke at a little past six, and decided
to get up and run across before breakfast to the inn which Jude had
informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) quarters, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) what had happened before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) arose softly, to avoid disturbing the children,
who, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knew, must be fatigued by their exertions of yesterday.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) found Jude at breakfast in the obscure tavern he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had chosen as a
counterpoise to the expense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lodging: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) homelessness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had been so anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) all night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
said. Somehow, now it was morning, the request to leave the lodgings
did not seem such a depressing incident as it had seemed the night
before, nor did even her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) failure to find another place affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) so
deeply as at first. Jude agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) that it would not be worth
while to insist upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) right to stay a week, but to take immediate
steps for removal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must all come to this inn for a day or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is
a rough place, and it will not be so nice for the children, but we
shall have more time to look round. There are plenty of lodgings in
the suburbs--in my old quarter of Beersheba. Have breakfast with me
now you are here, my bird. You are sure you are well? There will
be plenty of time to get back and prepare the children's meal before
they wake. In fact, I'll go with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) joined Jude in a hasty meal, and in a quarter of an hour they
started together, resolving to clear out from Sue's too respectable
lodging immediately. On reaching the place and going upstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
found that all was quiet in the children's room, and called to the
landlady in timorous tones to please bring up the tea-kettle and
something for their breakfast. This was perfunctorily done, and
producing a couple of eggs which she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) put
them into the boiling kettle, and summoned Jude to watch them for the
youngsters, while she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) went to call them, it being now about half-past
eight o'clock.

<p/>Jude stood bending over the kettle, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand,
timing the eggs, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) back was turned to the little inner
chamber where the children lay. A shriek from Sue suddenly caused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to start round. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw that the door of the room, or rather
closet--which had seemed to go heavily upon its hinges as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pushed
it back--was open, and that Sue had sunk to the floor just within it.
Hastening forward to pick her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) up he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes to the little
bed spread on the boards; no children were there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked in
bewilderment round the room. At the back of the door were fixed
two hooks for hanging garments, and from these the forms of the two
youngest children were suspended, by a piece of box-cord round each
of their necks, while from a nail a few yards off the body of little
Jude was hanging in a similar manner. An overturned chair was near
the elder boy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) glazed eyes were slanted into the room; but
those of the girl and the baby boy were closed.

<p/>Half-paralyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
let Sue lie, cut the cords with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket-knife and threw the three
children on the bed; but the feel of their bodies in the momentary
handling seemed to say that they were dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) caught up Sue, who
was in fainting fits, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) on the bed in the other room, after
which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breathlessly summoned the landlady and ran out for a Doctor.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got back Sue had come to herself, and the two helpless
women, bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them,
and the triplet of little corpses, formed a sight which overthrew
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) self-command. The nearest surgeon came in, but, as Jude had
inferred, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) presence was superfluous. The children were past
saving, for though their bodies were still barely cold it was
conjectured that they had been hanging more than an hour. The
probability held by the parents later on, when they were able to
reason on the case, was that the elder boy, on waking, looked into
the outer room for Sue, and, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) absent, was thrown into a
fit of aggravated despondency that the events and information of the
evening before had induced in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) morbid temperament. Moreover a
piece of paper was found upon the floor, on which was written, in
the boy's hand, with the bit of lead pencil that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) carried:


<p/>_Done because we are too menny._


<p/>At sight of this Sue's nerves utterly gave way, an awful conviction
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the
tragedy, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) into a convulsive agony which knew no
abatement. They carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) away against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wish to a room on the
lower floor; and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lay, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) slight figure shaken with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
gasps, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes staring at the ceiling, the woman of the house
vainly trying to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>They could hear from this chamber the people moving about above, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) implored to be allowed to go back, and was only kept from doing
so by the assurance that, if there were any hope, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) presence might
do harm, and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of
herself lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) should endanger a coming life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) inquiries were
incessant, and at last Jude came down and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) there was no hope.
As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could speak she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had said to the
boy, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) thought herself the cause of this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``It was in his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) nature to do it. The Doctor says
there are such boys springing up amongst us--boys of a sort unknown
in the last generation--the outcome of new views of life. They seem
to see all its terrors before they are old enough to have staying
power to resist them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) says it is the beginning of the coming
universal wish not to live. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'s an advanced man, the Doctor: but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) can give no consolation to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude had kept back his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own grief on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) now
broke down; and this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in
some degree distracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) poignant self-reproach. When
everybody was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was allowed to see the children.

<p/>The boy's face expressed the whole tale of their situation. On
that little shape had converged all the inauspiciousness and shadow
which had darkened the first union of Jude, and all the accidents,
mistakes, fears, errors of the last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was their nodal point, their
focus, their expression in a single term. For the rashness of those
parents he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had groaned, for their ill assortment he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had quaked, and
for the misfortunes of these he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had died.

<p/>When the house was silent, and they could do nothing but await the
coroner's inquest, a subdued, large, low voice spread into the air of
the room from behind the heavy walls at the back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue breathing</b></font>)</div>said Sue, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) spasmodic breathing suspended.

<p/>``The organ of the college chapel. The organist practising I suppose.
It's the anthem from the seventy-third Psalm; <div class="bookquote">``Truly God is loving
unto Israel.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sobbed again. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh my babies! They had done no harm! Why
should they have been taken away, and not I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another stillness--broken at last by two persons in
conversation somewhere without.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are talking about us, no doubt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>moaned Sue. <div class="bookquote">''`We are made a
spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude listened--<div class="bookquote">``No--they are not talking of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They
are two clergymen of different views, arguing about the eastward
position. Good God--the eastward position, and all creation
groaning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then another silence, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was seized with another uncontrollable
fit of grief. ``There is something external to us which says, ``You
shan<div class="bookquote">``t!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>First it said, <div class="bookquote">``You shan't learn!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then it said, <div class="bookquote">``You
shan't labour!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Now it says, <div class="bookquote">``You shan't love!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) tried to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) by saying, <div class="bookquote">``That's bitter of you, darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus they waited, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went back again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) room. The baby's
frock, shoes, and socks, which had been lying on a chair at the time
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) death, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would not now have removed, though Jude would fain
have got them out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sight. But whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) touched them she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to let them lie, and burst out almost savagely at the
woman of the house when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) also attempted to put them away.

<p/>Jude dreaded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dull apathetic silences almost more than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
paroxysms. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you speak to me, Jude?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried out, after
one of these. <div class="bookquote">``Don't turn away from me! I can't BEAR the loneliness
of being out of your looks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, dear; here I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face close to hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes... Oh, my comrade, our perfect union--our two-in-oneness--is
now stained with blood!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shadowed by death--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah; but it was I who incited him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) really, though I didn't know I was
doing it! I talked to the child as one should only talk to people of
mature age. I said the world was against us, that it was better to
be out of life than in it at this price; and he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) took it literally.
And I told him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) I was going to have another child. It upset him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>). Oh
how bitterly he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) upbraided me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you do it, Sue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell. It was that I wanted to be truthful. I couldn't
bear deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) as to the facts of life. And yet I wasn't
truthful, for with a false delicacy I told him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) too obscurely.--Why
was I half-wiser than my fellow-women? And not entirely wiser! Why
didn't I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) pleasant untruths, instead of half-realities? It
was my want of self-control, so that I could neither conceal things
nor reveal them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases; only
in our peculiar case it chanced to work badly perhaps. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) must have
known sooner or later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I was just making my baby darling a new frock; and now I shall
never see him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) in it, and never talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) any more! ... My eyes are
so swollen that I can scarcely see; and yet little more than a year
ago I called myself happy! We went about loving each other too
much--indulging ourselves to utter selfishness with each other! We
said--do you remember?--that we would make a virtue of joy. I said
it was Nature's intention, Nature's law and _raison d'être_ that we
should be joyful in what instincts she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) afforded us--instincts which
civilization had taken upon itself to thwart. What dreadful things I
said! And now Fate has given us this stab in the back for being such
fools as to take Nature at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sank into a quiet contemplation, till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It is best,
perhaps, that they should be gone.--Yes--I see it is! Better that
they should be plucked fresh than stay to wither away miserably!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>replied Jude. <div class="bookquote">``Some say that the elders should rejoice when
their children die in infancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they don't know! ... Oh my babies, my babies, could you be
alive now! You may say the boy wished to be out of life, or he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
wouldn't have done it. It was not unreasonable for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to die: it
was part of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) incurably sad nature, poor little fellow! But then
the others--my OWN children and yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Sue looked at the hanging little frock and at the socks and
shoes; and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure quivered like a string. <div class="bookquote">``I am a pitiable
creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``good neither for earth nor heaven any more!
I am driven out of my mind by things! What ought to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stared at Jude, and tightly held his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing can be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Things are as they are, and will
be brought to their destined issue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``Yes! Who said that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked heavily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It comes in the chorus of the _Agamemnon_. It has been in my mind
continually since this happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor Jude--how you've missed everything!--you more than I, for
I did get you! To think you should know that by your unassisted
reading, and yet be in poverty and despair!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After such momentary diversions her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grief would return in a wave.

<p/>The jury duly came and viewed the bodies, the inquest was held; and
next arrived the melancholy morning of the funeral. Accounts in
the newspapers had brought to the spot curious idlers, who stood
apparently counting the window-panes and the stones of the walls.
Doubt of the real relations of the couple added zest to their
curiosity. Sue had declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would follow the two little
ones to the grave, but at the last moment she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave way, and the
coffins were quietly carried out of the house while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was lying
down. Jude got into the vehicle, and it drove away, much to the
relief of the landlord, who now had only Sue and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) luggage
remaining on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hands, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hoped to be also clear of later on
in the day, and so to have freed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) house from the exasperating
notoriety it had acquired during the week through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife's unlucky
admission of these strangers. In the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) privately
consulted with the owner of the house, and they agreed that if any
objection to it arose from the tragedy which had occurred there they
would try to get its number changed.

<p/>When Jude had seen the two little boxes--one containing little Jude,
and the other the two smallest--deposited in the earth he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hastened
back to Sue, who was still in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) therefore did not
disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) just then. Feeling anxious, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went again
about four o'clock. The woman thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was still lying down, but
returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bedroom after all.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hat and jacket, too, were missing: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had gone out. Jude
hurried off to the public house where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was sleeping. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not
been there. Then bethinking himself of possibilities he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went along
the road to the cemetery, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) entered, and crossed to where the
interments had recently taken place. The idlers who had followed to
the spot by reason of the tragedy were all gone now. A man with a
shovel in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands was attempting to earth in the common grave of
the three children, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm was held back by an expostulating
woman who stood in the half-filled hole. It was Sue, whose coloured
clothing, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had never thought of changing for the mourning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had bought, suggested to the eye a deeper grief than the conventional
garb of bereavement could express.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)'s filling them in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) shan't till I've seen my little ones
again!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cried wildly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) saw Jude. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see them once
more. Oh Jude--please Jude--I want to see them! I didn't know you
would let them be taken away while I was asleep! You said perhaps I
should see them once more before they were screwed down; and then you
didn't, but took them away! Oh Jude, you are cruel to me too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>)'s been wanting me to dig out the grave again, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) get
to the coffins,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man with the spade. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) ought to be took
home, by the look o' her (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) is hardly responsible, poor thing,
seemingly. Can't dig 'em up again now, ma'am. Do ye go home with
your husband, and take it quiet, and thank God that there'll be
another soon to swage yer grief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>But Sue kept asking piteously: <div class="bookquote">``Can't I see them once more--just
once! Can't I? Only just one little minute, Jude? It would not
take long! And I should be so glad, Jude! I will be so good, and
not disobey you ever any more, Jude, if you will let me? I would go
home quietly afterwards, and not want to see them any more! Can't I?
Why can't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went on. Jude was thrown into such acute sorrow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
almost felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would try to get the man to accede. But it could
do no good, and might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) still worse; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw that it
was imperative to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) home at once. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) coaxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and
whispered tenderly, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>); till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) helplessly gave in, and was induced to leave the cemetery.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wished to obtain a fly to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) back in, but economy being so
imperative she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) deprecated his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) doing so, and they walked along slowly,
Jude in black crape, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in brown and red clothing. They were to
have gone to a new lodging that afternoon, but Jude saw that it was
not practicable, and in course of time they entered the now hated
house. Sue was at once got to bed, and the Doctor sent for.

<p/>Jude waited all the evening downstairs. At a very late hour the
intelligence was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) that a child had been prematurely
born, and that it, like the others, was a corpse.



<p/>III


<p/>Sue was convalescent, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had hoped for death, and Jude had
again obtained work at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old trade. They were in other lodgings
now, in the direction of Beersheba, and not far from the Church of
Ceremonies--Saint Silas.

<p/>They would sit silent, more bodeful of the direct antagonism of
things than of their insensate and stolid obstructiveness. Vague
and quaint imaginings had haunted Sue in the days when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) intellect
scintillated like a star, that the world resembled a stanza or melody
composed in a dream; it was wonderfully excellent to the half-aroused
intelligence, but hopelessly absurd at the full waking; that the
First Cause worked automatically like a somnambulist, and not
reflectively like a sage; that at the framing of the terrestrial
conditions there seemed never to have been contemplated such
a development of emotional perceptiveness among the creatures
subject to those conditions as that reached by thinking and
educated humanity. But affliction makes opposing forces loom
anthropomorphous; and those ideas were now exchanged for a sense of
Jude and herself fleeing from a persecutor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must conform!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``All the ancient wrath of
the Power above us has been vented upon us, His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) poor creatures, and
we must submit. There is no choice. We must. It is no use fighting
against God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only against man and senseless circumstance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) murmured. ``What have I been thinking of! I am getting
as superstitious as a savage! ... But whoever or whatever our foe
may be, I am cowed into submission. I have no more fighting strength
left; no more enterprise. I am beaten, beaten! ... ``We are made a
spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!<div class="bookquote">'' I am always
saying that now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel the same!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we do? You are in work now; but remember, it may
only be because our history and relations are not absolutely
known... Possibly, if they knew our marriage had not been formalized they
would turn you out of your job as they did at Aldbrickham!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know. Perhaps they would hardly do that. However, I think
that we ought to make it legal now--as soon as you are able to go
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think we ought?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude</b></font>)</div><p/>And Jude fell into thought. <div class="bookquote">``I have seemed to myself lately,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to belong to that vast band of men shunned by the
virtuous--the men called seducers. It amazes me when I think of it!
I have not been conscious of it, or of any wrongdoing towards you,
whom I love more than myself. Yet I am one of those men! I wonder
if any other of them are the same purblind, simple creatures as
I? ... Yes, Sue--that's what I am. I seduced you... You were a
distinct type--a refined creature, intended by Nature to be left
intact. But I couldn't leave you alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't reproach yourself with
being what you are not. If anybody is to blame it is I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I supported you in your resolve to leave Phillotson; and without me
perhaps you wouldn't have urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) to let you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have, just the same. As to ourselves, the fact of our not
having entered into a legal contract is the saving feature in our
union. We have thereby avoided insulting, as it were, the solemnity
of our first marriages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Solemnity?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>Jude looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with some surprise, and grew
conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not the Sue of their earlier time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, with a little quiver in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``I have had
dreadful fears, a dreadful sense of my own insolence of action.
I have thought--that I am still his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God, dearest!--why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I can't explain! Only the thought comes to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your weakness--a sick fancy, without reason or meaning!
Don't let it trouble you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue sighed uneasily.

<p/>As a set-off against such discussions as these there had come
an improvement in their pecuniary position, which earlier in
their experience would have made them cheerful. Jude had quite
unexpectedly found good employment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old trade almost directly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arrived, the summer weather suiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fragile constitution; and
outwardly his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) days went on with that monotonous uniformity which
is in itself so grateful after vicissitude. People seemed to have
forgotten that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had ever shown any awkward aberrancies, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
daily mounted to the parapets and copings of colleges he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could never
enter, and renewed the crumbling freestones of mullioned windows he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
would never look from, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had known no wish to do otherwise.

<p/>There was this change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not often go to any service
at the churches now. One thing troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) more than any other;
that Sue and himself had mentally travelled in opposite directions
since the tragedy: events which had enlarged his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own views of life,
laws, customs, and dogmas, had not operated in the same manner on
Sue's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was no longer the same as in the independent days, when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) intellect played like lambent lightning over conventions and
formalities which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) at that time respected, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not now.

<p/>On a particular Sunday evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) came in rather late. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was
not at home, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) soon returned, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) silent and
meditative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking of, little woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) asked curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh I can't tell clearly! I have thought that we have been selfish,
careless, even impious, in our courses, you and I. Our life has been
a vain attempt at self-delight. But self-abnegation is the higher
road. We should mortify the flesh--the terrible flesh--the curse of
Adam!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``What has come over you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We ought to be continually sacrificing ourselves on the altar of
duty! But I have always striven to do what has pleased me. I well
deserved the scourging I have got! I wish something would take the
evil right out of me, and all my monstrous errors, and all my sinful
ways!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue--my own too suffering dear!--there's no evil woman in you. Your
natural instincts are perfectly healthy; not quite so impassioned,
perhaps, as I could wish; but good, and dear, and pure. And as I
have often said, you are absolutely the most ethereal, least sensual
woman I ever knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness. Why do you
talk in such a changed way? We have not been selfish, except when no
one could profit by our being otherwise. You used to say that human
nature was noble and long-suffering, not vile and corrupt, and at
last I thought you spoke truly. And now you seem to take such a much
lower view!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want a humble heart; and a chastened mind; and I have never had
them yet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been fearless, both as a thinker and as a feeler, and you
deserved more admiration than I gave. I was too full of narrow
dogmas at that time to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that, Jude! I wish my every fearless word and thought
could be rooted out of my history. Self-renunciation--that's
everything! I cannot humiliate myself too much. I should like to
prick myself all over with pins and bleed out the badness that's in
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) little face against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) breast as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) were an infant. <div class="bookquote">``It is bereavement that has brought you to this!
Such remorse is not for you, my sensitive plant, but for the wicked
ones of the earth--who never feel it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought not to stay like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) murmured, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had remained
in the position a long while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is indulgence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still on the same tack! But is there anything better on earth than
that we should love one another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It depends on the sort of love; and yours--ours--is the
wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't have it, Sue! Come, when do you wish our marriage to be
signed in a vestry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) paused, and looked up uneasily. <div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) whispered.

<p/>Not knowing the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) meaning he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) took the objection serenely,
and said nothing. Several minutes elapsed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
fallen asleep; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) spoke softly, and found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was wide awake
all the time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sat upright and sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a strange, indescribable perfume or atmosphere about you
to-night, Sue,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I mean not only mentally, but about your
clothes, also. A sort of vegetable scent, which I seem to know, yet
cannot remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is incense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Incense?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been to the service at St. Silas', and I was in the fumes of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--St. Silas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I go there sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed. You go there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Jude, it is lonely here in the weekday mornings, when you
are at work, and I think and think of--of my--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) stopped till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
could control the lumpiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``And I have taken to go
in there, as it is so near.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well--of course, I say nothing against it. Only it is odd, for
you. They little think what sort of chiel is amang them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Jude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--a sceptic, to be plain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you pain me so, dear Jude, in my trouble! Yet I know you
didn't mean it. But you ought not to say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't. But I am much surprised!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I want to tell you something else, Jude. You won't be angry,
will you? I have thought of it a good deal since my babies died.
I don't think I ought to be your wife--or as your wife--any longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? ... But you ARE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From your point of view; but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we were afraid of the ceremony, and a good many others
would have been in our places, with such strong reasons for fears.
But experience has proved how we misjudged ourselves, and overrated
our infirmities; and if you are beginning to respect rites and
ceremonies, as you seem to be, I wonder you don't say it shall be
carried out instantly? You certainly ARE my wife, Sue, in all but
law. What do you mean by what you said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not? But suppose we HAD gone through the ceremony? Would you feel
that you were then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I should not feel even then that I was. I should feel worse
than I do now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so--in the name of all that's perverse, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I am Richard's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--you hinted that absurd fancy to me before!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only an impression with me then; I feel more and more
convinced as time goes on that--I belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), or to nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good heavens--how we are changing places!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Perhaps so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the carpenter</b></font>)</div><p/>Some few days later, in the dusk of the summer evening, they were
sitting in the same small room downstairs, when a knock came to the
front door of the carpenter's house where they were lodging, and in a
few moments there was a tap at the door of their room. Before they
could open it the comer did so, and a woman's form appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Fawley here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude and Sue started as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mechanically replied in the affirmative,
for the voice was Arabella's.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) formally requested her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to come in, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sat down in the window
bench, where they could distinctly see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) outline against the light;
but no characteristic that enabled them to estimate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) general
aspect and air. Yet something seemed to denote that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was not
quite so comfortably circumstanced, nor so bouncingly attired, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had been during Cartlett's lifetime.

<p/>The three attempted an awkward conversation about the tragedy, of
which Jude had felt it to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) duty to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) immediately,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had never replied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just come from the cemetery,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I inquired and
found the child's grave. I couldn't come to the funeral--thank you
for inviting me all the same. I read all about it in the papers,
and I felt I wasn't wanted... No--I couldn't come to the funeral,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>repeated Arabella, who, seeming utterly unable to reach the ideal of
a catastrophic manner, fumbled with iterations. <div class="bookquote">``But I am glad I
found the grave. As `tis your trade, Jude, you'll be able to put up
a handsome stone to 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall put up a headstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude drearily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was my child, and naturally I feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so. We all did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The others that weren't mine I didn't feel so much for, as was
natural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>A sigh came from the dark corner where Sue sat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had often wished I had mine with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cartlett/Mrs. Cartlett</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Cartlett.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps `twouldn't have happened then! But of course I didn't wish
to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) away from your wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>came from Sue.

<p/>The unexpectedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) words struck Jude silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I beg your pardon, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you
were!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude had known from the quality of Sue's tone that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) new and
transcendental views lurked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) words; but all except their
obvious meaning was, naturally, missed by Arabella. The latter,
after evincing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was struck by Sue's avowal, recovered
herself, and went on to talk with placid bluntness about <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue/Sue Bridehead/Bridehead</b></font>)</div>boy,
for whom, though in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lifetime she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had shown no care at all,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) now exhibited a ceremonial mournfulness that was apparently
sustaining to the conscience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) alluded to the past, and in making
some remark appealed again to Sue. There was no answer: Sue had
invisibly left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not your wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>resumed Arabella in another voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot inform you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) once told me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't criticize what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--I see! Well, my time is up. I am staying here to-night, and
thought I could do no less than call, after our mutual affliction.
I am sleeping at the place where I used to be barmaid, and to-morrow
I go back to Alfredston. Father is come home again, and I am living
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has returned from Australia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude with languid curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Couldn't get on there. Had a rough time of it. Mother died
of dys--what do you call it--in the hot weather, and Father and two
of the young ones have just got back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has got a cottage near the
old place, and for the present I am keeping house for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude's former wife had maintained a stereotyped manner of strict good
breeding even now that Sue was gone, and limited her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) stay to a number
of minutes that should accord with the highest respectability. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had departed Jude, much relieved, went to the stairs and called
Sue--feeling anxious as to what had become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>There was no answer, and the carpenter who kept the lodgings said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had not come in. Jude was puzzled, and became quite alarmed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
absence, for the hour was growing late. The carpenter called his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>)
wife, who conjectured that Sue might have gone to St. Silas' church,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) often went there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely not at this time o' night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``It is shut.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) knows somebody who keeps the key, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) has it whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
wants it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long has she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) been going on with this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, some few weeks, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude went vaguely in the direction of the church, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had never
once approached since he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lived out that way years before, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
young opinions were more mystical than they were now. The spot was
deserted, but the door was certainly unfastened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lifted the latch
without noise, and pushing to the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), stood absolutely
still inside. The prevalent silence seemed to contain a faint sound,
explicable as a breathing, or a sobbing, which came from the other
end of the building. The floor-cloth deadened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) footsteps as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
moved in that direction through the obscurity, which was broken only
by the faintest reflected night-light from without.

<p/>High overhead, above the chancel steps, Jude could discern a huge,
solidly constructed Latin cross--as large, probably, as the original
it was designed to commemorate. It seemed to be suspended in the
air by invisible wires; it was set with large jewels, which faintly
glimmered in some weak ray caught from outside, as the cross swayed
to and fro in a silent and scarcely perceptible motion. Underneath,
upon the floor, lay what appeared to be a heap of black clothes, and
from this was repeated the sobbing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had heard before. It was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) Sue's form, prostrate on the paving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) whispered.

<p/>Something white disclosed itself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--do you want with me here, Jude?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said almost sharply.
<div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't come! I wanted to be alone! Why did you intrude
here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you ask!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) retorted in quick reproach, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) full heart
was wounded to its centre at this attitude of hers towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Why do I come? Who has a right to come, I should like to know, if
I have not! I, who love you better than my own self--better--far
better--than you have loved me! What made you leave me to come here
alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't criticize me, Jude--I can't bear it!--I have often told
you so. You must take me as I am. I am a wretch--broken by my
distractions! I couldn't BEAR it when Arabella came--I felt so
utterly miserable I had to come away. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) seems to be your wife
still, and Richard to be my husband!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they are nothing to us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear friend, they are. I see marriage differently now. My
babies have been taken from me to show me this! Arabella's child
killing mine was a judgement--the right slaying the wrong. What,
WHAT shall I do! I am such a vile creature--too worthless to mix
with ordinary human beings!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is terrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, verging on tears. <div class="bookquote">``It is monstrous
and unnatural for you to be so remorseful when you have done no
wrong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--you don't know my badness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) returned vehemently: <div class="bookquote">``I do! Every atom and dreg of it! You make
me hate Christianity, or mysticism, or Sacerdotalism, or whatever it
may be called, if it's that which has caused this deterioration in
you. That a woman-poet, a woman-seer, a woman whose soul shone like
a diamond--whom all the wise of the world would have been proud of,
if they could have known you--should degrade herself like this! I am
glad I had nothing to do with Divinity--damn glad--if it's going to
ruin you in this way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are angry, Jude, and unkind to me, and don't see how things

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come along home with me, dearest, and perhaps I shall. I am
overburdened--and you, too, are unhinged just now.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arm
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) and lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>); but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) came, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) preferred to walk
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) support.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't dislike you, Jude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said in a sweet and imploring voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I love you as much as ever! Only--I ought not to love you--any
more. Oh I must not any more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't own it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have made up my mind that I am not your wife! I belong to

alter it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely we are man and wife, if ever two people were in this
world? Nature's own marriage it is, unquestionably!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not Heaven's. Another was made for me there, and ratified
eternally in the church at Melchester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue, Sue--affliction has brought you to this unreasonable state!
After converting me to your views on so many things, to find you
suddenly turn to the right-about like this--for no reason whatever,
confounding all you have formerly said through sentiment merely!
You root out of me what little affection and reverence I had left in
me for the Church as an old acquaintance... What I can't understand
in you is your extraordinary blindness now to your old logic. Is it
peculiar to you, or is it common to woman? Is a woman a thinking
unit at all, or a fraction always wanting its integer? How you
argued that marriage was only a clumsy contract--which it is--how you
showed all the objections to it--all the absurdities! If two and two
made four when we were happy together, surely they make four now? I
can't understand it, I repeat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ah, dear Jude; that's because you are like a totally deaf man
observing people listening to music. You say ``What are they
regarding? Nothing is there.<div class="bookquote">'' But something is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a hard saying from you; and not a true parallel! You threw
off old husks of prejudices, and taught me to do it; and now you go
back upon yourself. I confess I am utterly stultified in my estimate
of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear friend, my only friend, don't be hard with me! I can't help
being as I am, I am convinced I am right--that I see the light at
last. But oh, how to profit by it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked along a few more steps till they were outside the
building and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had returned the key. <div class="bookquote">``Can this be the girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said
Jude when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) came back, feeling a slight renewal of elasticity now
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was in the open street; <div class="bookquote">``can this be the girl who brought
the pagan deities into this most Christian city?--who mimicked Miss
Fontover when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fontover</b></font>) crushed them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fontover</b></font>) heel?--quoted Gibbon, and
Shelley, and Mill? Where are dear Apollo, and dear Venus now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh don't, don't be so cruel to me, Jude, and I so unhappy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
sobbed. <div class="bookquote">``I can't bear it! I was in error--I cannot reason with you.
I was wrong--proud in my own conceit! Arabella's coming was the
finish. Don't satirize me: it cuts like a knife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) passionately there in the
silent street, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). They went on till they
came to a little coffee-house. <div class="bookquote">``Jude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said with suppressed
tears, <div class="bookquote">``would you mind getting a lodging here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will--if, if you really wish? But do you? Let me go to our door
and understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went and conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wanted no supper, and
went in the dark upstairs and struck a light. Turning she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) found that
Jude had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and was standing at the chamber door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and said <div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Sue! Don't we live here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said you would do as I wished!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Very well! ... Perhaps it was wrong of me to argue
distastefully as I have done! Perhaps as we couldn't conscientiously
marry at first in the old-fashioned way, we ought to have parted.
Perhaps the world is not illuminated enough for such experiments as
ours! Who were we, to think we could act as pioneers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad you see that much, at any rate. I never deliberately
meant to do as I did. I slipped into my false position through
jealousy and agitation!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely through love--you loved me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But I wanted to let it stop there, and go on always as mere
lovers; until--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But people in love couldn't live for ever like that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women could: men can't, because they--won't. An average woman is
in this superior to an average man--that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never instigates, only

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was the unhappy cause of the change, as I have said

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I repeat--if either were to blame it was not you but I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--it was I. Your wickedness was only the natural man's desire
to possess the woman. Mine was not the reciprocal wish till envy
stimulated me to oust Arabella. I had thought I ought in charity to
let you approach me--that it was damnably selfish to torture you as
I did my other friend. But I shouldn't have given way if you hadn't
broken me down by making me fear you would go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)... But
don't let us say any more about it! Jude, will you leave me to
myself now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes... But Sue--my wife, as you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) burst out; <div class="bookquote">``my old
reproach to you was, after all, a true one. You have never loved me
as I love you--never--never! Yours is not a passionate heart--your
heart does not burn in a flame! You are, upon the whole, a sort of
fay, or sprite--not a woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At first I did not love you, Jude; that I own. When I first knew
you I merely wanted you to love me. I did not exactly flirt with
you; but that inborn craving which undermines some women's morals
almost more than unbridled passion--the craving to attract and
captivate, regardless of the injury it may do the man--was in me; and
when I found I had caught you, I was frightened. And then--I don't
know how it was--I couldn't bear to let you go--possibly to Arabella
again--and so I got to love you, Jude. But you see, however fondly
it ended, it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart
ache for me without letting mine ache for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now you add to your cruelty by leaving me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--yes! The further I flounder, the more harm I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) with a sudden sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own danger. <div class="bookquote">``Do not
do an immoral thing for moral reasons! You have been my social
salvation. Stay with me for humanity's sake! You know what a weak
fellow I am. My two arch-enemies you know--my weakness for womankind
and my impulse to strong liquor. Don't abandon me to them, Sue, to
save your own soul only! They have been kept entirely at a distance
since you became my guardian-angel! Since I have had you I have been
able to go into any temptations of the sort, without risk. Isn't
my safety worth a little sacrifice of dogmatic principle? I am in
terror lest, if you leave me, it will be with me another case of the
pig that was washed turning back to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wallowing in the mire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue burst out weeping. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, but you must not, Jude! You won't!
I'll pray for you night and day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--never mind; don't grieve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude generously. <div class="bookquote">``I did
suffer, God knows, about you at that time; and now I suffer again.
But perhaps not so much as you. The woman mostly gets the worst of
it in the long run!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is absolutely worthless and contemptible. And this one
is not that, anyhow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue drew a nervous breath or two. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is--I fear! ... Now
Jude--good-night,--please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mustn't stay?--Not just once more? As it has been so many
times--O Sue, my wife, why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--no--not wife! ... I am in your hands, Jude--don't tempt me back
now I have advanced so far!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I do your bidding. I owe that to you, darling, in
penance for how I overruled it at the first time. My God, how
selfish I was! Perhaps--perhaps I spoilt one of the highest and
purest loves that ever existed between man and woman! ... Then let
the veil of our temple be rent in two from this hour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went to the bed, removed one of the pair of pillows thereon, and
flung it to the floor.

<p/>Sue looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and bending over the bed-rail wept silently.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't see that it is a matter of conscience with me, and not
of dislike to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) brokenly murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Dislike to you! But I
can't say any more--it breaks my heart--it will be undoing all I
have begun! Jude--good-night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said, and turned to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh but you shall kiss me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), starting up. <div class="bookquote">``I
can't--bear--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) weeping face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had scarcely ever
done before, and they remained in silence till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,
good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then gently pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) away she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) got free, trying to
mitigate the sadness by saying: <div class="bookquote">``We'll be dear friends just the same,
Jude, won't we? And we'll see each other sometimes--yes!--and forget
all this, and try to be as we were long ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude did not permit himself to speak, but turned and descended the
stairs.



<p/>IV


<p/>The man whom Sue, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) mental _volte-face_, was now regarding as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) inseparable husband, lived still at Marygreen.

<p/>On the day before the tragedy of the children, Phillotson had seen
both her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) and Jude as they stood in the rain at Christminster watching
the procession to the theatre. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had said nothing of it at the
moment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) companion Gillingham, who, being an old friend, was
staying with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at the village aforesaid, and had, indeed, suggested
the day's trip to Christminster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Gillingham, as they went home. <div class="bookquote">``The
university degree you never obtained?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson gruffly. <div class="bookquote">``Of somebody I saw to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In a
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Susanna.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Susanna</b></font>), too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I didn't wish to draw your attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susanna</b></font>). But, as you did see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Susanna</b></font>), you should have said: <div class="bookquote">``How d'ye do, my dear-that-was?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well. I might have. But what do you think of this: I have good
reason for supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susanna</b></font>) was innocent when I divorced her (<font color='blue'><b>Susanna</b></font>)--that
I was all wrong. Yes, indeed! Awkward, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Susanna</b></font>) has taken care to set you right since, anyhow, apparently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm. That's a cheap sneer. I ought to have waited, unquestionably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div><p/>At the end of the week, when Gillingham had gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) school
near Shaston, Phillotson, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) custom, went to Alfredston
market; ruminating again on Arabella's intelligence as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) walked down
the long hill which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had known before Jude knew it, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
history had not beaten so intensely upon its incline. Arrived in
the town he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) usual weekly local paper; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had sat
down in an inn to refresh himself for the five miles' walk back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
pulled the paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pocket and read awhile. The account of the
<div class="bookquote">``strange suicide of a stone-mason's children''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>met his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Unimpassioned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was, it impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) painfully, and puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
not a little, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not understand the age of the elder child
being what it was stated to be. However, there was no doubt that the
newspaper report was in some way true.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Their cup of sorrow is now full!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said: and thought and thought
of Sue, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had gained by leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>Arabella having made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) home at Alfredston, and the schoolmaster
coming to market there every Saturday, it was not wonderful that in
a few weeks they met again--the precise time being just after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
return from Christminster, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had stayed much longer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
had at first intended, keeping an interested eye on Jude, though Jude
had seen no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). Phillotson was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) way homeward when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
encountered Arabella, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was approaching the town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like walking out this way, Mrs. Cartlett?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just begun to again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``It is where I lived
as maid and wife, and all the past things of my life that are
interesting to my feelings are mixed up with this road. And they
have been stirred up in me too, lately; for I've been visiting at
Christminster. Yes; I've seen Jude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! How do they bear their terrible affliction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a ve-ry strange way--ve-ry strange! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) don't live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) any
longer. I only heard of it as a certainty just before I left; though
I had thought things were drifting that way from their manner when I
called on them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not live with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband? Why, I should have thought `twould have
united them more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s not her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, after all. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has never really married him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
although they have passed as man and wife so long. And now, instead
of this sad event making 'em hurry up, and get the thing done
legally, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s took in a queer religious way, just as I was in my
affliction at losing Cartlett, only hers is of a more `sterical sort
than mine. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) says, so I was told, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>)'s your wife in the
eye of Heaven and the Church--yours only; and can't be anybody else's
by any act of man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--indeed? ... Separated, have they!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, the eldest boy was mine--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, poor little fellow--born in lawful wedlock, thank God. And
perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) feels, over and above other things, that I ought to have
been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) place. I can't say. However, as for me, I am soon off
from here. I've got Father to look after now, and we can't live in
such a hum-drum place as this. I hope soon to be in a bar again at
Christminster, or some other big town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They parted. When Phillotson had ascended the hill a few steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
stopped, hastened back, and called her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is, or was, their address?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella gave it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Good afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella smiled grimly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) way, and practised
dimple-making all along the road from where the pollard willows begin
to the old almshouses in the first street of the town.

<p/>Meanwhile Phillotson ascended to Marygreen, and for the first time
during a lengthened period he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) lived with a forward eye. On crossing
under the large trees of the green to the humble schoolhouse to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had been reduced he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) stood a moment, and pictured Sue coming out of
the door to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). No man had ever suffered more inconvenience
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own charity, Christian or heathen, than Phillotson had done
in letting Sue go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had been knocked about from pillar to post at
the hands of the virtuous almost beyond endurance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had been nearly
starved, and was now dependent entirely upon the very small stipend
from the school of this village -LRB-where the parson had got ill-spoken
of for befriending him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had often thought of Arabella's remarks
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) should have been more severe with Sue, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) recalcitrant
spirit would soon have been broken. Yet such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) obstinate and
illogical disregard of opinion, and of the principles in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had
been trained, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) convictions on the rightness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) course
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) wife had not been disturbed.

<p/>Principles which could be subverted by feeling in one direction were
liable to the same catastrophe in another. The instincts which had
allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) to give Sue her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liberty now enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
as none the worse for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life with Jude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wished for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) still,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) curious way, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and, apart from policy,
soon felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would be gratified to have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), always
provided that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came willingly.

<p/>But artifice was necessary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had found, for stemming the cold and
inhumane blast of the world's contempt. And here were the materials
ready made. By getting Sue back and remarrying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) on the
respectable plea of having entertained erroneous views of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and
gained his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) divorce wrongfully, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) might acquire some comfort, resume
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old courses, perhaps return to the Shaston school, if not even to
the Church as a licentiate.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would write to Gillingham to inquire his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) views, and
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), Phillotson's, sending a letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
Gillingham replied, naturally, that now she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was gone it were best to
let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) be, and considered that if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were anybody's wife she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
the wife of the man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had borne three children and owed
such tragical adventures. Probably, as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed
unusually strong, the singular pair would make their union legal in
course of time, and all would be well, and decent, and in order.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But they won't--Sue won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Phillotson to himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Gillingham is so matter of fact. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>)'s affected by Christminster
sentiment and teaching. I can see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) views on the indissolubility
of marriage well enough, and I know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) got them. They are not
mine; but I shall make use of them to further mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) wrote a brief reply to Gillingham. <div class="bookquote">``I know I am entirely wrong,
but I don't agree with you. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) having lived with and had
three children by him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), my feeling is -LRB-though I can advance no logical
or moral defence of it, on the old lines-RRB- that it has done little
more than finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>) education. I shall write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cartlett</b></font>), and learn
whether what that woman said is true or no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) mind to do this before he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
friend, there had not been much reason for writing to the latter at
all. However, it was Phillotson's way to act thus.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) accordingly addressed a carefully considered epistle to Sue, and,
knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) emotional temperament, threw a Rhadamanthine strictness
into the lines here and there, carefully hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) heterodox
feelings, not to frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) stated that, it having come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
knowledge that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) views had considerably changed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) felt compelled
to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) own, too, were largely modified by events subsequent
to their parting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) would not conceal from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that passionate
love had little to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) communication. It arose from a wish
to make their lives, if not a success, at least no such disastrous
failure as they threatened to become, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) acting on what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had considered at the time a principle of justice, charity, and
reason.

<p/>To indulge one's instinctive and uncontrolled sense of justice and
right, was not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had found, permitted with impunity in an old
civilization like ours. It was necessary to act under an acquired
and cultivated sense of the same, if you wished to enjoy an average
share of comfort and honour; and to let crude loving kindness take
care of itself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) should come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) there at Marygreen.

<p/>On second thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) took out the last paragraph but one; and having
rewritten the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) dispatched it immediately, and in some
excitement awaited the issue.



<p/>A few days after a figure moved through the white fog which enveloped
the Beersheba suburb of Christminster, towards the quarter in which
Jude Fawley had taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) lodging since his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) division from Sue. A
timid knock sounded upon the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) abode.

<p/>It was evening--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) was at home; and by a species of divination he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)
jumped up and rushed to the door himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come out with me? I would rather not come in. I want
to--to talk with you--and to go with you to the cemetery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div><p/>It had been in the trembling accents of Sue that these words came.
Jude put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``It is dreary for you to be out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``But if you prefer not to come in, I don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I do. I shall not keep you long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude was too much affected to go on talking at first; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), too, was
now such a mere cluster of nerves that all initiatory power seemed
to have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and they proceeded through the fog like Acherontic
shades for a long while, without sound or gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) presently said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) voice now quick, now
slow, <div class="bookquote">``so that you may not hear of it by chance. I am going back to
Richard. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) has--so magnanimously--agreed to forgive all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going back? How can you go--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is going to marry me again. That is for form's sake, and to
satisfy the world, which does not see things as they are. But of
course I AM his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wife already. Nothing has changed that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) with an anguish that was well-nigh fierce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are MY wife! Yes, you are. You know it. I have always
regretted that feint of ours in going away and pretending to come
back legally married, to save appearances. I loved you, and you
loved me; and we closed with each other; and that made the marriage.
We still love--you as well as I--KNOW it, Sue! Therefore our
marriage is not cancelled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I know how you see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) answered with despairing
self-suppression. <div class="bookquote">``But I am going to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) again, as it would
be called by you. Strictly speaking you, too--don't mind my saying
it, Jude!--you should take back--Arabella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should? Good God--what next! But how if you and I had married
legally, as we were on the point of doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have felt just the same--that ours was not a marriage.
And I would go back to Richard without repeating the sacrament, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked me. But `the world and its ways have a certain worth' -LRB-I
suppose-RRB-, therefore I concede a repetition of the ceremony... Don't
crush all the life out of me by satire and argument, I implore you!
I was strongest once, I know, and perhaps I treated you cruelly.
But Jude, return good for evil! I am the weaker now. Don't
retaliate upon me, but be kind. Oh be kind to me--a poor wicked
woman who is trying to mend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head hopelessly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes wet. The blow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
bereavement seemed to have destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) reasoning faculty. The once
keen vision was dimmed. <div class="bookquote">``All wrong, all wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said huskily.
<div class="bookquote">``Error--perversity! It drives me out of my senses. Do you care for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)? Do you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)? You know you don't! It will be a fanatic
prostitution--God forgive me, yes--that's what it will be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--I must, must, own it, in deepest remorse! But I
shall try to learn to love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) by obeying him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude argued, urged, implored; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) conviction was proof against
all. It seemed to be the one thing on earth on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was firm,
and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) firmness in this had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) tottering in every other
impulse and wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) possessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been considerate enough to let you know the whole truth,
and to tell it you myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said in cut tones; <div class="bookquote">``that you might
not consider yourself slighted by hearing of it at second hand. I
have even owned the extreme fact that I do not love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I did not
think you would be so rough with me for doing so! I was going to
ask you...''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To give you away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. To send--my boxes to me--if you would. But I suppose you
won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course I will. What--isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) coming to fetch you--to marry
you from here? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) won't condescend to do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I go to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voluntarily, just as I went away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). We are to be married at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) little church at Marygreen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was so sadly sweet in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wrong-headedness that
Jude could not help being moved to tears more than once for pity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I never knew such a woman for doing impulsive penances, as
you, Sue! No sooner does one expect you to go straight on, as the
one rational proceeding, than you double round the corner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well; let that go! ... Jude, I must say good-bye! But I wanted
you to go to the cemetery with me. Let our farewell be there--beside
the graves of those who died to bring home to me the error of my
views.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They turned in the direction of the place, and the gate was opened to
them on application. Sue had been there often, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knew the way
to the spot in the dark. They reached it, and stood still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is here--I should like to part,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Don't think me hard because I have acted on conviction. Your
generous devotion to me is unparalleled, Jude! Your worldly failure,
if you have failed, is to your credit rather than to your blame.

themselves no worldly good. Every successful man is more or less a
selfish man. The devoted fail... <div class="bookquote">``Charity seeketh not her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my mistaken wife. Good-bye!''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>V


<p/>The next afternoon the familiar Christminster fog still hung over all
things. Sue's slim shape was only just discernible going towards the
station.

<p/>Jude had no heart to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) work that day. Neither could he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) go
anywhere in the direction by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would be likely to pass.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went in an opposite one, to a dreary, strange, flat scene, where
boughs dripped, and coughs and consumption lurked, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
never been before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue's gone from me--gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured miserably.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) in the meantime had left by the train, and reached Alfredston
Road, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) entered the steam-tram and was conveyed into the
town. It had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) request to Phillotson that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) should not meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) voluntarily, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) very
house and hearthstone.

<p/>It was Friday evening, which had been chosen because the schoolmaster
was disengaged at four o'clock that day till the Monday morning
following. The little car she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hired at the Bear to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to
Marygreen set her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) down at the end of the lane, half a mile from the
village, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) desire, and preceded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to the schoolhouse with
such portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) luggage as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had brought. On its return she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
encountered it, and asked the driver if he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had found the master's
house open. The man informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) things
had been taken in by the schoolmaster himself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could now enter Marygreen without exciting much observation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) crossed by the well and under the trees to the pretty new school
on the other side, and lifted the latch of the dwelling without
knocking. Phillotson stood in the middle of the room, awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>),
as requested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come, Richard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), looking pale and shaken, and sinking
into a chair. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot believe--you forgive your--wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything, darling Susanna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) started at the endearment, though it had been spoken advisedly
without fervour. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) nerved herself again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My children--are dead--and it is right that they should be! I am
glad--almost. They were sin-begotten. They were sacrificed to teach
me how to live! Their death was the first stage of my purification.
That's why they have not died in vain! ... You will take me back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was so stirred by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pitiful words and tone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) did more than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had meant to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) bent and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cheek.

<p/>Sue imperceptibly shrank away, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) flesh quivering under the touch of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) lips.

<p/>Phillotson's heart sank, for desire was renascent in him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You still
have an aversion to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, dear--I have been driving through the damp, and I was
chilly!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, with a hurried smile of apprehension. <div class="bookquote">``When are
we going to have the marriage? Soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow morning, early, I thought--if you really wish. I am
sending round to the vicar to let him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) know you are come. I have told
him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) highly approves--he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) says it will bring our lives to
a triumphant and satisfactory issue. But--are you sure of yourself?
It is not too late to refuse now if--you think you can't bring
yourself to it, you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I can! I want it done quick. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>), tell him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) at once!
My strength is tried by the undertaking--I can't wait long!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have something to eat and drink then, and go over to your room
at Mrs. Edlin's. I'll tell the vicar half-past eight to-morrow,
before anybody is about--if that's not too soon for you? My friend
Gillingham is here to help us in the ceremony. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s been good enough
to come all the way from Shaston at great inconvenience to himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Unlike a woman in ordinary, whose eye is so keen for material things,
Sue seemed to see nothing of the room they were in, or any detail of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) environment. But on moving across the parlour to put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
muff she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) uttered a little <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and grew paler than before. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) look
was that of the condemned criminal who catches sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) coffin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson.

<p/>The flap of the bureau chanced to be open, and in placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) muff
upon it her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eye had caught a document which lay there. <div class="bookquote">``Oh--only
a--funny surprise!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, trying to laugh away her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) cry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
came back to the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson. <div class="bookquote">``The licence... It has just come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gillingham</b></font>)</div><p/>Gillingham now joined them from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) room above, and Sue nervously
made herself agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) by talking on whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) thought
likely to interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), except herself, though that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
most of all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) obediently ate some supper, and prepared to leave
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lodging hard by. Phillotson crossed the green with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>),
bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) good-night at Mrs. Edlin's door.

<p/>The old woman accompanied Sue to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) temporary quarters, and helped
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to unpack. Among other things she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laid out a night-gown
tastefully embroidered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I didn't know THAT was put in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
mean it to be. Here is a different one.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) handed a new and
absolutely plain garment, of coarse and unbleached calico.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But this is the prettiest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edlin/Edlin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edlin. <div class="bookquote">``That one is no better
than very sackcloth o' Scripture!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I meant it to be. Give me the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) took it, and began rending it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) might, the tears
resounding through the house like a screech-owl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my dear, dear!--whatever...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is adulterous! It signifies what I don't feel--I bought it long
ago--to please Jude. It must be destroyed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edlin/Edlin</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Edlin lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) hands, and Sue excitedly continued to tear the
linen into strips, laying the pieces in the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You med ha' give it to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow. <div class="bookquote">``It do make my heart
ache to see such pretty open-work as that a-burned by the flames--not
that ornamental night-rails can be much use to a' ould `ooman like I.
My days for such be all past and gone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an accursed thing--it reminds me of what I want to forget!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sue repeated. <div class="bookquote">``It is only fit for the fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, you be too strict! What do ye use such words for, and condemn
to hell your dear little innocent children that's lost to `ee! Upon
my life I don't call that religion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue flung her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) face upon the bed, sobbing. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't, don't! That
kills me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) remained shaken with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) grief, and slipped down upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell `ee what--you ought not to marry this man again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edlin/Edlin</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Edlin indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``You are in love wi' t' other still!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I must--I am his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) already!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshoo! You be t' other man's. If you didn't like to commit

concerned nobody but your own two selves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll have me back, and I'm bound to go! If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had

But--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) face in the bed-clothes, and Mrs. Edlin
left the room.

<p/>Phillotson in the interval had gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend Gillingham,
who still sat over the supper-table. They soon rose, and walked out
on the green to smoke awhile. A light was burning in Sue's room, a
shadow moving now and then across the blind.

<p/>Gillingham had evidently been impressed with the indefinable charm of
Sue, and after a silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Well: you've all but got her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) again
at last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) can't very well go a second time. The pear has dropped
into your hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! ... I suppose I am right in taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) word. I confess
there seems a touch of selfishness in it. Apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) being what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is, of course, a luxury for a fogey like me, it will set me right
in the eyes of the clergy and orthodox laity, who have never forgiven
me for letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) go. So I may get back in some degree into my old
track.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--if you've got any sound reason for marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) again, do it
now in God's name! I was always against your opening the cage-door
and letting the bird go in such an obviously suicidal way. You might
have been a school inspector by this time, or a reverend, if you
hadn't been so weak about her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did myself irreparable damage--I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once you've got her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) housed again, stick to her (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>Phillotson was more evasive to-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) did not care to admit
clearly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) taking Sue to him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) again had at bottom nothing to
do with repentance of letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) go, but was, primarily, a human
instinct flying in the face of custom and profession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Yes--I shall do that. I know woman better now. Whatever justice
there was in releasing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), there was little logic, for one holding
my views on other subjects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Gillingham looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>), and wondered whether it would ever happen
that the reactionary spirit induced by the world's sneers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) own
physical wishes would make Phillotson more orthodoxly cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) had erstwhile been informally and perversely kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I perceive it won't do to give way to impulse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>Phillotson resumed,
feeling more and more every minute the necessity of acting up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>)
position. <div class="bookquote">``I flew in the face of the Church's teaching; but I did it
without malice prepense. Women are so strange in their influence
that they tempt you to misplaced kindness. However, I know myself
better now. A little judicious severity, perhaps...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but you must tighten the reins by degrees only. Don't be too
strenuous at first. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll come to any terms in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>The caution was unnecessary, though Phillotson did not say so. ``I
remember what my vicar at Shaston said, when I left after the row
that was made about my agreeing to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) elopement. ``The only thing
you can do to retrieve your position and hers is to admit your error
in not restraining her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with a wise and strong hand, and to get her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
back again if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll come, and be firm in the future.<div class="bookquote">'' But I was
so headstrong at that time that I paid no heed. And that after the
divorce she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) should have thought of doing so I did not dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The gate of Mrs. Edlin's cottage clicked, and somebody began crossing
in the direction of the school. Phillotson said <div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, is that Mr. Phillotson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edlin/Edlin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edlin. <div class="bookquote">``I was going over
to see `ee. I've been upstairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), helping her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to unpack her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
things; and upon my word, sir, I don't think this ought to be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--the wedding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s forcing herself to it, poor dear little thing; and
you've no notion what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s suffering. I was never much for religion
nor against it, but it can't be right to let her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) do this, and you
ought to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) out of it. Of course everybody will say it was
very good and forgiving of `ee to take her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to `ee again. But for my
part I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wish, and I am willing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson with grave
reserve, opposition making him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) illogically tenacious now. <div class="bookquote">``A great
piece of laxity will be rectified.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife if anybody's. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s had three
children by him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dearly; and it's a wicked shame to
egg her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) on to this, poor little quivering thing! She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s got nobody
on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) side. The one man who'd be her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) friend the obstinate creature
won't allow to come near her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). What first put her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) into this mood o'
mind, I wonder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell. Not I certainly. It is all voluntary on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) part.
Now that's all I have to say.''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>Phillotson spoke stiffly. <div class="bookquote">``You've
turned round, Mrs. Edlin. It is unseemly of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I knowed you'd be affronted at what I had to say; but I don't
mind that. The truth's the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not affronted, Mrs. Edlin. You've been too kind a neighbour
for that. But I must be allowed to know what's best for myself and
Susanna. I suppose you won't go to church with us, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Be hanged if I can... I don't know what the times be coming
to! Matrimony have growed to be that serious in these days that one
really do feel afeard to move in it at all. In my time we took it
more careless; and I don't know that we was any the worse for it!
When I and my poor man were jined in it we kept up the junketing all
the week, and drunk the parish dry, and had to borrow half a crown
to begin housekeeping!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edlin/Edlin</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mrs. Edlin had gone back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) cottage Phillotson spoke
moodily. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether I ought to do it--at any rate quite
so rapidly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is really compelling herself to this against her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
instincts--merely from this new sense of duty or religion--I ought
perhaps to let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wait a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you've got so far you ought not to back out of it. That's my
opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't very well put it off now; that's true. But I had a qualm
when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gave that little cry at sight of the licence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, never you have qualms, old boy. I mean to give her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away
to-morrow morning, and you mean to take her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). It has always been on
my conscience that I didn't urge more objections to your letting her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
go, and now we've got to this stage I shan't be content if I don't
help you to set the matter right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>Phillotson nodded, and seeing how staunch his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) friend was, became
more frank. <div class="bookquote">``No doubt when it gets known what I've done I shall
be thought a soft fool by many. But they don't know Sue as I do.
Though so elusive, hers is such an honest nature at bottom that I
don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has ever done anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) conscience. The
fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) having lived with Fawley goes for nothing. At the time
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) left me for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was quite within her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) right. Now
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thinks otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The next morning came, and the self-sacrifice of the woman on the
altar of what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was pleased to call her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) principles was acquiesced
in by these two friends, each from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) own point of view. Phillotson
went across to the Widow Edlin's to fetch Sue a few minutes after
eight o'clock. The fog of the previous day or two on the low-lands
had travelled up here by now, and the trees on the green caught
armfuls, and turned them into showers of big drops. The bride was
waiting, ready; bonnet and all on. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) life looked
so much like the lily her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) name connoted as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) did in that pallid
morning light. Chastened, world-weary, remorseful, the strain on her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
nerves had preyed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) flesh and bones, and she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) appeared smaller
in outline than she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had formerly done, though Sue had not been a
large woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) days of rudest health.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prompt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the schoolmaster</b></font>)</div>said the schoolmaster, magnanimously taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hand.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) checked his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) impulse to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) start of
yesterday, which unpleasantly lingered in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mind.

<p/>Gillingham joined them, and they left the house, Widow Edlin
continuing steadfast in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) refusal to assist in the ceremony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the church?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had not lived there for any
length of time since the old church was pulled down, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
preoccupation forgot the new one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Up here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>said Phillotson; and presently the tower loomed large and
solemn in the fog. The vicar had already crossed to the building,
and when they entered he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) said pleasantly: <div class="bookquote">``We almost want candles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do--wish me to be yours, Richard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>gasped Sue in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, dear; above all things in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue said no more; and for the second or third time he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) was not
quite following out the humane instinct which had induced him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) to let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) go.

<p/>There they stood, five altogether: the parson, the clerk, the couple,
and Gillingham; and the holy ordinance was resolemnized forthwith.
In the nave of the edifice were two or three villagers, and when the
clergyman came to the words, <div class="bookquote">``What God hath joined,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>a woman's voice
from among these was heard to utter audibly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God hath jined indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>It was like a re-enactment by the ghosts of their former selves of
the similar scene which had taken place at Melchester years before.
When the books were signed the vicar congratulated the husband
and wife on having performed a noble, and righteous, and mutually
forgiving act. <div class="bookquote">``All's well that ends well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) said smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``May you long be happy together, after thus having been `saved as by
fire.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They came down the nearly empty building, and crossed to the
schoolhouse. Gillingham wanted to get home that night, and left
early. He (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>), too, congratulated the couple. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) said in parting
from Phillotson, who walked out a little way, ``I shall be able to
tell the people in your native place a good round tale; and they'll
all say ``Well done,<div class="bookquote">'' depend on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div><p/>When the schoolmaster got back Sue was making a pretence of doing
some housewifery as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lived there. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed timid at his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>)
approach, and compunction wrought on him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) at sight of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, my dear, I shan't expect to intrude upon your personal
privacy any more than I did before,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) said gravely. <div class="bookquote">``It is for our
good socially to do this, and that's its justification, if it was not
my reason.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sue brightened a little.



<p/>VI


<p/>The place was the door of Jude's lodging in the out-skirts of
Christminster--far from the precincts of St. Silas' where he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) had
formerly lived, which saddened him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) to sickness. The rain was coming
down. A woman in shabby black stood on the doorstep talking to Jude,
who held the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hand.

<p/>``I am lonely, destitute, and houseless--that's what I am! Father has
turned me out of doors after borrowing every penny I'd got, to put it
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) business, and then accusing me of laziness when I was only
waiting for a situation. I am at the mercy of the world! If you
can't take me and help me, Jude, I must go to the workhouse, or to
something worse. Only just now two undergraduates winked at me as I
came along. <div class="bookquote">``Tis hard for a woman to keep virtuous where there's so
many young men!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman in the rain who spoke thus was Arabella, the evening being
that of the day after Sue's remarriage with Phillotson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for you, but I am only in lodgings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you turn me away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you enough to get food and lodging for a few days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but can't you have the kindness to take me in? I cannot endure
going to a public house to lodge; and I am so lonely. Please, Jude,
for old times' sake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude hastily. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be reminded of those
things; and if you talk about them I shall not help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I suppose I must go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head against
the doorpost and began sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The house is full,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``And I have only a little extra room
to my own--not much more than a closet--where I keep my tools, and
templates, and the few books I have left!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be a palace for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no bedstead in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A bit of a bed could be made on the floor. It would be good enough
for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Unable to be harsh with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and not knowing what to do, Jude called
the man who let the lodgings, and said this was an acquaintance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in great distress for want of temporary shelter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may remember me as barmaid at the Lamb and Flag formerly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>spoke
up Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``My father has insulted me this afternoon, and I've
left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), though without a penny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The householder</b></font>)</div><p/>The householder said he (<font color='blue'><b>householder</b></font>) could not recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) features. <div class="bookquote">``But still,
if you are a friend of Mr. Fawley's we'll do what we can for a day
or two--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)'ll make himself answerable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) has really taken me quite unawares; but
I should wish to help her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) difficulty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>And an arrangement
was ultimately come to under which a bed was to be thrown down in
Jude's lumber-room, to make it comfortable for Arabella till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
could get out of the strait she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was in--not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own fault, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
declared--and return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) father's again.

<p/>While they were waiting for this to be done Arabella said: <div class="bookquote">``You know
the news, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess what you mean; but I know nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a letter from Anny at Alfredston to-day. She (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) had just heard
that the wedding was to be yesterday: but she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) didn't know if it had
come off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to talk of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no: of course you don't. Only it shows what kind of woman--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) I say! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a fool! And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s an angel, too,
poor dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it's done, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)'ll have a chance of getting back to his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) old
position, by everybody's account, so Anny says. All his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) well-wishers
will be pleased, including the bishop himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do spare me, Arabella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella was duly installed in the little attic, and at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
did not come near Jude at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) went to and fro about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own
business, which, when they met for a moment on the stairs or in the
passage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was that of obtaining another place in
the occupation she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) understood best. When Jude suggested London as
affording the most likely opening in the liquor trade, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
head. <div class="bookquote">``No--the temptations are too many,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Any humble
tavern in the country before that for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On the Sunday morning following, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) breakfasted later than on
other days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) meekly asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) might come in to breakfast
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) teapot, and could not replace it
immediately, the shops being shut.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said indifferently.

<p/>While they sat without speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) suddenly observed: <div class="bookquote">``You seem all
in a brood, old man. I'm sorry for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am all in a brood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is about her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), I know. It's no business of mine, but I could find
out all about the wedding--if it really did take place--if you wanted
to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to go to Alfredston to get a few things I left there. And
I could see Anny, who'll be sure to have heard all about it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
has friends at Marygreen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude could not bear to acquiesce in this proposal; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) suspense
pitted itself against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) discretion, and won in the struggle. <div class="bookquote">``You
can ask about it if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I've not heard a sound from
there. It must have been very private, if--they have married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I haven't enough cash to take me there and back, or I
should have gone before. I must wait till I have earned some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I can pay the journey for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said impatiently. And thus
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) suspense as to Sue's welfare, and the possible marriage, moved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to dispatch for intelligence the last emissary he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would have
thought of choosing deliberately.

<p/>Arabella went, Jude requesting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to be home not later than by
the seven o'clock train. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Why should I
have charged her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) to be back by a particular time! She (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)'s nothing to
me--nor the other neither!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But having finished work he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could not help going to the station to
meet Arabella, dragged thither by feverish haste to get the news
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) might bring, and know the worst. Arabella had made dimples
most successfully all the way home, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) stepped out of the
railway carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) merely said <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>with the very
reverse of a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--of course they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) observed, however, the
hard strain upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) lip as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anny says she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) has heard from Belinda, her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) relation out at Marygreen,
that it was very sad, and curious!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean sad? She (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) wanted to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) again, didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)?
And he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--that was it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) wanted to in one sense, but not in the
other. Mrs. Edlin was much upset by it all, and spoke out her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) mind
at Phillotson. But Sue was that excited about it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) burnt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
best embroidery that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)'d worn with you, to blot you out entirely.
Well--if a woman feels like it, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to do it. I commend her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
for it, though others don't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>Arabella sighed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
only husband, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belonged to nobody else in the sight of
God A'mighty while he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lived. Perhaps another woman feels the same
about herself, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>Arabella sighed again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want any cant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't cant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``I feel exactly the same as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) closed that issue by remarking abruptly: <div class="bookquote">``Well--now I know all I
wanted to know. Many thanks for your information. I am not going
back to my lodgings just yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) straightway.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) misery and depression Jude walked to well-nigh every spot
in the city that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had visited with Sue; thence he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) did not know
whither, and then thought of going home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) usual evening meal.
But having all the vices of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) virtues, and some to spare, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) turned
into a public house, for the first time during many months. Among
the possible consequences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) marriage Sue had not dwelt on this.

<p/>Arabella, meanwhile, had gone back. The evening passed, and Jude
did not return. At half-past nine Arabella herself went out, first
proceeding to an outlying district near the river where her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) father
lived, and had opened a small and precarious pork-shop lately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for all your rowing me that night, I've
called in, for I have something to tell you. I think I shall get
married and settled again. Only you must help me: and you can do
no less, after what I've stood `ee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do anything to get thee off my hands!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I am now going to look for my young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s on the
loose I'm afraid, and I must get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home. All I want you to do
to-night is not to fasten the door, in case I should want to sleep
here, and should be late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd soon get tired of giving yourself airs and keeping
away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--don't do the door. That's all I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) then sallied out again, and first hastening back to Jude's to
make sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had not returned, began her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) search for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). A
shrewd guess as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) probable course took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) straight to the
tavern which Jude had formerly frequented, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had been
barmaid for a brief term. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had no sooner opened the door of the
<div class="bookquote">``Private Bar''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eyes fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)--sitting in the shade at
the back of the compartment, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes fixed on the floor in a
blank stare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was drinking nothing stronger than ale just then.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) entered and sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>Jude looked up, and said without surprise: <div class="bookquote">``You've come to have
something, Arabella? ... I'm trying to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): that's all! But
I can't; and I am going home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was a little way on
in liquor, but only a little as yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come entirely to look for you, dear boy. You are not well.
Now you must have something better than that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>Arabella held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
finger to the barmaid. <div class="bookquote">``You shall have a liqueur--that's better fit
for a man of education than beer. You shall have maraschino, or
curaçao dry or sweet, or cherry brandy. I'll treat you, poor chap!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care which! Say cherry brandy... Sue has served me badly,
very badly. I didn't expect it of Sue! I stuck to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
ought to have stuck to me. I'd have sold my soul for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) sake, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) wouldn't risk hers a jot for me. To save her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) own soul she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) lets
mine go damn! ... But it isn't her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) fault, poor little girl--I am
sure it isn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>How Arabella had obtained money did not appear, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) ordered a
liqueur each, and paid for them. When they had drunk these Arabella
suggested another; and Jude had the pleasure of being, as it were,
personally conducted through the varieties of spirituous delectation
by one who knew the landmarks well. Arabella kept very considerably
in the rear of Jude; but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) only sipped where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) drank, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
took as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) could safely take without losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head--which
was not a little, as the crimson upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) countenance showed.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) tone towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to-night was uniformly soothing and cajoling;
and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``I don't care what happens to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
did continually, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``But I do very much!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The closing hour
came, and they were compelled to turn out; whereupon Arabella put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) waist, and guided his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) unsteady footsteps.

<p/>When they were in the streets she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what our
landlord will say to my bringing you home in this state. I expect we
are fastened out, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)'ll have to come down and let us in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the worst of not having a home of your own. I tell you,
Jude, what we had best do. Come round to my father's--I made it up
with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a bit to-day. I can let you in, and nobody will see you at
all; and by to-morrow morning you'll be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything--anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>replied Jude. <div class="bookquote">``What the devil does it matter
to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>any couple</b></font>)</div><p/>They went along together, like any other fuddling couple, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) arm
still round his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) waist, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), at last, round hers; though with no
amatory intent; but merely because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was weary, unstable, and in
need of support.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This--is th' Martyrs'--burning-place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stammered as they
dragged across a broad street. ``I remember--in old Fuller's _Holy
State_--and I am reminded of it--by our passing by here--old Fuller
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fuller</b></font>) _Holy State_ says, that at the burning of Ridley, Doctor
Smith--preached sermon, and took as his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) text _``Though I give my body
to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.<div class="bookquote">''_--Often
think of it as I pass here. Ridley was a--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Exactly. Very thoughtful of you, deary, even though it hasn't
much to do with our present business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes it has! I'm giving my body to be burned! But--ah you
don't understand!--it wants Sue to understand such things! And I
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) seducer--poor little girl! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)'s gone--and I don't care
about myself! Do what you like with me! ... And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did it for
conscience' sake, poor little Sue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)!--I mean, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>hiccuped Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``I've
my feelings too, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>); and I feel I belong to you in Heaven's
eye, and to nobody else, till death us do part! It is--hic--never
too late--hic to mend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>They had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) father's house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) softly unfastened the
door, groping about for a light within.

<p/>The circumstances were not altogether unlike those of their entry
into the cottage at Cresscombe, such a long time before. Nor were
perhaps Arabella's motives. But Jude did not think of that, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't find the matches, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had fastened up
the door. <div class="bookquote">``But never mind--this way. As quiet as you can, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as dark as pitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me your hand, and I'll lead you. That's it. Just sit down
here, and I'll pull off your boots. I don't want to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'d make a row, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) boots. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``take hold of
me--never mind your weight. Now--first stair, second stair--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But--are we out in our old house by Marygreen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>asked the stupefied
Jude. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't been inside it for years till now! Hey? And where
are my books? That's what I want to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are at my house, dear, where there's nobody to spy out how ill
you are. Now--third stair, fourth stair--that's it. Now we shall
get on.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>VII


<p/>Arabella was preparing breakfast in the downstairs back room of this
small, recently hired tenement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) father's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head
into the little pork-shop in front, and told Mr. Donn it was ready.
Donn, endeavouring to look like a master pork-butcher, in a greasy
blue blouse, and with a strap round his (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) waist from which a steel
dangled, came in promptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must mind the shop this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) said casually. <div class="bookquote">``I've to
go and get some inwards and half a pig from Lumsdon, and to call
elsewhere. If you live here you must put your shoulder to the wheel,
at least till I get the business started!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, for to-day I can't say.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked deedily into his (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``I've got a prize upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh? What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A husband--almost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It's Jude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)'s come back to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your old original one? Well, I'm damned!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I always did like him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), that I will say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how does he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) come to be up there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Donn, humour-struck, and
nodding to the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask inconvenient questions, Father. What we've to do is to
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) here till he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) and I are--as we were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah... Well it is the rummest thing I ever heard of--marrying an
old husband again, and so much new blood in the world! He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s no
catch, to my thinking. I'd have had a new one while I was about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't rum for a woman to want her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old husband back for
respectability, though for a man to want his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old wife back--well,
perhaps it is funny, rather!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>And Arabella was suddenly seized with
a fit of loud laughter, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) father joined more moderately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I'll do the rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had
recovered seriousness. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me this morning that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head ached
fit to burst, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hardly seemed to know where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was. And no
wonder, considering how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mixed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drink last night. We must keep
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jolly and cheerful here for a day or two, and not let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go back
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodging. Whatever you advance I'll pay back to you again.
But I must go up and see how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is now, poor deary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella ascended the stairs, softly opened the door of the first
bedroom, and peeped in. Finding that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) shorn Samson was asleep
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) entered to the bedside and stood regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>). The fevered
flush on his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) face from the debauch of the previous evening lessened
the fragility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) ordinary appearance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) long lashes,
dark brows, and curly back hair and beard against the white pillow
completed the physiognomy of one whom Arabella, as a woman of rank
passions, still felt it worth while to recapture, highly important
to recapture as a woman straitened both in means and in reputation.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ardent gaze seemed to affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) quick breathing became
suspended, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you now, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is I--Arabella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--where--oh yes, I remember! You gave me shelter... I am
stranded--ill--demoralized--damn bad! That's what I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then do stay here. There's nobody in the house but father and me,
and you can rest till you are thoroughly well. I'll tell them at
the stoneworks that you are knocked up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what they are thinking at the lodgings!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go round and explain. Perhaps you had better let me pay up, or
they'll think we've run away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. You'll find enough money in my pocket there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Quite indifferent, and shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) eyes because he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) could not bear
the daylight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) throbbing eye-balls, Jude seemed to doze again.
Arabella took his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) purse, softly left the room, and putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
outdoor things went off to the lodgings she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had quitted the
evening before.

<p/>Scarcely half an hour had elapsed ere she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reappeared round the
corner, walking beside a lad wheeling a truck on which were piled all
Jude's household possessions, and also the few of Arabella's things
which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had taken to the lodging for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) short sojourn there.
Jude was in such physical pain from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) unfortunate break-down of
the previous night, and in such mental pain from the loss of Sue and
from having yielded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) half-somnolent state to Arabella, that
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) few chattels unpacked and standing before his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) eyes in
this strange bedroom, intermixed with woman's apparel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) scarcely
considered how they had come there, or what their coming signalized.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father downstairs, <div class="bookquote">``we must keep plenty
of good liquor going in the house these next few days. I know his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
nature, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) once gets into that fearfully low state that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
does get into sometimes, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll never do the honourable thing by me
in this world, and I shall be left in the lurch. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) must be kept
cheerful. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has a little money in the savings bank, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has
given me his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) purse to pay for anything necessary. Well, that will
be the licence; for I must have that ready at hand, to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s in the humour. You must pay for the liquor. A few
friends, and a quiet convivial party would be the thing, if we could
get it up. It would advertise the shop, and help me too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That can be got up easy enough by anybody who'll afford victuals and
drink... Well yes--it would advertise the shop--that's true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Three days later, when Jude had recovered somewhat from the fearful
throbbing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes and brain, but was still considerably confused
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mind by what had been supplied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) by Arabella during
the interval--to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), jolly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) expressed it--the quiet
convivial gathering, suggested by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to wind Jude up to the
striking point, took place.

<p/>Donn had only just opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) miserable little pork and sausage
shop, which had as yet scarce any customers; nevertheless that party
advertised it well, and the Donns acquired a real notoriety among a
certain class in Christminster who knew not the colleges, nor their
works, nor their ways. Jude was asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could suggest any guest
in addition to those named by Arabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father, and in a
saturnine humour of perfect recklessness mentioned Uncle Joe, and
Stagg, and the decayed auctioneer, and others whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Stagg</b></font>) remembered as
having been frequenters of the well-known tavern during his (<font color='blue'><b>Stagg</b></font>) bout
therein years before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stagg</b></font>) also suggested Freckles and Bower o' Bliss.
Arabella took him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) word so far as the men went, but drew the
line at the ladies.

<p/>Another man they knew, Tinker Taylor, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) lived in the same
street, was not invited; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) went homeward from a late job on
the evening of the party, he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had occasion to call at the shop for
trotters. There were none in, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was promised some the next
morning. While making his (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) inquiry Taylor glanced into the back room,
and saw the guests sitting round, card-playing, and drinking, and
otherwise enjoying themselves at Donn's expense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) went home to
bed, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) way out next morning wondered how the party went
off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) thought it hardly worth while to call at the shop for his (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)
provisions at that hour, Donn and his (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) daughter being probably not up,
if they caroused late the night before. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) found in passing
that the door was open, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) could hear voices within, though the
shutters of the meat-stall were not down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) went and tapped at the
sitting-room door, and opened it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) said, astonished.

<p/>Hosts and guests were sitting card-playing, smoking, and talking,
precisely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) had left them eleven hours earlier; the gas was
burning and the curtains drawn, though it had been broad daylight
for two hours out of doors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>cried Arabella, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Here we are, just the same. We
ought to be ashamed of ourselves, oughtn't we? But it is a sort of
housewarming, you see; and our friends are in no hurry. Come in, Mr.
Taylor, and sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ironmonger</b></font>)</div><p/>The tinker, or rather reduced ironmonger, was nothing loath, and
entered and took a seat. <div class="bookquote">``I shall lose a quarter, but never mind,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, really, I could hardly believe my eyes when I looked
in! It seemed as if I was flung back again into last night, all of a
sudden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are. Pour out for Mr. Taylor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) now perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) was sitting beside Jude, her (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) arm being
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) waist. Jude, like the rest of the company, bore on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
face the signs of how deeply he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had been indulging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we've been waiting for certain legal hours to arrive, to
tell the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) continued bashfully, and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) spirituous
crimson look as much like a maiden blush as possible. <div class="bookquote">``Jude and I
have decided to make up matters between us by tying the knot again,
as we find we can't do without one another after all. So, as a
bright notion, we agreed to sit on till it was late enough, and go
and do it off-hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude seemed to pay no great heed to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) was announcing, or
indeed to anything whatever. The entrance of Taylor infused fresh
spirit into the company, and they remained sitting, till Arabella
whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) father: <div class="bookquote">``Now we may as well go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the parson don't know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) last night that we might come between eight and
nine, as there were reasons of decency for doing it as early and
quiet as possible; on account of it being our second marriage, which
might make people curious to look on if they knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) highly
approved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh very well, I'm ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) father, getting up and shaking
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, old darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) said to Jude. <div class="bookquote">``Come along, as you promised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When did I promise anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) had made so tipsy
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) special knowledge of that line of business as almost to have
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) sober again--or to seem so to those who did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella, affecting dismay. <div class="bookquote">``You've promised to marry me
several times as we've sat here to-night. These gentlemen have heard
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude doggedly. <div class="bookquote">``There's only one
woman--but I won't mention her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in this Capharnaum!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella looked towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Fawley be honourable,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Donn. <div class="bookquote">``You and my daughter have been living here together these
three or four days, quite on the understanding that you were going to
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Of course I shouldn't have had such goings on in my house
if I hadn't understood that. As a point of honour you must do it
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say anything against my honour!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>enjoined Jude hotly,
standing up. <div class="bookquote">``I'd marry the W-- of Babylon rather than do
anything dishonourable! No reflection on you, my dear. It is a
mere rhetorical figure--what they call in the books, hyperbole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep your figures for your debts to friends who shelter you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said
Donn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I am bound in honour to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--as I suppose I am--though
how I came to be here with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) I know no more than a dead man--marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) I will, so help me God! I have never behaved dishonourably to
a woman or to any living thing. I am not a man who wants to save
himself at the expense of the weaker among us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There--never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), deary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>), putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) cheek against
Jude's. <div class="bookquote">``Come up and wash your face, and just put yourself tidy, and
off we'll go. Make it up with Father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook hands. Jude went upstairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>), and soon came down
looking tidy and calm. Arabella, too, had hastily arranged herself,
and accompanied by Donn away they went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Donn</b></font>) said to the guests at parting. <div class="bookquote">``I've told the little
maid to get the breakfast while we are gone; and when we come back
we'll all have some. A good strong cup of tea will set everybody
right for going home.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>When Arabella, Jude, and Donn had disappeared on their matrimonial
errand the assembled guests yawned themselves wider awake, and
discussed the situation with great interest. Tinker Taylor, being
the most sober, reasoned the most lucidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to speak against friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But it do seem a
rare curiosity for a couple to marry over again! If they couldn't
get on the first time when their minds were limp, they won't the
second, by my reckoning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'ll do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s been put upon his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) honour by the woman, so he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) med.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'d hardly do it straight off like this. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s got no licence nor
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s got that, bless you. Didn't you hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say so to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tinker Taylor/Taylor</b></font>)</div>said Tinker Taylor, relighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) pipe at the gas-jet.
<div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) all together, limb by limb, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not such a bad-looking
piece--particular by candlelight. To be sure, halfpence that have
been in circulation can't be expected to look like new ones from
the mint. But for a woman that's been knocking about the four
hemispheres for some time, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s passable enough. A little bit thick
in the flitch perhaps: but I like a woman that a puff o' wind won't
blow down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes followed the movements of the little girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spread
the breakfast-cloth on the table they had been using, without wiping
up the slops of the liquor. The curtains were undrawn, and the
expression of the house made to look like morning. Some of the
guests, however, fell asleep in their chairs. One or two went to the
door, and gazed along the street more than once. Tinker Taylor was
the chief of these, and after a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) came in with a leer on his (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Gad, they are coming! I think the deed's done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Joe, following him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) in. <div class="bookquote">``Take my word, he (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) turned
rusty at the last minute. They are walking in a very unusual way;
and that's the meaning of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They waited in silence till the wedding-party could be heard entering
the house. First into the room came Arabella boisterously; and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
face was enough to show that her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) strategy had succeeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Fawley, I presume?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tinker Taylor/Taylor</b></font>)</div>said Tinker Taylor with mock courtesy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. Mrs. Fawley again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>replied Arabella blandly, pulling
off her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) glove and holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) left hand. ``There's the padlock,
see... Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) was a very nice, gentlemanly man indeed. I mean
the clergyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) said to me as gentle as a babe when all was done:
``Mrs. Fawley, I congratulate you heartily,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) says. ``For having
heard your history, and that of your husband, I think you have both
done the right and proper thing. And for your past errors as a wife,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as a husband, I think you ought now to be forgiven by the
world, as you have forgiven each other,'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>). Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) was a very
nice, gentlemanly man. ``The Church don't recognize divorce in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
dogma, strictly speaking,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) says: `and bear in mind the words of
the service in your goings out and your comings in: What God hath
joined together let no man put asunder.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a very nice,
gentlemanly man... But, Jude, my dear, you were enough to make a cat
laugh! You walked that straight, and held yourself that steady, that
one would have thought you were going `prentice to a judge; though I
knew you were seeing double all the time, from the way you fumbled
with my finger.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I'd do anything to--save a woman's honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>muttered Jude.
<div class="bookquote">``And I've done it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now, old deary, come along and have some breakfast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want--some--more whisky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude stolidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, dear. Not now! There's no more left. The tea will take
the muddle out of our heads, and we shall be as fresh as larks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right. I've--married you. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said I ought to marry you again,
and I have straightway. It is true religion! Ha--ha--ha!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>VIII


<p/>Michaelmas came and passed, and Jude and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) wife, who had lived but
a short time in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's house after their remarriage, were in
lodgings on the top floor of a dwelling nearer to the centre of the
city.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had done a few days' work during the two or three months since
the event, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) health had been indifferent, and it was now
precarious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was sitting in an arm-chair before the fire, and
coughed a good deal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over
again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>Arabella was saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I shall have to keep `ee
entirely--that's what `twill come to! I shall have to make black-pot
and sausages, and hawk 'em about the street, all to support an
invalid husband I'd no business to be saddled with at all. Why
didn't you keep your health, deceiving one like this? You were well
enough when the wedding was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), laughing acridly. <div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking of
my foolish feeling about the pig you and I killed during our
first marriage. I feel now that the greatest mercy that could be
vouchsafed to me would be that something should serve me as I served
that animal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the sort of discourse that went on between them every day
now. The landlord of the lodging, who had heard that they were a
queer couple, had doubted if they were married at all, especially
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had seen Arabella kiss Jude one evening when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had taken a
little cordial; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was about to give them notice to quit, till by
chance overhearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms,
and ultimately flinging a shoe at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) recognized the note of
genuine wedlock; and concluding that they must be respectable, said
no more.

<p/>Jude did not get any better, and one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) requested Arabella, with
considerable hesitation, to execute a commission for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) indifferently what it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To write to Sue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What in the name--do you want me to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To ask how she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll come to see me, because I'm ill,
and should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--once again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is like you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just in order not to insult you that I ask you to do it. You
know I love Sue. I don't wish to mince the matter--there stands the
fact: I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). I could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) without your knowledge. But I wish to be quite above-board with
you, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) husband. A message through you asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to come
is at least free from any odour of intrigue. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) retains any of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) old nature at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)'ll come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've no respect for marriage whatever, or its rights and duties!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What DOES it matter what my opinions are--a wretch like me! Can
it matter to anybody in the world who comes to see me for half an
hour--here with one foot in the grave! ... Come, please write,
Arabella!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``Repay my candour by a little generosity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think NOT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not just once?--Oh do!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) physical weakness had
taken away all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want HER to know how you are for? She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) don't want to see
`ee. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s the rat that forsook the sinking ship!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I stuck to un--the more fool I! Have that strumpet in the house
indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Almost as soon as the words were spoken Jude sprang from the chair,
and before Arabella knew where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) back upon a
little couch which stood there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) kneeling above her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say another word of that sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll kill
you--here and now! I've everything to gain by it--my own death not
being the least part. So don't think there's no meaning in what I
say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want me to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>gasped Arabella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Promise never to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take your word,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said scornfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) loosened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But what
it is worth I can't say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't kill the pig, but you could kill me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--there you have me! No--I couldn't kill you--even in a passion.
Taunt away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) then began coughing very much, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) estimated his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) life with an
appraiser's eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) sank back ghastly pale. <div class="bookquote">``I'll send for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>Arabella murmured, <div class="bookquote">``if you'll agree to my being in the room with you
all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>The softer side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) nature, the desire to see Sue, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) unable
to resist the offer even now, provoked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had been; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) replied
breathlessly: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I agree. Only send for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) inquired if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had written.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I wrote a note telling her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) you were ill, and asking
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to come to-morrow or the day after. I haven't posted it yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day Jude wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) really did post it, but would not
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>); and foolish Hope, that lives on a drop and a crumb, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
restless with expectation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knew the times of the possible trains,
and listened on each occasion for sounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) did not come; but Jude would not address Arabella again thereon.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) hoped and expected all the next day; but no Sue appeared; neither
was there any note of reply. Then Jude decided in the privacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
mind that Arabella had never posted hers, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had written
it. There was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) manner which told it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) physical
weakness was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) shed tears at the disappointment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
was not there to see. His (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) suspicions were, in fact, well founded.
Arabella, like some other nurses, thought that your duty towards your
invalid was to pacify him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) by any means short of really acting upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) fancies.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) never said another word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) wish or his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) conjecture.
A silent, undiscerned resolve grew up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), if not
strength, stability and calm. One midday when, after an absence of
two hours, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) came into the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) beheld the chair empty.

<p/>Down she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) flopped on the bed, and sitting, meditated. <div class="bookquote">``Now where the
devil is my man gone to!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said.

<p/>A driving rain from the north-east had been falling with more or less
intermission all the morning, and looking from the window at the
dripping spouts it seemed impossible to believe that any sick man
would have ventured out to almost certain death. Yet a conviction
possessed Arabella that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) had gone out, and it became a certainty
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had searched the house. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s such a fool, let him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can do no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude was at that moment in a railway train that was drawing near to
Alfredston, oddly swathed, pale as a monumental figure in alabaster,
and much stared at by other passengers. An hour later his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) thin form,
in the long great-coat and blanket he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had come with, but without an
umbrella, could have been seen walking along the five-mile road to
Marygreen. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face showed the determined purpose that alone
sustained him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), but to which has weakness afforded a sorry foundation.
By the up-hill walk he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was quite blown, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) pressed on; and at
half-past three o'clock stood by the familiar well at Marygreen.
The rain was keeping everybody indoors; Jude crossed the green to the
church without observation, and found the building open. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
stood, looking forth at the school, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could hear the usual
sing-song tones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation's
groan.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) waited till a small boy came from the school--one evidently
allowed out before hours for some reason or other. Jude held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
hand, and the child came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please call at the schoolhouse and ask Mrs. Phillotson if she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) will
be kind enough to come to the church for a few minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child departed, and Jude heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) knock at the door of the
dwelling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) himself went further into the church. Everything
was new, except a few pieces of carving preserved from the wrecked
old fabric, now fixed against the new walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) stood by these:
they seemed akin to the perished people of that place who were his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
ancestors and Sue's.

<p/>A light footstep, which might have been accounted no more than an
added drip to the rainfall, sounded in the porch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) looked
round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I didn't think it was you! I didn't--Oh, Jude!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A hysterical
catch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) breath ended in a succession of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) advanced, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) quickly recovered and went back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go--don't go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) implored. <div class="bookquote">``This is my last time! I thought
it would be less intrusive than to enter your house. And I shall
never come again. Don't then be unmerciful. Sue, Sue! We are
acting by the letter; and `the letter killeth'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll stay--I won't be unkind!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) mouth quivering and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
tears flowing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to come closer. <div class="bookquote">``But why did you
come, and do this wrong thing, after doing such a right thing as you
have done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What right thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marrying Arabella again. It was in the Alfredston paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has

you again.''

suffered the loss of your faculties! I would argue with you if I

so many women do about these things; and don't actually believe what
you pretend to, and only are indulging in the luxury of the emotion
raised by an affected belief?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Luxury! How can you be so cruel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You dear, sad, soft, most melancholy wreck of a promising human

off quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will. I would never come to see you again, even if I had the

not worth a man's love!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bosom began to go up and down. <div class="bookquote">``I can't endure you to say that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) burst out, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) eye resting on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) turned back
impulsively. <div class="bookquote">``Don't, don't scorn me! Kiss me, oh kiss me lots
of times, and say I am not a coward and a contemptible humbug--I
can't bear it!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) rushed up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) and, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) mouth on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>),
continued: <div class="bookquote">``I must tell you--oh I must--my darling Love! It has

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean it is a nominal marriage only. It hasn't been more than that

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said. Pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) bruised her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
lips with kisses. <div class="bookquote">``If misery can know happiness, I have a moment's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do you! There's one more, in memory of our dead little

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The words struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) like a blow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) head. ``I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--let me make my last appeal. Listen to this! We've both

our mistakes, and run away together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; again no! ... Why do you tempt me so far, Jude! It is too

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) ran up the church to the east end, and Jude did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) requested.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) head, but took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) blanket, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had not
seen, and went straight out. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) passed the end of the church she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) coughs mingling with the rain on the windows, and in a last
instinct of human affection, even now unsubdued by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) fetters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>)
sprang up as if to go and succour him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) knelt down again, and
stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) ears with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) hands till all possible sound of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had
passed away.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was by this time at the corner of the green, from which the path
ran across the fields in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had scared rooks as a boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
turned and looked back, once, at the building which still contained
Sue; and then went on, knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes would light on that
scene no more.

<p/>There are cold spots up and down Wessex in autumn and winter weather;
but the coldest of all when a north or east wind is blowing is the
crest of the down by the Brown House, where the road to Alfredston
crosses the old Ridgeway. Here the first winter sleets and snows
fall and lie, and here the spring frost lingers last unthawed. Here
in the teeth of the north-east wind and rain Jude now pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
way, wet through, the necessary slowness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) walk from lack of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
former strength being insufficent to maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) heat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) came to
the milestone, and, raining as it was, spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) blanket and lay
down there to rest. Before moving on he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went and felt at the back
of the stone for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) own carving. It was still there; but nearly
obliterated by moss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) passed the spot where the gibbet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
ancestor and Sue's had stood, and descended the hill.

<p/>It was dark when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) reached Alfredston, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had a cup of tea,
the deadly chill that began to creep into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) bones being too much
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) to endure fasting. To get home he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had to travel by a steam
tram-car, and two branches of railway, with much waiting at a
junction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) did not reach Christminster till ten o'clock.



<p/>IX


<p/>On the platform stood Arabella. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) up and down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div>said Jude, literally tottering with cold and lassitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now you'd best march along home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The water ran out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) went, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was compelled to lean
against the wall to support himself while coughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've done for yourself by this, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know whether you know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do. I meant to do for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--to commit suicide?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm blest! Kill yourself for a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me, Arabella. You think you are the stronger; and so
you are, in a physical sense, now. You could push me over like a
nine-pin. You did not send that letter the other day, and I could
not resent your conduct. But I am not so weak in another way as
you think. I made up my mind that a man confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room by
inflammation of the lungs, a fellow who had only two wishes left in
the world, to see a particular woman, and then to die, could neatly
accomplish those two wishes at one stroke by taking this journey in
the rain. That I've done. I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for the last time, and
I've finished myself--put an end to a feverish life which ought never
to have been begun!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord--you do talk lofty! Won't you have something warm to drink?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No thank you. Let's get home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>They went along by the silent colleges, and Jude kept stopping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you looking at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stupid fancies. I see, in a way, those spirits of the dead again,
on this my last walk, that I saw when I first walked here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a curious chap you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I seem to see them, and almost hear them rustling. But I don't
revere all of them as I did then. I don't believe in half of them.
The theologians, the apologists, and their kin the metaphysicians,
the high-handed statesmen, and others, no longer interest me. All
that has been spoilt for me by the grind of stern reality!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>The expression of Jude's corpselike face in the watery lamplight was
indeed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) saw people where there was nobody. At moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
stood still by an archway, like one watching a figure walk out; then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would look at a window like one discerning a familiar face behind
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed to hear voices, whose words he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) repeated as if to
gather their meaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They seem laughing at me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I was talking to myself! The phantoms all about here, in the
college archways, and windows. They used to look friendly in the old
days, particularly Addison, and Gibbon, and Johnson, and Dr. Browne,
and Bishop Ken--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along do! Phantoms! There's neither living nor dead
hereabouts except a damn policeman! I never saw the streets
emptier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy! The Poet of Liberty used to walk here, and the great
Dissector of Melancholy there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to hear about 'em! They bore me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter Raleigh is beckoning to me from that lane--Wycliffe--Harvey--
Hooker--Arnold--and a whole crowd of Tractarian Shades--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``I DON<div class="bookquote">``T WANT to know their names, I tell you! What do I care about

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must rest a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) paused, holding to the
railings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) measured with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eye the height of a college front.
<div class="bookquote">``This is old Rubric. And that Sarcophagus; and up that lane Crozier
and Tudor: and all down there is Cardinal with its long front, and
its windows with lifted eyebrows, representing the polite surprise of
the university at the efforts of such as I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, and I'll treat you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. It will help me home, for I feel the chilly fog from
the meadows of Cardinal as if death-claws were grabbing me through
and through. As Antigone said, I am neither a dweller among men nor
ghosts. But, Arabella, when I am dead, you'll see my spirit flitting
up and down here among these!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! You mayn't die after all. You are tough enough yet, old
man.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was night at Marygreen, and the rain of the afternoon showed no
sign of abatement. About the time at which Jude and Arabella were
walking the streets of Christminster homeward, the Widow Edlin
crossed the green, and opened the back door of the schoolmaster's
dwelling, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) often did now before bedtime, to assist Sue in
putting things away.

<p/>Sue was muddling helplessly in the kitchen, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) was not a good
housewife, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) tried to be, and grew impatient of domestic
details.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord love `ee, what do ye do that yourself for, when I've come o'
purpose! You knew I should come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--I don't know--I forgot! No, I didn't forget. I did it to

neglected them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Why should ye? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll get a better school, perhaps be a parson, in

hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk of my pretty hands, Mrs. Edlin. This pretty body of mine

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshoo--you've got no body to speak of! You put me more in mind

Husband cross?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Husband</b></font>) never is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Husband</b></font>)'s gone to bed early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you. I have done wrong to-day. And I want to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow. <div class="bookquote">``I told `ee how `twould be!''

Richard--by doing a penance--the ultimate thing. I must!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't--since he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) agrees to it being otherwise, and it has gone

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it you don't like in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edlin/Edlin</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Edlin curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you. It is something... I cannot say. The mournful

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever tell Jude what it was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard strange tales o' husbands in my time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>observed the widow
in a lowered voice. <div class="bookquote">``They say that when the saints were upon the

is to-night! Well--don't be in a hurry to alter things, my dear.
Think it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! I've screwed my weak soul up to treating him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) more

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my duty. I will drink my cup to the dregs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edlin/Edlin</b></font>)</div><p/>Half an hour later when Mrs. Edlin put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) bonnet and shawl to
leave, Sue seemed to be seized with vague terror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--no--don't go, Mrs. Edlin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) implored, her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) eyes enlarged, and
with a quick nervous look over her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is bedtime, child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but--there's the little spare room--my room that was. It is
quite ready. Please stay, Mrs. Edlin!--I shall want you in the
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well--I don't mind, if you wish. Nothing will happen to my four
old walls, whether I be there or no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) then fastened up the doors, and they ascended the stairs
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait here, Mrs. Edlin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sue</b></font>)</div>said Sue. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go into my old room a
moment by myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaving the widow on the landing Sue turned to the chamber which had
been hers exclusively since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) arrival at Marygreen, and pushing to
the door knelt down by the bed for a minute or two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) then arose,
and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) night-gown from the pillow undressed and came out to
Mrs. Edlin. A man could be heard snoring in the room opposite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>)
wished Mrs. Edlin good-night, and the widow entered the room that Sue
had just vacated.

<p/>Sue unlatched the other chamber door, and, as if seized with
faintness, sank down outside it. Getting up again she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) half opened
the door, and said <div class="bookquote">``Richard.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As the word came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) mouth she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>)
visibly shuddered.

<p/>The snoring had quite ceased for some time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not reply.
Sue seemed relieved, and hurried back to Mrs. Edlin's chamber. <div class="bookquote">``Are
you in bed, Mrs. Edlin?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow, opening the door. <div class="bookquote">``I be old and slow,
and it takes me a long while to un-ray. I han't unlaced my jumps
yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--don't hear him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)! And perhaps--perhaps--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``And then--I should be FREE, and I
could go to Jude! ... Ah--no--I forgot HER--and God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go and hearken. No--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s snoring again. But the rain and the
wind is so loud that you can hardly hear anything but between
whiles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Sue had dragged herself back. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Edlin, good-night again! I am
sorry I called you out.''  (<font color='red'><b>The widow</b></font>)</div>The widow retreated a second time.

<p/>The strained, resigned look returned to Sue's face when she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was
alone. <div class="bookquote">``I must do it--I must! I must drink to the dregs!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Richard!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey--what? Is that you, Susanna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want? Anything the matter? Wait a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulled
on some articles of clothing, and came to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When we were at Shaston I jumped out of the window rather than that
you should come near me. I have never reversed that treatment till
now--when I have come to beg your pardon for it, and ask you to let
me in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you only think you ought to do this? I don't wish you to
come against your impulses, as I have said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I beg to be admitted.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) waited a moment, and repeated,
<div class="bookquote">``I beg to be admitted! I have been in error--even to-day. I have
exceeded my rights. I did not mean to tell you, but perhaps I ought.
I sinned against you this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met Jude! I didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was coming. And--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>), and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) kiss me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--the old story!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Richard, I didn't know we were going to kiss each other till we
did!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many times?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good many. I don't know. I am horrified to look back on it, and
the least I can do after it is to come to you like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come--this is pretty bad, after what I've done! Anything else to
confess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had been intending to say: <div class="bookquote">``I called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) my darling Love.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But, as a contrite woman always keeps back a little, that portion of
the scene remained untold. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``I am never going to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
any more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) spoke of some things of the past, and it overcame me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) spoke of--the children. But, as I have said, I am glad--almost
glad I mean--that they are dead, Richard. It blots out all that life
of mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--about not seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) again any more. Come--you really mean
this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Phillotson/Mr. Phillotson</b></font>)</div>There was something in Phillotson's tone now which seemed to
show that his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) three months of remarriage with Sue had somehow not
been so satisfactory as his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) magnanimity or amative patience had
anticipated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you'll swear it on the New Testament?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) went back to the room and brought out a little brown Testament.
<div class="bookquote">``Now then: So help you God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) swore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I supplicate you, Richard, to whom I belong, and whom I wish to
honour and obey, as I vowed, to let me in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think it over well. You know what it means. Having you back in the
house was one thing--this another. So think again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought--I wish this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a complaisant spirit--and perhaps you are right. With a
lover hanging about, a half-marriage should be completed. But I
repeat my reminder this third and last time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my wish! ... O God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What did you say <div class="bookquote">``O God' for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes you do! But ...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) gloomily considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) thin and fragile
form a moment longer as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) crouched before him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) night-clothes.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I thought it might end like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) said presently. <div class="bookquote">``I owe
you nothing, after these signs; but I'll take you in at your word,
and forgive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) up. Sue started back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) asked, speaking for the first time sternly.
<div class="bookquote">``You shrink from me again?--just as formerly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Richard--I--I--was not thinking--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wish to come in here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You still bear in mind what it means?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It is my duty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Placing the candlestick on the chest of drawers he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillotson</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) through
the doorway, and lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) bodily, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>). A quick look of
aversion passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) face, but clenching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) teeth she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) uttered
no cry.

<p/>Mrs. Edlin had by this time undressed, and was about to get into bed
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) said to herself: <div class="bookquote">``Ah--perhaps I'd better go and see if the
little thing is all right. How it do blow and rain!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The widow went out on the landing, and saw that Sue had disappeared. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
Poor soul! Weddings be funerals 'a b`lieve nowadays. Fifty-five
years ago, come Fall, since my man and I married! Times have changed
since then!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>X


<p/>Despite himself Jude recovered somewhat, and worked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) trade for
several weeks. After Christmas, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) broke down again.

<p/>With the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had earned he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lodgings to a yet more
central part of the town. But Arabella saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) was not likely
to do much work for a long while, and was cross enough at the turn
affairs had taken since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) remarriage to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm hanged if you
haven't been clever in this last stroke!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``to get a
nurse for nothing by marrying me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Jude was absolutely indifferent to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said, and indeed, often
regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) abuse in a humorous light. Sometimes his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mood was more
earnest, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lay he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) often rambled on upon the defeat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
early aims.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every man has some little power in some one direction,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would
say. <div class="bookquote">``I was never really stout enough for the stone trade,
particularly the fixing. Moving the blocks always used to strain
me, and standing the trying draughts in buildings before the windows
are in always gave me colds, and I think that began the mischief
inside. But I felt I could do one thing if I had the opportunity.
I could accumulate ideas, and impart them to others. I wonder if the
founders had such as I in their minds--a fellow good for nothing else
but that particular thing? ... I hear that soon there is going to
be a better chance for such helpless students as I was. There are
schemes afoot for making the university less exclusive, and extending
its influence. I don't know much about it. And it is too late, too
late for me! Ah--and for how many worthier ones before me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How you keep a-mumbling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``I should have thought
you'd have got over all that craze about books by this time. And so
you would, if you'd had any sense to begin with. You are as bad now
as when we were first married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On one occasion while soliloquizing thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Sue''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>unconsciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd mind who you are talking to!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella
indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``Calling a respectable married woman by the name of
that--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) remembered herself and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) did not catch the word.

<p/>But in the course of time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) saw how things were going, and
how very little she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had to fear from Sue's rivalry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) had a fit of
generosity. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you want to see your--Sue?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
I don't mind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coming. You can have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) here if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--that's a change!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anything about me--that I'm ill, or anything.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) course. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) received a surprise. Mrs. Edlin came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), quite
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) own account. Jude's wife, whose feelings as to where his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
affections were centred had reached absolute indifference by
this time, went out, leaving the old woman alone with Jude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
impulsively asked how Sue was, and then said bluntly, remembering
what Sue had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I suppose they are still only husband and
wife in name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Edlin hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Well, no--it's different now. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s begun it
quite lately--all of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own free will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When did she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) begin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) asked quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The night after you came. But as a punishment to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) poor self.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) didn't wish it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) insisted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sue, my Sue--you darling fool--this is almost more than I can
endure! ... Mrs. Edlin--don't be frightened at my rambling--I've
got to talk to myself lying here so many hours alone--she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) was once
a woman whose intellect was to mine like a star to a benzoline lamp:
who saw all MY superstitions as cobwebs that she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) could brush away
with a word. Then bitter affliction came to us, and her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) intellect
broke, and she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) veered round to darkness. Strange difference of sex,
that time and circumstance, which enlarge the views of most men,
narrow the views of women almost invariably. And now the ultimate
horror has come--her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) giving herself like this to what she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) loathes, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) enslavement to forms! She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), so sensitive, so shrinking, that the
very wind seemed to blow on her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) with a touch of deference... As for
Sue and me when we were at our own best, long ago--when our minds
were clear, and our love of truth fearless--the time was not ripe
for us! Our ideas were fifty years too soon to be any good to us.
And so the resistance they met with brought reaction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sue</b></font>), and
recklessness and ruin on me! ... There--this, Mrs. Edlin, is how
I go on to myself continually, as I lie here. I must be boring you
awfully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, my dear boy. I could hearken to `ee all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>As Jude reflected more and more on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) news, and grew more restless,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) began in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) mental agony to use terribly profane language about
social conventions, which started a fit of coughing. Presently there
came a knock at the door downstairs. As nobody answered it Mrs.
Edlin herself went down.

<p/>The visitor said blandly: <div class="bookquote">``The Doctor.''  (<font color='red'><b>The visitor</b></font>)</div>The lanky form was that of
Physician Vilbert, who had been called in by Arabella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is my patient at present?''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>asked the physician.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh bad--very bad! Poor chap, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) got excited, and do blaspeam
terribly, since I let out some gossip by accident--the more to my
blame. But there--you must excuse a man in suffering for what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
says, and I hope God will forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah. I'll go up and see him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Mrs. Fawley at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)'s not in at present, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fawley</b></font>)'ll be here soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Vilbert</b></font>)</div><p/>Vilbert went; but though Jude had hitherto taken the medicines of
that skilful practitioner with the greatest indifference whenever
poured down his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) throat by Arabella, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was now so brought to bay by
events that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) vented his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) opinion of Vilbert in the physician's face,
and so forcibly, and with such striking epithets, that Vilbert soon
scurried downstairs again. At the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) met Arabella, Mrs. Edlin
having left. Arabella inquired how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) husband was
now, and seeing that the Doctor looked ruffled, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to take
something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) assented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll bring it to you here in the passage,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There's
nobody but me about the house to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) a bottle and a glass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) drank.

<p/>Arabella began shaking with suppressed laughter. <div class="bookquote">``What is this, my
dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) asked, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--a drop of wine--and something in it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Laughing again she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) said:
<div class="bookquote">``I poured your own love-philtre into it, that you sold me at the
agricultural show, don't you re-member?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, I do! Clever woman! But you must be prepared for the
consequences.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) shoulders he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>)
there and then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) whispered, laughing good-humouredly. <div class="bookquote">``My man will
hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) out of the house, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) went back she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) said to
herself: <div class="bookquote">``Well! Weak women must provide for a rainy day. And if my
poor fellow upstairs do go off--as I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will soon--it's well
to keep chances open. And I can't pick and choose now as I could
when I was younger. And one must take the old if one can't get the
young.''

<p/>The last pages to which the chronicler of these lives would ask the
reader's attention are concerned with the scene in and out of Jude's
bedroom when leafy summer came round again.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face was now so thin that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) old friends would hardly have known
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>). It was afternoon, and Arabella was at the looking-glass curling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) hair, which operation she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) performed by heating an umbrella-stay
in the flame of a candle she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) had lighted, and using it upon the
flowing lock. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) had finished this, practised a dimple, and
put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) eyes round upon Jude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) seemed to
be sleeping, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) position was an elevated one, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) malady
preventing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) lying down.

<p/>Arabella, hatted, gloved, and ready, sat down and waited, as if
expecting some one to come and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) place as nurse.

<p/>Certain sounds from without revealed that the town was in festivity,
though little of the festival, whatever it might have been, could be
seen here. Bells began to ring, and the notes came into the room
through the open window, and travelled round Jude's head in a hum.
They made her (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) restless, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) said to herself: <div class="bookquote">``Why ever
doesn't Father come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) looked again at Jude, critically gauged his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ebbing life, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>)
had done so many times during the late months, and glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
watch, which was hung up by way of timepiece, rose impatiently.
Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) slept, and coming to a resolution she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) slipped from the room,
closed the door noiselessly, and descended the stairs. The house
was empty. The attraction which moved Arabella to go abroad had
evidently drawn away the other inmates long before.

<p/>It was a warm, cloudless, enticing day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) shut the front door, and
hastened round into Chief Street, and when near the theatre could
hear the notes of the organ, a rehearsal for a coming concert being
in progress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) entered under the archway of Oldgate College, where
men were putting up awnings round the quadrangle for a ball in the
hall that evening. People who had come up from the country for the
day were picnicking on the grass, and Arabella walked along the
gravel paths and under the aged limes. But finding this place rather
dull she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) returned to the streets, and watched the carriages drawing
up for the concert, numerous Dons and their wives, and undergraduates
with gay female companions, crowding up likewise. When the doors
were closed, and the concert began, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) moved on.

<p/>The powerful notes of that concert rolled forth through the swinging
yellow blinds of the open windows, over the housetops, and into the
still air of the lanes. They reached so far as to the room in which
Jude lay; and it was about this time that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cough began again and
awakened him (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>).

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) could speak he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) eyes still closed: <div class="bookquote">``A
little water, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing but the deserted room received his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) appeal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) coughed
to exhaustion again--saying still more feebly: <div class="bookquote">``Water--some
water--Sue--Arabella!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The room remained still as before. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) gasped again:
<div class="bookquote">``Throat--water--Sue--darling--drop of water--please--oh please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No water came, and the organ notes, faint as a bee's hum, rolled in
as before.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) remained, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face changing, shouts and hurrahs came from
somewhere in the direction of the river.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--yes! The Remembrance games,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``And I here. And
Sue defiled!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The hurrahs were repeated, drowning the faint organ notes. Jude's
face changed more: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) whispered slowly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) parched lips scarcely
moving:

<p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it
was said, There is a man-child conceived.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>_

<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Hurrah!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither
let the light shine upon it. Lo, let that night be solitary, let no
joyful voice come therein.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>_

<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Hurrah!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when
I came out of the belly? ... For now should I have lain still and
been quiet. I should have slept: then had I been at rest!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>_

<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Hurrah!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/>_<div class="bookquote">``There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the
oppressor... The small and the great are there; and the servant is
free from his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master. Wherefore is light given to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) that is in
misery, and life unto the bitter in soul?'' (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>_



<p/>Meanwhile Arabella, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) journey to discover what was going on,
took a short cut down a narrow street and through an obscure nook
into the quad of Cardinal. It was full of bustle, and brilliant
in the sunlight with flowers and other preparations for a ball
here also. A carpenter nodded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>), one who had formerly been a
fellow-workman of Jude's. A corridor was in course of erection from
the entrance to the hall staircase, of gay red and buff bunting.
Waggon-loads of boxes containing bright plants in full bloom were
being placed about, and the great staircase was covered with red
cloth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) nodded to one workman and another, and ascended to the
hall on the strength of their acquaintance, where they were putting
down a new floor and decorating for the dance.

<p/>The cathedral bell close at hand was sounding for five o'clock
service.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not mind having a spin there with a fellow's arm round my
waist,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said to one of the men. <div class="bookquote">``But Lord, I must be getting
home again--there's a lot to do. No dancing for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) reached home she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) was met at the door by Stagg, and one or
two other of Jude's fellow stoneworkers. <div class="bookquote">``We are just going down
to the river,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the former, <div class="bookquote">``to see the boat-bumping. But we've
called round on our way to ask how your husband is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s sleeping nicely, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella.

<p/>``That's right. Well now, can't you give yourself half an hour's
relaxation, Mrs. Fawley, and come along with us? <div class="bookquote">``Twould do you
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I've never seen the boat-racing,
and I hear it is good fun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How I WISH I could!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) looked longingly down the street. <div class="bookquote">``Wait
a minute, then. I'll just run up and see how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is now. Father is
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), I believe; so I can most likely come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They waited, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) entered. Downstairs the inmates were absent
as before, having, in fact, gone in a body to the river where the
procession of boats was to pass. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) reached the bedroom she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
found that her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) father had not even now come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) have been here!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) wants to
see the boats himself--that's what it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>However, on looking round to the bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) brightened, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) saw
that Jude was apparently sleeping, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was not in the usual
half-elevated posture necessitated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) cough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) had slipped
down, and lay flat. A second glance caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) to start, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>)
went to the bed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) face was quite white, and gradually becoming
rigid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) fingers; they were cold, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) body was
still warm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) listened at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) chest. All was still within. The
bumping of near thirty years had ceased.

<p/>After her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) first appalled sense of what had happened, the faint notes
of a military or other brass band from the river reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) ears;
and in a provoked tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``To think he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) should die just
now! Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) die just now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then meditating another moment or
two she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) went to the door, softly closed it as before, and again
descended the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>the workmen</b></font>)</div>said one of the workmen. <div class="bookquote">``We wondered if you were
coming after all. Come along; we must be quick to get a good
place... Well, how is he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)? Sleeping well still? Of course, we don't
want to drag `ee away if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes--sleeping quite sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) won't wake yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said
hurriedly.

<p/>They went with the crowd down Cardinal Street, where they presently
reached the bridge, and the gay barges burst upon their view. Thence
they passed by a narrow slit down to the riverside path--now dusty,
hot, and thronged. Almost as soon as they had arrived the grand
procession of boats began; the oars smacking with a loud kiss on the
face of the stream, as they were lowered from the perpendicular.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say--how jolly! I'm glad I've come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``And--it
can't hurt my husband--my being away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On the opposite side of the river, on the crowded barges, were
gorgeous nosegays of feminine beauty, fashionably arrayed in green,
pink, blue, and white. The blue flag of the boat club denoted the
centre of interest, beneath which a band in red uniform gave out the
notes she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had already heard in the death-chamber. Collegians of all
sorts, in canoes with ladies, watching keenly for <div class="bookquote">``our''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>boat, darted
up and down. While she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) regarded the lively scene somebody touched
Arabella in the ribs, and looking round she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) saw Vilbert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That philtre is operating, you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arabella</b></font>) said with a leer. <div class="bookquote">``Shame
on `ee to wreck a heart so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't talk of love to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? It is a general holiday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did not reply. Vilbert's arm stole round her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) waist, which act
could be performed unobserved in the crowd. An arch expression
overspread Arabella's face at the feel of the arm, but she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
eyes on the river as if she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did not know of the embrace.

<p/>The crowd surged, pushing Arabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) friends sometimes nearly
into the river, and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would have laughed heartily at the horse-play
that succeeded, if the imprint on her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) mind's eye of a pale,
statuesque countenance she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had lately gazed upon had not sobered her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
a little.

<p/>The fun on the water reached the acme of excitement; there were
immersions, there were shouts: the race was lost and won, the pink
and blue and yellow ladies retired from the barges, and the people
who had watched began to move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--it's been awfully good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>cried Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``But I think I must
get back to my poor man. Father is there, so far as I know; but I
had better get back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's your hurry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must go... Dear, dear, this is awkward!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>At the narrow gangway where the people ascended from the riverside
path to the bridge the crowd was literally jammed into one hot
mass--Arabella and Vilbert with the rest; and here they remained
motionless, Arabella exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>more and more
impatiently; for it had just occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vilbert</b></font>) mind that if Jude were
discovered to have died alone an inquest might be deemed necessary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fidget you are, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>said the physician, who, being
pressed close against her (<font color='blue'><b>Vilbert</b></font>) by the throng, had no need of personal
effort for contact. <div class="bookquote">``Just as well have patience: there's no getting
away yet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the multitude</b></font>)</div><p/>It was nearly ten minutes before the wedged multitude moved
sufficiently to let them pass through. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Vilbert</b></font>) got up
into the street Arabella hastened on, forbidding the physician to
accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Vilbert</b></font>) further that day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vilbert</b></font>) did not go straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vilbert</b></font>)
house; but to the abode of a woman who performed the last necessary
offices for the poorer dead; where she (<font color='blue'><b>Vilbert</b></font>) knocked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband has just gone, poor soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vilbert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Can you come and
lay him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div><p/>Arabella waited a few minutes; and the two women went along, elbowing
their way through the stream of fashionable people pouring out of
Cardinal meadow, and being nearly knocked down by the carriages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must call at the sexton's about the bell, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella.
<div class="bookquote">``It is just round here, isn't it? I'll meet you at my door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude/Jude Fawley/Fawley</b></font>)</div><p/>By ten o'clock that night Jude was lying on the bedstead at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>)
lodging covered with a sheet, and straight as an arrow. Through the
partly opened window the joyous throb of a waltz entered from the
ball-room at Cardinal.



<p/>Two days later, when the sky was equally cloudless, and the air
equally still, two persons stood beside Jude's open coffin in the
same little bedroom. On one side was Arabella, on the other the
Widow Edlin. They were both looking at Jude's face, the worn old
eyelids of Mrs. Edlin being red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How beautiful he (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>)'s a `andsome corpse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella.

<p/>The window was still open to ventilate the room, and it being about
noontide the clear air was motionless and quiet without. From a
distance came voices; and an apparent noise of persons stamping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>murmured the old woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's the Doctors in the theatre, conferring Honorary degrees
on the Duke of Hamptonshire and a lot more illustrious gents of that
sort. It's Remembrance Week, you know. The cheers come from the
young men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye; young and strong-lunged! Not like our poor boy here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jude</b></font>)</div><p/>An occasional word, as from some one making a speech, floated from
the open windows of the theatre across to this quiet corner, at which
there seemed to be a smile of some sort upon the marble features
of Jude; while the old, superseded, Delphin editions of Virgil and
Horace, and the dog-eared Greek Testament on the neighbouring shelf,
and the few other volumes of the sort that he (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) had not parted with,
roughened with stone-dust where he (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) had been in the habit of catching
them up for a few minutes between his (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) labours, seemed to pale to a
sickly cast at the sounds. The bells struck out joyously; and their
reverberations travelled round the bed-room.

<p/>Arabella's eyes removed from Jude to Mrs. Edlin. <div class="bookquote">``D'ye think she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
will come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Edlin</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not say. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) swore not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) looking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Tired and miserable, poor heart. Years and years older than when
you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) last. Quite a staid, worn woman now. <div class="bookquote">``Tis the man--she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
can't stomach un, even now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Jude had been alive to see her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) would hardly have cared for
her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) any more, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what we don't know... Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) ever ask you to send for
her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), since he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) in that strange way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Quite the contrary. I offered to send, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) said I was not
to let her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) know how ill he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well--poor little thing, `tis to be believed she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s found forgiveness
somewhere! She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had found peace!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) may swear that on her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) knees to the holy cross upon her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) necklace
till she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s hoarse, but it won't be true!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arabella/Donn/Arabella Donn</b></font>)</div>said Arabella. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s
never found peace since she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) arms, and never will again till
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jude</b></font>) is now!''

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations. To donate, please visit:

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.net

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
