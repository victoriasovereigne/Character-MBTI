<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>A narrow grave-yard in the heart of a bustling, indifferent city, seen
from the windows of a gloomy-looking inn, is at no time an object of
enlivening suggestion; and the spectacle is not at its best when the
mouldy tombstones and funereal umbrage have received the ineffectual
refreshment of a dull, moist snow-fall. If, while the air is thickened
by this frosty drizzle, the calendar should happen to indicate that the
blessed vernal season is already six weeks old, it will be admitted that
no depressing influence is absent from the scene. This fact was keenly
felt on a certain 12th of May, upwards of thirty years since, by a lady
who stood looking out of one of the windows of the best hotel in the
ancient city of Boston. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had stood there for half an hour--stood
there, that is, at intervals; for from time to time she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned back
into the room and measured its length with a restless step. In the
chimney-place was a red-hot fire which emitted a small blue flame; and
in front of the fire, at a table, sat a young man who was busily plying
a pencil. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a number of sheets of paper cut into small
equal squares, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was apparently covering them with pictorial
designs--strange-looking figures. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked rapidly and attentively,
sometimes threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drawing at arm's-length,
and kept up a soft, gay-sounding humming and whistling. The lady brushed
past him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) walk; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) much-trimmed skirts were voluminous. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never
dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only turned them, occasionally, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed, to a mirror suspended above the toilet-table on the other
side of the room. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paused a moment, gave a pinch to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) waist
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) two hands, or raised these members--they were very plump
and pretty--to the multifold braids of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair, with a movement half
caressing, half corrective. An attentive observer might have fancied
that during these periods of desultory self-inspection her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face forgot
its melancholy; but as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neared the window again it began to
proclaim that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a very ill-pleased woman. And indeed, in what
met her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes there was little to be pleased with. The window-panes were
battered by the sleet; the head-stones in the grave-yard beneath seemed
to be holding themselves askance to keep it out of their faces. A tall
iron railing protected them from the street, and on the other side of
the railing an assemblage of Bostonians were trampling about in the
liquid snow. Many of them were looking up and down; they appeared to be
waiting for something. From time to time a strange vehicle drew near to
the place where they stood,--such a vehicle as the lady at the window,
in spite of a considerable acquaintance with human inventions, had
never seen before: a huge, low omnibus, painted in brilliant colors,
and decorated apparently with jangling bells, attached to a species of
groove in the pavement, through which it was dragged, with a great deal
of rumbling, bouncing and scratching, by a couple of remarkably small
horses. When it reached a certain point the people in front of the
grave-yard, of whom much the greater number were women, carrying
satchels and parcels, projected themselves upon it in a compact body--a
movement suggesting the scramble for places in a life-boat at sea--and
were engulfed in its large interior. Then the life-boat--or the
life-car, as the lady at the window of the hotel vaguely designated
it--went bumping and jingling away upon its invisible wheels, with the
helmsman -LRB-the man at the wheel-RRB- guiding its course incongruously from
the prow. This phenomenon was repeated every three minutes, and the
supply of eagerly-moving women in cloaks, bearing reticules and bundles,
renewed itself in the most liberal manner. On the other side of the
grave-yard was a row of small red brick houses, showing a series of
homely, domestic-looking backs; at the end opposite the hotel a tall
wooden church-spire, painted white, rose high into the vagueness of
the snow-flakes. The lady at the window looked at it for some time; for
reasons of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought it the ugliest thing she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had ever seen.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hated it, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) despised it; it threw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) into a state of irritation
that was quite out of proportion to any sensible motive. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had never
known herself to care so much about church-spires.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not pretty; but even when it expressed perplexed irritation her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
face was most interesting and agreeable. Neither was she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
first youth; yet, though slender, with a great deal of extremely
well-fashioned roundness of contour--a suggestion both of maturity and
flexibility--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) three and thirty years as a light-wristed
Hebe might have carried a brimming wine-cup. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) complexion was
fatigued, as the French say; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mouth was large, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips too full, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
teeth uneven, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chin rather commonly modeled; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a thick nose,
and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smiled--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was constantly smiling--the lines beside it
rose too high, toward her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes. But these eyes were charming: gray
in color, brilliant, quickly glancing, gently resting, full of
intelligence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead was very low--it was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only handsome
feature; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a great abundance of crisp dark hair, finely
frizzled, which was always braided in a manner that suggested some
Southern or Eastern, some remotely foreign, woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a large
collection of ear-rings, and wore them in alternation; and they seemed
to give a point to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Oriental or exotic aspect. A compliment had once
been paid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), which, being repeated to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) greater pleasure
than anything she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had ever heard. <div class="bookquote">``A pretty woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone had said.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features are very bad.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features,''  (<font color='red'><b>a observer</b></font>)</div>a
very discerning observer had answered; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carries her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head like a
pretty woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>a observer</b></font>)</div>You may imagine whether, after this, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head
less becomingly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned away from the window at last, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``It's too horrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I shall go back--I shall go back!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flung herself into a chair before the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a little, dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man softly, sketching away
at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little scraps of paper.

<p/>The lady put out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) foot; it was very small, and there was an immense
rosette on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slipper. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes for a while on this ornament,
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at the glowing bed of anthracite coal in the grate.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see anything so hideous as that fire?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Did
you ever see anything so--so _affreux_ as--as everything?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke
English with perfect purity; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brought out this French epithet
in a manner that indicated that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was accustomed to using French
epithets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the fire is very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, glancing at it
a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Those little blue tongues, dancing on top of the crimson
embers, are extremely picturesque. They are like a fire in an
alchemist's laboratory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too good-natured, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion declared.

<p/>The young man held out one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drawings, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head on one side.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue was gently moving along his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) under-lip. <div class="bookquote">``Good-natured--yes.
Too good-natured--no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are irritating,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slipper.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to retouch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sketch. <div class="bookquote">``I think you mean simply that you are
irritated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, for that, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion, with a little bitter laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``It's the darkest day of my life--and you know what that means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait till tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>rejoined the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we have made a great mistake. If there is any doubt about it
today, there certainly will be none tomorrow. _Ce sera clair, au
moins!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>_ The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man was silent a few moments, driving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pencil. Then at
last, <div class="bookquote">``There are no such things as mistakes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affirmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true--for those who are not clever enough to perceive them. Not
to recognize one's mistakes--that would be happiness in life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the lady
went on, still looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man intent</b></font>)</div>said the young man, always intent upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drawing,
<div class="bookquote">``it's the first time you have told me I am not clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man intent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, by your own theory I can't call it a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sister, pertinently enough.

<p/>The young man gave a clear, fresh laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You, at least, are clever
enough, dearest sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not so when I proposed this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it you who proposed it?''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little stare. <div class="bookquote">``Do you desire the
credit of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like, I will take the blame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, looking up with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) rejoined in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``you make no difference in these
things. You have no sense of property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man gave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joyous laugh again. <div class="bookquote">``If that means I have no
property, you are right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't joke about your poverty,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``That is quite as
vulgar as to boast about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poverty! I have just finished a drawing that will bring me fifty
francs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Voyons,'' (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>_ said the lady, putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added a touch or two, and then gave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sketch. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) looked at it,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) idea of a moment before. ``If a woman were to
ask you to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) you would say, `Certainly, my dear, with pleasure!'
And you would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and be ridiculously happy. Then at the end of
three months you would say to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `You know that blissful day when I
begged you to be mine!'''

<p/>The young man had risen from the table, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms a little; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
walked to the window. <div class="bookquote">``That is a description of a charming nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, you have a charming nature; I regard that as our capital. If
I had not been convinced of that I should never have taken the risk of
bringing you to this dreadful country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This comical country, this delightful country!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young
man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broke into the most animated laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it those women scrambling into the omnibus?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you suppose is the attraction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose there is a very good-looking man inside,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In each of them? They come along in hundreds, and the men in this
country don't seem at all handsome. As for the women--I have never seen
so many at once since I left the convent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The women are very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother declared, <div class="bookquote">``and the whole affair
is very amusing. I must make a sketch of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came back to the
table quickly, and picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) utensils--a small sketching-board,
a sheet of paper, and three or four crayons. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place at the
window with these things, and stood there glancing out, plying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pencil with an air of easy skill. While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a
brilliant smile. Brilliant is indeed the word at this moment for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
strongly-lighted face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was eight and twenty years old; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a
short, slight, well-made figure. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore a noticeable resemblance
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a better favored person: fair-haired, clear-faced,
witty-looking, with a delicate finish of feature and an expression at
once urbane and not at all serious, a warm blue eye, an eyebrow finely
drawn and excessively arched--an eyebrow which, if ladies wrote sonnets
to those of their lovers, might have been made the subject of such a
piece of verse--and a light moustache that flourished upwards as if
blown that way by the breath of a constant smile. There was something
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) physiognomy at once benevolent and picturesque. But, as I have
hinted, it was not at all serious. The young man's face was, in this
respect, singular; it was not at all serious, and yet it inspired the
liveliest confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be sure you put in plenty of snow,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``_Bonté divine_,
what a climate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall leave the sketch all white, and I shall put in the little
figures in black,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man answered, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``And I shall call
it--what is that line in Keats?--Mid-May's Eldest Child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, <div class="bookquote">``that mamma ever told me it was like
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma never told you anything disagreeable. And it's not like
this--every day. You will see that tomorrow we shall have a splendid
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Qu’en savez-vous?_ Tomorrow I shall go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where shall you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere away from here. Back to Silberstadt. I shall write to the
Reigning Prince.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man turned a little and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crayon poised.
<div class="bookquote">``My dear Eugenia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``were you so happy at sea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia got up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) still held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) hand the drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) brother had
given her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>). It was a bold, expressive sketch of a group of miserable
people on the deck of a steamer, clinging together and clutching at each
other, while the vessel lurched downward, at a terrific angle, into
the hollow of a wave. It was extremely clever, and full of a sort of
tragi-comical power. Eugenia dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) eyes upon it and made a sad
grimace. <div class="bookquote">``How can you draw such odious scenes?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I should
like to throw it into the fire!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) tossed the paper away. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
brother watched, quietly, to see where it went. It fluttered down to the
floor, where he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) let it lie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) came toward the window, pinching in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) waist. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you reproach me--abuse me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I think
I should feel better then. Why don't you tell me that you hate me for
bringing you here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you would not believe it. I adore you, dear sister! I am
delighted to be here, and I am charmed with the prospect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what had taken possession of me. I had lost my head,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Eugenia went on.

<p/>The young man, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side, went on plying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pencil. <div class="bookquote">``It is evidently
a most curious and interesting country. Here we are, and I mean to enjoy
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion turned away with an impatient step, but presently came
back. <div class="bookquote">``High spirits are doubtless an excellent thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but
you give one too much of them, and I can't see that they have done you
any good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man stared, with lifted eyebrows, smiling; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
handsome nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pencil. <div class="bookquote">``They have made me happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was the least they could do; they have made you nothing else. You
have gone through life thanking fortune for such very small favors that
she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) has never put herself to any trouble for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) must have put herself to a little, I think, to present me with so
admirable a sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be serious, Felix. You forget that I am your elder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With a sister, then, so elderly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>rejoined Felix, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I hoped we
had left seriousness in Europe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy you will find it here. Remember that you are nearly thirty
years old, and that you are nothing but an obscure Bohemian--a penniless
correspondent of an illustrated newspaper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Obscure as much as you please, but not so much of a Bohemian as you
think. And not at all penniless! I have a hundred pounds in my pocket.
I have an engagement to make fifty sketches, and I mean to paint the
portraits of all our cousins, and of all _their_ cousins, at a hundred
dollars a head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not ambitious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are, dear Baroness,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man replied.

<p/>The Baroness was silent a moment, looking out at the sleet-darkened
grave-yard and the bumping horse-cars. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am ambitious,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said
at last. <div class="bookquote">``And my ambition has brought me to this dreadful place!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
glanced about her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)--the room had a certain vulgar nudity; the bed and the
window were curtainless--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) gave a little passionate sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Poor
old ambition!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) exclaimed. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) flung herself down upon a sofa
which stood near against the wall, and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) hands.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) drawing, rapidly and skillfully; after some
moments he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sketch. <div class="bookquote">``Now, don't
you think that's pretty good for an obscure Bohemian?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I have
knocked off another fifty francs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia glanced at the little picture as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) laid it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) lap. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
it is very clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said. And in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose
our cousins do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get into those things, and look like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix meditated awhile. <div class="bookquote">``I really can't say. It will be interesting to
discover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the rich people can't!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very sure they are rich?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>asked Felix, lightly.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister slowly turned in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) place, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Heavenly
powers!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``You have a way of bringing out things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will certainly be much pleasanter if they are rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose if I had not known they were rich I would ever have
come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man met his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister's somewhat peremptory eye with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bright,
contented glance. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it certainly will be pleasanter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is all I expect of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``I don't count upon
their being clever or friendly--at first--or elegant or interesting. But
I assure you I insist upon their being rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head upon the back of the sofa and looked awhile at the
oblong patch of sky to which the window served as frame. The snow was
ceasing; it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the sky had begun to brighten. <div class="bookquote">``I count
upon their being rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``and powerful, and clever, and
friendly, and elegant, and interesting, and generally delightful! _Tu
vas voir_.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent forward and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``Look there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
went on. <div class="bookquote">``As a portent, even while I speak, the sky is turning the color
of gold; the day is going to be splendid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And indeed, within five minutes the weather had changed. The sun broke
out through the snow-clouds and jumped into the Baroness's room. <div class="bookquote">``_Bonté
divine_,''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed this lady, <div class="bookquote">``what a climate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go out and see the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/>And after a while they went out. The air had grown warm as well as
brilliant; the sunshine had dried the pavements. They walked about the
streets at hazard, looking at the people and the houses, the shops and
the vehicles, the blazing blue sky and the muddy crossings, the hurrying
men and the slow-strolling maidens, the fresh red bricks and the bright
green trees, the extraordinary mixture of smartness and shabbiness.
From one hour to another the day had grown vernal; even in the bustling
streets there was an odor of earth and blossom. Felix was immensely
entertained. He (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had called it a comical country, and he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) went about
laughing at everything he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) saw. You would have said that American
civilization expressed itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) sense in a tissue of capital jokes.
The jokes were certainly excellent, and the young man's merriment was
joyous and genial. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possessed what is called the pictorial sense;
and this first glimpse of democratic manners stirred the same sort of
attention that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have given to the movements of a lively
young person with a bright complexion. Such attention would have been
demonstrative and complimentary; and in the present case Felix might
have passed for an undispirited young exile revisiting the haunts of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) childhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept looking at the violent blue of the sky, at the
scintillating air, at the scattered and multiplied patches of color.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Comme c’est bariolé_, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister in that foreign
tongue which they both appeared to feel a mysterious prompting
occasionally to use.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is _bariolé_ indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness answered. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like the
coloring; it hurts my eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shows how extremes meet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``Instead of coming
to the West we seem to have gone to the East. The way the sky touches
the house-tops is just like Cairo; and the red and blue sign-boards
patched over the face of everything remind one of Mahometan
decorations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The young women are not Mahometan,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``They can't be
said to hide their faces. I never saw anything so bold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank Heaven they don't hide their faces!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix. <div class="bookquote">``Their faces
are uncommonly pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, their faces are often very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, who was
a very clever woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was too clever a woman not to be capable of
a great deal of just and fine observation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) clung more closely than
usual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother's arm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was not exhilarated, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said
very little, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) noted a great many things and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) reflections.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was a little excited; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had indeed come to a strange
country, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) fortune. Superficially, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was conscious of a good
deal of irritation and displeasure; the Baroness was a very delicate
and fastidious person. Of old, more than once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had gone, for
entertainment's sake and in brilliant company, to a fair in a provincial
town. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was at an enormous fair--that the
entertainment and the _désagréments_ were very much the same. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) found
herself alternately smiling and shrinking; the show was very curious,
but it was probable, from moment to moment, that one would be jostled.
The Baroness had never seen so many people walking about before; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
had never been so mixed up with people she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) did not know. But little by
little she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) felt that this fair was a more serious undertaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) went
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother into a large public garden, which seemed very pretty,
but where she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was surprised at seeing no carriages. The afternoon was
drawing to a close; the coarse, vivid grass and the slender tree-boles
were gilded by the level sunbeams--gilded as with gold that was fresh
from the mine. It was the hour at which ladies should come out for an
airing and roll past a hedge of pedestrians, holding their parasols
askance. Here, however, Eugenia observed no indications of this custom,
the absence of which was more anomalous as there was a charming avenue
of remarkably graceful, arching elms in the most convenient contiguity
to a large, cheerful street, in which, evidently, among the more
prosperous members of the _bourgeoisie_, a great deal of pedestrianism
went forward. Our friends passed out into this well lighted promenade,
and Felix noticed a great many more pretty girls and called his (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) sister's
attention to them. This latter measure, however, was superfluous; for
the Baroness had inspected, narrowly, these charming young ladies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel an intimate conviction that our cousins are like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said
Felix.

<p/>The Baroness hoped so, but this is not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They are very
pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but they are mere little girls. Where are the
women--the women of thirty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of thirty-three, do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother was going to ask; for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
understood often both what she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) did not say. But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
only exclaimed upon the beauty of the sunset, while the Baroness, who
had come to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) fortune, reflected that it would certainly be well
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) if the persons against whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) might need to measure herself
should all be mere little girls. The sunset was superb; they stopped
to look at it; Felix declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never seen such a gorgeous
mixture of colors. The Baroness also thought it splendid; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was
perhaps the more easily pleased from the fact that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) stood there
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was conscious of much admiring observation on the part of various
nice-looking people who passed that way, and to whom a distinguished,
strikingly-dressed woman with a foreign air, exclaiming upon the
beauties of nature on a Boston street corner in the French tongue,
could not be an object of indifference. Eugenia's spirits rose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
surrendered herself to a certain tranquil gaiety. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had come to
seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) fortune, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) fortune would be easy to
find. There was a promise of it in the gorgeous purity of the western
sky; there was an intimation in the mild, unimpertinent gaze of the
passers of a certain natural facility in things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not go back to Silberstadt, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>asked Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor write to the Reigning Prince?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) that they evidently know nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) over
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) will not believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">``I advise you to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix himself continued to be in high good humor. Brought up among
ancient customs and in picturesque cities, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yet found plenty of local
color in the little Puritan metropolis. That evening, after dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should go forth early on the morrow to look up
their cousins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very impatient,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can be more natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``after seeing all those pretty
girls today? If one's cousins are of that pattern, the sooner one knows
them the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they are not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia. <div class="bookquote">``We ought to have brought some
letters--to some other people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The other people would not be our kinsfolk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly they would be none the worse for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness replied.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyebrows lifted. <div class="bookquote">``That was not what
you said when you first proposed to me that we should come out here and
fraternize with our relatives. You said that it was the prompting of
natural affection; and when I suggested some reasons against it you
declared that the _voix du sang_ should go before everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember all that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vividly! I was greatly moved by it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was walking up and down the room, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had done in the morning;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) walk and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) apparently was
going to say something, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) checked herself and resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) walk.
Then, in a few moments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said something different, which had the
effect of an explanation of the suppression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) earlier thought. <div class="bookquote">``You
will never be anything but a child, dear brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One would suppose that you, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>answered Felix, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``were a
thousand years old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am--sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go, then, and announce to our cousins the arrival of a
personage so extraordinary. They will immediately come and pay you their
respects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia paced the length of the room again, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) stopped before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) brother, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``They are not to come and see
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You are not to allow that. That is not the way I shall
meet them first.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) interrogative glance she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) went on.
<div class="bookquote">``You will go and examine, and report. You will come back and tell me
who they are and what they are; their number, gender, their respective
ages--all about them. Be sure you observe everything; be ready to
describe to me the locality, the accessories--how shall I say
it?--the _mise en scène_. Then, at my own time, at my own hour, under
circumstances of my own choosing, I will go to them. I will present
myself--I will appear before them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, this time
phrasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) idea with a certain frankness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what message am I to take to them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>asked Felix, who had a lively
faith in the justness of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister's arrangements.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a moment--at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) expression of agreeable veracity;
and, with that justness that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) admired, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Say what you
please. Tell my story in the way that seems to you most--natural.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) forehead for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to kiss.



<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>The next day was splendid, as Felix had prophesied; if the winter had
suddenly leaped into spring, the spring had for the moment as quickly
leaped into summer. This was an observation made by a young girl who
came out of a large square house in the country, and strolled about in
the spacious garden which separated it from a muddy road. The flowering
shrubs and the neatly-disposed plants were basking in the abundant
light and warmth; the transparent shade of the great elms--they were
magnificent trees--seemed to thicken by the hour; and the intensely
habitual stillness offered a submissive medium to the sound of a distant
church-bell. The young girl listened to the church-bell; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not
dressed for church. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bare-headed; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore a white muslin waist,
with an embroidered border, and the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dress was of colored
muslin. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a young lady of some two or three and twenty years
of age, and though a young person of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sex walking bare-headed in
a garden, of a Sunday morning in spring-time, can, in the nature of
things, never be a displeasing object, you would not have pronounced
this innocent Sabbath-breaker especially pretty. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was tall and pale,
thin and a little awkward; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair was fair and perfectly straight; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
eyes were dark, and they had the singularity of seeming at once dull
and restless--differing herein, as you see, fatally from the ideal <div class="bookquote">``fine
eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>which we always imagine to be both brilliant and tranquil. The
doors and windows of the large square house were all wide open, to admit
the purifying sunshine, which lay in generous patches upon the floor
of a wide, high, covered piazza adjusted to two sides of the mansion--a
piazza on which several straw-bottomed rocking-chairs and half a dozen
of those small cylindrical stools in green and blue porcelain, which
suggest an affiliation between the residents and the Eastern trade, were
symmetrically disposed. It was an ancient house--ancient in the sense
of being eighty years old; it was built of wood, painted a clean, clear,
faded gray, and adorned along the front, at intervals, with flat wooden
pilasters, painted white. These pilasters appeared to support a kind of
classic pediment, which was decorated in the middle by a large triple
window in a boldly carved frame, and in each of its smaller angles by
a glazed circular aperture. A large white door, furnished with a
highly-polished brass knocker, presented itself to the rural-looking
road, with which it was connected by a spacious pathway, paved with worn
and cracked, but very clean, bricks. Behind it there were meadows and
orchards, a barn and a pond; and facing it, a short distance along the
road, on the opposite side, stood a smaller house, painted white, with
external shutters painted green, a little garden on one hand and an
orchard on the other. All this was shining in the morning air, through
which the simple details of the picture addressed themselves to the eye
as distinctly as the items of a <div class="bookquote">``sum''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in addition.

<p/>A second young lady presently came out of the house, across the piazza,
descended into the garden and approached the young girl of whom I have
spoken. This second young lady was also thin and pale; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was older
than the other; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was shorter; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had dark, smooth hair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes,
unlike the other's, were quick and bright; but they were not at all
restless. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wore a straw bonnet with white ribbons, and a long, red,
India scarf, which, on the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress, reached to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feet. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carried a little key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``are you very sure you had better not go to
church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) a moment, plucked a small sprig from a
lilac-bush, smelled it and threw it away. <div class="bookquote">``I am not very sure of
anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) answered.

<p/>The other young lady looked straight past her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), at the distant pond,
which lay shining between the long banks of fir trees. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said in
a very soft voice, <div class="bookquote">``This is the key of the dining-room closet. I think
you had better have it, if anyone should want anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is there to want anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude demanded. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be all
alone in the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Someone may come,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean Mr. Brand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Gertrude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) may like a piece of cake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like men that are always eating cake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude declared,
giving a pull at the lilac-bush.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) companion glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), and then looked down on the ground. <div class="bookquote">``I
think father expected you would come to church,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What shall I
say to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say I have a bad headache.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would that be true?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the elder lady, looking straight at the pond
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said the younger one simply.

<p/>Charlotte transferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) quiet eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion's face. <div class="bookquote">``I am
afraid you are feeling restless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am feeling as I always feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude replied, in the same tone.

<p/>Charlotte turned away; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stood there a moment. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
looked down at the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dress. <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it seem to you, somehow,
as if my scarf were too long?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Gertrude walked half round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), looking at the scarf. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you
wear it right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I wear it, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; differently from that. You should draw it differently
over your shoulders, round your elbows; you should look differently
behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I look?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, plucking out the scarf
a little behind. <div class="bookquote">``I could do it myself, but I don't think I can explain
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte, by a movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) elbows, corrected the laxity that had
come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion's touch. <div class="bookquote">``Well, some day you must do it for me.
It doesn't matter now. Indeed, I don't think it matters,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``how one looks behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say it mattered more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``Then you don't know who
may be observing you. You are not on your guard. You can't try to look
pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte received this declaration with extreme gravity. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think
one should ever try to look pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rejoined, earnestly.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion was silent. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps it's not of much
use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a little, and then kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will
be better when we come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sister, I am very well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/>Charlotte went down the large brick walk to the garden gate; her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
companion strolled slowly toward the house. At the gate Charlotte met a
young man, who was coming in--a tall, fair young man, wearing a high hat
and a pair of thread gloves. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was handsome, but rather too stout. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had a pleasant smile. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Brand!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to see whether your sister was not going to church,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the
young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is not going; but I am very glad you have come. I think if
you were to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a little'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>... And Charlotte lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``It seems as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were restless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand smiled down on the young lady from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) great height. <div class="bookquote">``I shall
be very glad to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). For that I should be willing to absent
myself from almost any occasion of worship, however attractive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, softly, as if positive
acceptance of this proposition might be dangerous. <div class="bookquote">``But I am afraid I
shall be late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will have a pleasant sermon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Gilman is always pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte answered. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) way.

<p/>Mr. Brand went into the garden, where Gertrude, hearing the gate close
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>), turned and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>). For a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
coming; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) turned away. But almost immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) corrected this
movement, and stood still, facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hat and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
forehead as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) approached. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hat again and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
hand. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hat being removed, you would have perceived that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) forehead
was very large and smooth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hair abundant but rather colorless.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) nose was too large, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) mouth and eyes were too small; but for
all this he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was, as I have said, a young man of striking appearance. The
expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little clean-colored blue eyes was irresistibly gentle
and serious; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked, as the phrase is, as good as gold. The young
girl, standing in the garden path, glanced, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came up, at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thread
gloves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hoped you were going to church,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to walk with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude answered. <div class="bookquote">``I am not going to
church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had shaken hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) hand a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Have you any
special reason for not going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Brand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the young girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask what it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiling; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) smile, as I have intimated, there
was a certain dullness. But mingled with this dullness was something
sweet and suggestive. <div class="bookquote">``Because the sky is so blue!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at the sky, which was magnificent, and then said, smiling too,
<div class="bookquote">``I have heard of young ladies staying at home for bad weather, but
never for good. Your sister, whom I met at the gate, tells me you are
depressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Depressed? I am never depressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, surely, sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brand, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) thought this a
regrettable account of one's self.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am never depressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude repeated. <div class="bookquote">``But I am sometimes wicked.
When I am wicked I am in high spirits. I was wicked just now to my
sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you do to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said things that puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you do that, Miss Gertrude?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the young man.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) began to smile again. <div class="bookquote">``Because the sky is so blue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say things that puzzle _me_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always know when I do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>proceeded Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``But people puzzle me
more, I think. And they don't seem to know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand observed, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You told me to tell you about my--my struggles,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl went
on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us talk about them. I have so many things to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude turned away a moment; and then, turning back, <div class="bookquote">``You had better
go to church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man urged, <div class="bookquote">``that I have always one thing to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Please don't say it now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat; <div class="bookquote">``all alone in this
beautiful Sunday stillness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), at the breaking buds, the shining
distance, the blue sky to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had referred as a pretext for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
irregularities. <div class="bookquote">``That's the reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``why I don't want you to
speak. Do me a favor; go to church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I speak when I come back?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Brand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are still disposed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether you are wicked,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but you are certainly
puzzling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had turned away; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) slowly walked to church.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wandered for a while about the garden, vaguely and without purpose.
The church-bell had stopped ringing; the stillness was complete. This
young lady relished highly, on occasions, the sense of being alone--the
absence of the whole family and the emptiness of the house. Today,
apparently, the servants had also gone to church; there was never a
figure at the open windows; behind the house there was no stout negress
in a red turban, lowering the bucket into the great shingle-hooded
well. And the front door of the big, unguarded home stood open, with
the trustfulness of the golden age; or what is more to the purpose, with
that of New England's silvery prime. Gertrude slowly passed through it,
and went from one of the empty rooms to the other--large, clear-colored
rooms, with white wainscots, ornamented with thin-legged mahogany
furniture, and, on the walls, with old-fashioned engravings, chiefly of
scriptural subjects, hung very high. This agreeable sense of solitude,
of having the house to herself, of which I have spoken, always excited
Gertrude's imagination; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) could not have told you why, and neither can
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) humble historian. It always seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) must do something
particular--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) must honor the occasion; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) roamed
about, wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) could do, the occasion usually came to an end.
Today she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wondered more than ever. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) took down a book; there
was no library in the house, but there were books in all the rooms. None
of them were forbidden books, and Gertrude had not stopped at home for
the sake of a chance to climb to the inaccessible shelves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) possessed
herself of a very obvious volume--one of the series of the _Arabian
Nights_--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) brought it out into the portico and sat down with it
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) lap. There, for a quarter of an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) read the history of
the loves of the Prince Camaralzaman and the Princess Badoura. At last,
looking up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) beheld, as it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), the Prince Camaralzaman
standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>). A beautiful young man was making her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) a very low
bow--a magnificent bow, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had never seen before. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared
to have dropped from the clouds; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wonderfully handsome; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
smiled--smiled as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were smiling on purpose. Extreme surprise, for a
moment, kept Gertrude sitting still; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) rose, without even keeping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) finger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) book. The young man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, still
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), smiling and smiling. It was very strange.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you kindly tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>said the mysterious visitor, at last,
<div class="bookquote">``whether I have the honor of speaking to Miss Wentworth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Gertrude Wentworth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>murmured the young woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then--then--I have the honor--the pleasure--of being your cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man had so much the character of an apparition that this
announcement seemed to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unreality. <div class="bookquote">``What cousin? Who are
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped back a few paces and looked up at the house; then glanced
round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the garden and the distant view. After this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) burst out
laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I see it must seem to you very strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. There was,
after all, something substantial in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughter. Gertrude looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
from head to foot. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was remarkably handsome; but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smile was
almost a grimace. <div class="bookquote">``It is very still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, coming nearer again.
And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) only looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Are you all alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone has gone to church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``But I hope you are not
afraid of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to tell me who you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">``I had a different plan. I
expected the servant would take in my card, and that you would put your
heads together, before admitting me, and make out my identity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude had been wondering with a quick intensity which brought
its result; and the result seemed an answer--a wondrous, delightful
answer--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) vague wish that something would befall her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know--I
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You come from Europe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We came two days ago. You have heard of us, then--you believe in us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have known, vaguely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, <div class="bookquote">``that we had relations in
France.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you ever wanted to see us?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the young man.

<p/>Gertrude was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I have wanted to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad, then, it is you I have found. We wanted to see you, so we
came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On purpose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Gertrude.

<p/>The young man looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), smiling still. <div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; on purpose.
Does that sound as if we should bore you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think we
shall--I really don't think we shall. We are rather fond of wandering,
too; and we were glad of a pretext.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have just arrived?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Boston, two days ago. At the inn I asked for Mr. Wentworth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) must
be your father. They found out for me where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) lived; they seemed often
to have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>). I determined to come, without ceremony. So, this
lovely morning, they set my face in the right direction, and told me to
walk straight before me, out of town. I came on foot because I wanted
to see the country. I walked and walked, and here I am! It's a good many
miles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is seven miles and a half,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, softly. Now that this
handsome young man was proving himself a reality she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) found herself
vaguely trembling; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was deeply excited. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) life
spoken to a foreigner, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had often thought it would be delightful
to do so. Here was one who had suddenly been engendered by the Sabbath
stillness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) private use; and such a brilliant, polite, smiling
one! She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) found time and means to compose herself, however: to remind
herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) must exercise a sort of official hospitality. <div class="bookquote">``We are
very--very glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you come into the house?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) moved toward the open door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not afraid of me, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the young man again, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
light laugh.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wondered a moment, and then, <div class="bookquote">``We are not afraid--here,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.

<p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Ah, comme vous devez avoir raison!'' (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>_ cried the young man, looking all
round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), appreciatively. It was the first time that Gertrude had heard
so many words of French spoken. They gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) something of a sensation.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) companion followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), watching, with a certain excitement of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
own, this tall, interesting-looking girl, dressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clear, crisp
muslin. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) paused in the hall, where there was a broad white staircase
with a white balustrade. <div class="bookquote">``What a pleasant house!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's lighter
inside than it is out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's pleasanter here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) led the way into the
parlor,--a high, clean, rather empty-looking room. Here they stood
looking at each other,--the young man smiling more than ever; Gertrude,
very serious, trying to smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you know my name,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am called Felix Young.
Your father is my uncle. My mother was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) half sister, and older than
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned Roman Catholic and married in
Europe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) married and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died. Your
father's family didn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband. They called him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a foreigner;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not. My poor father was born in Sicily, but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) parents were
American.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Sicily?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix Young, <div class="bookquote">``that they had spent their lives in
Europe. But they were very patriotic. And so are we.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are Sicilian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sicilian, no! Let's see. I was born at a little place--a dear little
place--in France. My sister was born at Vienna.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are French,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man. Gertrude's eyes were fixed upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost insistently. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to laugh again. <div class="bookquote">``I can easily be
French, if that will please you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a foreigner of some sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of some sort--yes; I suppose so. But who can say of what sort? I don't
think we have ever had occasion to settle the question. You know
there are people like that. About their country, their religion, their
profession, they can't tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude stood there gazing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had not asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to sit down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
had never heard of people like that; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wanted to hear. <div class="bookquote">``Where do you
live?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They can't tell that, either!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you will
think they are little better than vagabonds. I have lived
anywhere--everywhere. I really think I have lived in every city in
Europe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude gave a little long soft exhalation. It made the young
man smile at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) again; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smile made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) blush a little. To take
refuge from blushing she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if, after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long walk, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
hungry or thirsty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) hand was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) pocket; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was fumbling with the
little key that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands a little, <div class="bookquote">``if you could give me, in charity, a
glass of wine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude gave a smile and a little nod, and went quickly out of the
room. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) came back with a very large decanter in one hand
and a plate in the other, on which was placed a big, round cake with
a frosted top. Gertrude, in taking the cake from the closet, had had a
moment of acute consciousness that it composed the refection of which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister had thought that Mr. Brand would like to partake. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) kinsman
from across the seas was looking at the pale, high-hung engravings. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) came in he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) turned and smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), as if they had been old friends
meeting after a separation. <div class="bookquote">``You wait upon me yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I am
served like the gods!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had waited upon a great many people, but
none of them had ever told her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) that. The observation added a certain
lightness to the step with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) went to a little table where there
were some curious red glasses--glasses covered with little gold sprigs,
which Charlotte used to dust every morning with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own hands. Gertrude
thought the glasses very handsome, and it was a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) to know
that the wine was good; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father's famous madeira. Felix Young
thought it excellent; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been told that there was
no wine in America. She (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) cut him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) an immense triangle out of the cake, and
again she (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) thought of Mr. Brand. Felix sat there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) glass in
one hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) huge morsel of cake in the other--eating, drinking,
smiling, talking. <div class="bookquote">``I am very hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am not at all tired; I
am never tired. But I am very hungry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must stay to dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``At two o’clock. They will all
have come back from church; you will see the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are the others?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the young man. <div class="bookquote">``Describe them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will see for yourself. It is you that must tell me; now, about your
sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister is the Baroness Münster,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/>On hearing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) sister was a Baroness, Gertrude got up and walked
about slowly, in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was silent a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was thinking
of it. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) come, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) did come; she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) is in Boston, at the hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) begs you will not!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man replied. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) sends you her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) love;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) sent me to announce her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) will come and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) respects to your
father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude felt herself trembling again. A Baroness Münster, who sent a
brilliant young man to <div class="bookquote">``announce''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>); who was coming, as the Queen
of Sheba came to Solomon, to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Sheba</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``respects''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon</b></font>)</div>to quiet Mr.
Wentworth--such a personage presented herself to Gertrude's vision with
a most effective unexpectedness. For a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) hardly knew what to
say. <div class="bookquote">``When will she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as you will allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>)--tomorrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) is very impatient,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>answered Felix, who wished to be agreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wished to ask more about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>); but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) hardly knew what could be predicated of a Baroness Münster. <div class="bookquote">``Is
she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>)--is she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>)--married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) cake and wine; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) got up, fixing upon the
young girl his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) bright, expressive eyes. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) is married to a German
prince--Prince Adolf, of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is not the
reigning prince; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is a younger brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) informant; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) lips were slightly parted. <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>)
a--a _Princess_?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man; <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) position is rather a singular one.
It's a morganatic marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Morganatic?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>These were new names and new words to poor Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what they call a marriage, you know, contracted between a
scion of a ruling house and--and a common mortal. They made Eugenia a
Baroness, poor woman; but that was all they could do. Now they want to
dissolve the marriage. Prince Adolf, between ourselves, is a ninny; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) brother, who is a clever man, has plans for him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). Eugenia, naturally
enough, makes difficulties; not, however, that I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) cares
much--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)'s a very clever woman; I'm sure you'll like her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) wants
to bother them. Just now everything is _en l’air_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>visitor tale</b></font>)</div><p/>The cheerful, off-hand tone in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) visitor related this darkly
romantic tale seemed to Gertrude very strange; but it seemed also to
convey a certain flattery to herself, a recognition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wisdom and
dignity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) felt a dozen impressions stirring within her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), and presently
the one that was uppermost found words. <div class="bookquote">``They want to dissolve her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
marriage?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it appears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And against her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Against her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) must be very unhappy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) visitor looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), smiling; he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) hand to the back of
his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) head and held it there a moment. <div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) says,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``That's
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) told me to tell it you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I will leave that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) does it better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) little excited sigh again. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) is unhappy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) has come to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had been so interested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) failed to notice the sound of a
footstep in the portico; and yet it was a footstep that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) always
recognized. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) heard it in the hall, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked out of the
window. They were all coming back from church--her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister
and brother, and their cousins, who always came to dinner on Sunday.
Mr. Brand had come in first; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was in advance of the others, because,
apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was still disposed to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had not wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) to
say an hour before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) came into the parlor, looking for Gertrude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
had two little books in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hand. On seeing Gertrude's companion he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
slowly stopped, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this a cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>asked Felix.

<p/>Then Gertrude saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) must introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) ears, and, by
sympathy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) lips, were full of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had been telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This
is the Prince,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the Prince of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix burst out laughing, and Mr. Brand stood staring, while the others,
who had passed into the house, appeared behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) in the open doorway.



<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>That evening at dinner Felix Young gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) sister, the Baroness
Münster, an account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) impressions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had come back in
the highest possible spirits; but this fact, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) own mind, was not a
reason for rejoicing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) had but a limited confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) brother's
judgment; his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) capacity for taking rose-colored views was such as to
vulgarize one of the prettiest of tints. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could
be trusted to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) the mere facts; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) invited him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with some
eagerness to communicate them. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose, at least, they didn't turn
you out from the door;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You have been away some ten hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn me from the door!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``They took me to their hearts;
they killed the fatted calf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what you want to say: they are a collection of angels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``They are a collection of angels--simply.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_C’est bien vague_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>remarked the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``What are they like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like nothing you ever saw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I am much obliged; but that is hardly more definite.
Seriously, they were glad to see you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enchanted. It has been the proudest day of my life. Never, never have I
been so lionized! I assure you, I was cock of the walk. My dear sister,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man qu</b></font>)</div>said the young man, <div class="bookquote">``_nous n’avons qu'à nous tenir_; we shall be great
swells!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man qu</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Münster looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) eye exhibited a slight responsive
spark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) lips to a glass of wine, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Describe them. Give me a picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix drained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own glass. <div class="bookquote">``Well, it's in the country, among the
meadows and woods; a wild sort of place, and yet not far from here.
Only, such a road, my dear! Imagine one of the Alpine glaciers
reproduced in mud. But you will not spend much time on it, for they want
you to come and stay, once for all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, <div class="bookquote">``they want me to come and stay, once for all?
_Bon_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's intensely rural, tremendously natural; and all overhung with
this strange white light, this far-away blue sky. There's a big wooden
house--a kind of three-story bungalow; it looks like a magnified
Nuremberg toy. There was a gentleman there that made a speech to me
about it and called it a `venerable mansion;' but it looks as if it had
been built last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it handsome--is it elegant?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness.

<p/>Felix looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a moment, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``It's very clean! No splendors,
no gilding, no troops of servants; rather straight-backed chairs. But
you might eat off the floors, and you can sit down on the stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That must be a privilege. And the inhabitants are straight-backed too,
of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``the inhabitants are charming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what style?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a style of their own. How shall I describe it? It's primitive; it's
patriarchal; it's the _ton_ of the golden age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have they nothing golden but their _ton_? Are there no symptoms of
wealth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say there was wealth without symptoms. A plain, homely way of
life: nothing for show, and very little for--what shall I call it?--for
the senses; but a great _aisance_, and a lot of money, out of sight,
that comes forward very quietly for subscriptions to institutions,
for repairing tenements, for paying doctor's bills; perhaps even for
portioning daughters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the daughters?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Münster demanded. <div class="bookquote">``How many are there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two, Charlotte and Gertrude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man was silent, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said at
last.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in return. <div class="bookquote">``I see. You are in love with Gertrude. They
must be Puritans to their finger-tips; anything but gay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, they are not gay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix admitted. <div class="bookquote">``They are sober; they are even
severe. They are of a pensive cast; they take things hard. I think there
is something the matter with them; they have some melancholy memory
or some depressing expectation. It's not the epicurean temperament. My
uncle, Mr. Wentworth, is a tremendously high-toned old fellow; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looks
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) were undergoing martyrdom, not by fire, but by freezing. But we
shall cheer them up; we shall do them good. They will take a good deal
of stirring up; but they are wonderfully kind and gentle. And they are
appreciative. They think one clever; they think one remarkable!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very fine, so far as it goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``But are we
to be shut up to these three people, Mr. Wentworth and the two young
women--what did you say their names were--Deborah and Hephzibah?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; there is another little girl, a cousin of theirs, a very pretty
creature; a thorough little American. And then there is the son of the
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``We are coming to the gentlemen. What of the
son of the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) gets tipsy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), then, has the epicurean temperament! How old is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is a boy of twenty; a pretty young fellow, but I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has
vulgar tastes. And then there is Mr. Brand--a very tall young man, a
sort of lay-priest. They seem to think a good deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>), but I don't
exactly make him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is there nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness, <div class="bookquote">``between these
extremes--this mysterious ecclesiastic and that intemperate youth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, there is Mr. Acton. I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, with a nod
at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``that you will like Mr. Acton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember that I am very fastidious,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) very
good manners?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) will have them with you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) is a man of the world; he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) has been to
China.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Münster gave a little laugh. <div class="bookquote">``A man of the Chinese world! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must
be very interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought home a fortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is always interesting. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young, good-looking, clever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is less than forty; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a baldish head; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says witty things. I
rather think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>added the young man, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will admire the Baroness
Münster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>said this lady. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother never knew how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
would take things; but shortly afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had made
a very pretty description and that on the morrow she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would go and see
for herself.

<p/>They mounted, accordingly, into a great barouche--a vehicle as to which
the Baroness found nothing to criticise but the price that was asked
for it and the fact that the coachman wore a straw hat. -LRB-At Silberstadt
Madame Münster had had liveries of yellow and crimson.-RRB- They drove
into the country, and the Baroness, leaning far back and swaying her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
lace-fringed parasol, looked to right and to left and surveyed the
way-side objects. After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) pronounced them _affreux_.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother remarked that it was apparently a country in which the
foreground was inferior to the _plans reculés_; and the Baroness
rejoined that the landscape seemed to be all foreground. Felix had fixed
with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) new friends the hour at which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should bring his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister; it
was four o’clock in the afternoon. The large, clean-faced house wore,
to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyes, as the barouche drove up to it, a very friendly aspect; the
high, slender elms made lengthening shadows in front of it. The Baroness
descended; her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) American kinsfolk were stationed in the portico. Felix
waved his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hat to them, and a tall, lean gentleman, with a high forehead
and a clean shaven face, came forward toward the garden gate. Charlotte
Wentworth walked at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) side. Gertrude came behind, more slowly. Both of
these young ladies wore rustling silk dresses. Felix ushered his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sister
into the gate. <div class="bookquote">``Be very gracious,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saw the
admonition was superfluous. Eugenia was prepared to be gracious as
only Eugenia could be. Felix knew no keener pleasure than to be able to
admire his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sister unrestrictedly; for if the opportunity was frequent,
it was not inveterate. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) desired to please she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), as to
everyone else, the most charming woman in the world. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) forgot that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was ever anything else; that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sometimes hard and perverse;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was occasionally afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm to pass
into the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desired, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) proposed, to please,
and this situation made him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) very happy. Eugenia would please.

<p/>The tall gentleman came to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>), looking very rigid and grave. But
it was a rigidity that had no illiberal meaning. Mr. Wentworth's manner
was pregnant, on the contrary, with a sense of grand responsibility, of
the solemnity of the occasion, of its being difficult to show sufficient
deference to a lady at once so distinguished and so unhappy. Felix
had observed on the day before his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) characteristic pallor; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
perceived that there was something almost cadaverous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle's
high-featured white face. But so clever were this young man's quick
sympathies and perceptions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) already learned that in these
semi-mortuary manifestations there was no cause for alarm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) light
imagination had gained a glimpse of Mr. Wentworth's spiritual mechanism,
and taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) that, the old man being infinitely conscientious, the
special operation of conscience within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) announced itself by several
of the indications of physical faintness.

<p/>The Baroness took her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) uncle's hand, and stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
ugly face and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) beautiful smile. <div class="bookquote">``Have I done right to come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very right, very right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, solemnly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had arranged
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) mind a little speech; but now it quite faded away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) felt almost
frightened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had never been looked at in just that way--with just that
fixed, intense smile--by any woman; and it perplexed and weighed upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), now, that the woman who was smiling so and who had instantly given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) a vivid sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) possessing other unprecedented attributes, was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own niece, the child of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own father's daughter. The idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
niece should be a German Baroness, married <div class="bookquote">``morganatically''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>to a Prince,
had already given him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) much to think about. Was it right, was it just,
was it acceptable? He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) always slept badly, and the night before he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
lain awake much more even than usual, asking himself these questions.
The strange word <div class="bookquote">``morganatic''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was constantly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) ears; it reminded
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) of a certain Mrs. Morgan whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had once known and who had been a
bold, unpleasant woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had a feeling that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) duty, so long
as the Baroness looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), smiling in that way, to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) glance
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own scrupulously adjusted, consciously frigid organs of vision;
but on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) failed to perform his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) duty to the last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
looked away toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) daughters. <div class="bookquote">``We are very glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
said. <div class="bookquote">``Allow me to introduce my daughters--Miss Charlotte Wentworth,
Miss Gertrude Wentworth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had never seen people less demonstrative.
But Charlotte kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hand, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sweetly and
solemnly. Gertrude seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) almost funereal, though Gertrude
might have found a source of gaiety in the fact that Felix, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
magnificent smile, had been talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) as a
very old friend. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) kissed the Baroness she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) eyes.
Madame Münster took each of these young women by the hand, and looked at
them all over. Charlotte thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) very strange-looking and singularly
dressed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not have said whether it was well or ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
glad, at any rate, that they had put on their silk gowns--especially
Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``My cousins are very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
eyes from one to the other. <div class="bookquote">``Your daughters are very handsome, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte blushed quickly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had never yet heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) personal
appearance alluded to in a loud, expressive voice. Gertrude looked
away--not at Felix; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was extremely pleased. It was not the compliment
that pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) did not believe it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) thought herself very
plain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) could hardly have told you the source of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) satisfaction;
it came from something in the way the Baroness spoke, and it was not
diminished--it was rather deepened, oddly enough--by the young girl's
disbelief. Mr. Wentworth was silent; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) asked, formally, <div class="bookquote">``Won't
you come into the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are not all; you have some other children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) come to meet me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Eugenia cried. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is
not so charming as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; I will see about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is rather afraid of ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte said, softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is very handsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, as loud as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go in and find him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). We will draw him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) _cachette_.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>And the Baroness took Mr. Wentworth's arm, who was not aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
offered it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), and who, as they walked toward the house, wondered
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) ought to have offered it and whether it was proper for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) to
take it if it had not been offered. <div class="bookquote">``I want to know you well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the
Baroness, interrupting these meditations, <div class="bookquote">``and I want you to know me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems natural that we should know each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth
rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``We are near relatives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there comes a moment in life when one reverts, irresistibly, to
one's natural ties--to one's natural affections. You must have found
that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia.

<p/>Mr. Wentworth had been told the day before by Felix that Eugenia was
very clever, very brilliant, and the information had held him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) in some
suspense. This was the cleverness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) supposed; the brilliancy was
beginning. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, the natural affections are very strong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In some people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness declared. <div class="bookquote">``Not in all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte was
walking beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) hand again, smiling always.
<div class="bookquote">``And you, _cousine_, where did you get that enchanting complexion?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``such lilies and roses?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The roses in poor Charlotte's
countenance began speedily to predominate over the lilies, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) step and reached the portico. <div class="bookquote">``This is the country
of complexions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness continued, addressing herself to Mr.
Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``I am convinced they are more delicate. There are very good
ones in England--in Holland; but they are very apt to be coarse. There
is too much red.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you will find,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, <div class="bookquote">``that this country is
superior in many respects to those you mention. I have been to England
and Holland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have been to Europe?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>cried the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you come
and see me? But it's better, after all, this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said. They were
entering the house; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) paused and looked round her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I see you have
arranged your house--your beautiful house--in the--in the Dutch taste!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The house is very old,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr. Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``General Washington
once spent a week here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have heard of Washington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>cried the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``My father used to
tell me of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth was silent a moment, and then, <div class="bookquote">``I found he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very well
known in Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said.

<p/>Felix had lingered in the garden with Gertrude; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was standing before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) and smiling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had done the day before. What had happened the
day before seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a kind of dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had been there and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
changed everything; the others had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), they had talked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>);
but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should come again, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should be part of the future,
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) small, familiar, much-meditating life--this needed, afresh,
the evidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) senses. The evidence had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) senses now;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) senses seemed to rejoice in it. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think of Eugenia?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix asked. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) charming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) is very brilliant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``But I can't tell yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) seems
to me like a singer singing an air. You can't tell till the song is
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, the song will never be done!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young man, laughing.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you think her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) handsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude had been disappointed in the beauty of the Baroness Münster;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), for mysterious reasons, to resemble a very pretty
portrait of the Empress Josephine, of which there hung an engraving
in one of the parlors, and which the younger Miss Wentworth had always
greatly admired. But the Baroness was not at all like that--not at all.
Though different, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was very wonderful, and Gertrude felt
herself most suggestively corrected. It was strange, nevertheless, that
Felix should speak in that positive way about his (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) sister's beauty. <div class="bookquote">``I
think I _shall_ think her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) handsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude said. <div class="bookquote">``It must be very
interesting to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>). I don't feel as if I ever could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you will know her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) well; you will become great friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix
declared, as if this were the easiest thing in the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) is very graceful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, looking after the Baroness,
suspended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) father's arm. It was a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) to say that
anyone was graceful.

<p/>Felix had been looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And your little cousin, of
yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``who was so wonderfully pretty--what has become of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) is in the parlor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude answered. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) is very pretty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) felt as if it were her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) duty to take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) straight into the house,
to where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might be near her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) cousin. But after hesitating a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
lingered still. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't believe you would come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not come back!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't know, then, the
impression made upon this susceptible heart of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant the impression her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) cousin Lizzie had made.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't think we should ever see you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray what did you think would become of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I thought you would melt away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a compliment to my solidity! I melt very often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix,
<div class="bookquote">``but there is always something left of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I came and waited for you by the door, because the others did,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude went on. <div class="bookquote">``But if you had never appeared I should not have been
surprised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>declared Felix, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that you would have been
disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a little, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No--no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Ah, par exemple!'' (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>_ cried the young man. <div class="bookquote">``You deserve that I should
never leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Going into the parlor they found Mr. Wentworth performing introductions.
A young man was standing before the Baroness, blushing a good deal,
laughing a little, and shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) weight from one foot to the other--a
slim, mild-faced young man, with neatly-arranged features, like those
of Mr. Wentworth. Two other gentlemen, behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), had risen from their
seats, and a little apart, near one of the windows, stood a remarkably
pretty young girl. The young girl was knitting a stocking; but, while
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers quickly moved, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked with wide, brilliant eyes at the
Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is your son's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia, smiling at the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Clifford Wentworth, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a tremulous voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you come out to meet me, Mr. Clifford Wentworth?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>the
Baroness demanded, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) beautiful smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't think you would want me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, slowly sidling
about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One always wants a _beau cousin_,--if one has one! But if you are
very nice to me in future I won't remember it against you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>And Madame
Münster transferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) smile to the other persons present. It rested
first upon the candid countenance and long-skirted figure of Mr. Brand,
whose eyes were intently fixed upon Mr. Wentworth, as if to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) not
to prolong an anomalous situation. Mr. Wentworth pronounced his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) name.
Eugenia gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) a very charming glance, and then looked at the other
gentleman.

<p/>This latter personage was a man of rather less than the usual stature
and the usual weight, with a quick, observant, agreeable dark eye, a
small quantity of thin dark hair, and a small moustache. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been
standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets; and when Eugenia looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took them out. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not, like Mr. Brand, look evasively and
urgently at their host. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) met Eugenia's eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) appeared to appreciate
the privilege of meeting them. Madame Münster instantly felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
was, intrinsically, the most important person present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) was not
unconscious that this impression was in some degree manifested in the
little sympathetic nod with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) acknowledged Mr. Wentworth's
announcement, <div class="bookquote">``My cousin, Mr. Acton!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your cousin--not mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It only depends upon you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Acton/Acton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Acton declared, laughing.

<p/>The Baroness looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) a moment, and noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had very white
teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Let it depend upon your behavior,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I think I
had better wait. I have cousins enough. Unless I can also claim
relationship,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``with that charming young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
pointed to the young girl at the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Acton/Acton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Acton. And Gertrude Wentworth put her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) arm
round the young girl and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) forward. It was not, apparently, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) needed much leading. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) came toward the Baroness with a light,
quick step, and with perfect self-possession, rolling her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) stocking
round its needles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had dark blue eyes and dark brown hair; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was
wonderfully pretty.

<p/>Eugenia kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had kissed the other young women, and then
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) off a little, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now this is quite another
_type_,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) pronounced the word in the French manner. <div class="bookquote">``This
is a different outline, my uncle, a different character, from that of
your own daughters. This, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``is very much more what
we have always thought of as the American type.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The young girl, during this exposition, was smiling askance at everyone
in turn, and at Felix out of turn. <div class="bookquote">``I find only one type here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried
Felix, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``The type adorable!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>This sally was received in perfect silence, but Felix, who learned
all things quickly, had already learned that the silences frequently
observed among his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) new acquaintances were not necessarily restrictive
or resentful. It was, as one might say, the silence of expectation,
of modesty. They were all standing round his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sister, as if they were
expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to acquit herself of the exhibition of some peculiar
faculty, some brilliant talent. Their attitude seemed to imply that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
was a kind of conversational mountebank, attired, intellectually, in
gauze and spangles. This attitude gave a certain ironical force to
Madame Münster's next words. <div class="bookquote">``Now this is your circle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
uncle. <div class="bookquote">``This is your _salon_. These are your regular _habitués_, eh? I
am so glad to see you all together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, <div class="bookquote">``they are always dropping in and out. You must
do the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte/Charlotte Wentworth</b></font>)</div>interposed Charlotte Wentworth, <div class="bookquote">``they must do something more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte/Charlotte Wentworth</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sweet, serious face, that seemed at once timid and
placid, upon their interesting visitor. <div class="bookquote">``What is your name?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eugenia-Camilla-Dolores,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``But you needn't
say all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will say Eugenia, if you will let me. You must come and stay with
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Baroness</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) hand upon Charlotte's arm very tenderly; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
reserved herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was wondering whether it would be possible to
<div class="bookquote">``stay''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>with these people. <div class="bookquote">``It would be very charming--very charming,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) eyes wandered over the company, over the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
wished to gain time before committing herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) glance fell upon
young Mr. Brand, who stood there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) arms folded and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hand
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) chin, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The gentleman, I suppose, is a sort of
ecclesiastic,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said to Mr. Wentworth, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) voice a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a minister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A Protestant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>asked Eugenia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a Unitarian, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brand, impressively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia. <div class="bookquote">``Something new.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had never heard of this
form of worship.

<p/>Mr. Acton began to laugh, and Gertrude looked anxiously at Mr. Brand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have come very far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very far--very far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness replied, with a graceful shake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
head--a shake that might have meant many different things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a reason why you ought to settle down with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Wentworth, with that dryness of utterance which, as Eugenia was too
intelligent not to feel, took nothing from the delicacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) meaning.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), and for an instant, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) cold, still face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
seemed to see a far-away likeness to the vaguely remembered image of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
mother. Eugenia was a woman of sudden emotions, and now, unexpectedly,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) felt one rising in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) kept looking round the circle; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
knew that there was admiration in all the eyes that were fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) smiled at them all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to look--to try--to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me I have done
well. I am very tired; I want to rest.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There were tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) eyes.
The luminous interior, the gentle, tranquil people, the simple, serious
life--the sense of these things pressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) with an overmastering
force, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) felt herself yielding to one of the most genuine emotions
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had ever known. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to stay here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Pray take
me in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) was smiling, there were tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) voice as well as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``My dear niece,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, softly. And Charlotte put
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arms and drew the Baroness toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); while Robert Acton turned
away, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hands stealing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) pockets.



<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>A few days after the Baroness Münster had presented herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>)
American kinsfolk she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) came, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) brother, and took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) abode in
that small white house adjacent to Mr. Wentworth's own dwelling of which
mention has already been made. It was on going with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughters to
return her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) visit that Mr. Wentworth placed this comfortable cottage at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) service; the offer being the result of a domestic colloquy, diffused
through the ensuing twenty-four hours, in the course of which the
two foreign visitors were discussed and analyzed with a great deal of
earnestness and subtlety. The discussion went forward, as I say, in the
family circle; but that circle on the evening following Madame Münster's
return to town, as on many other occasions, included Robert Acton and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) pretty sister. If you had been present, it would probably not have
seemed to you that the advent of these brilliant strangers was treated
as an exhilarating occurrence, a pleasure the more in this tranquil
household, a prospective source of entertainment. This was not Mr.
Wentworth's way of treating any human occurrence. The sudden irruption
into the well-ordered consciousness of the Wentworths of an element not
allowed for in its scheme of usual obligations required a readjustment
of that sense of responsibility which constituted its principal
furniture. To consider an event, crudely and baldly, in the light of
the pleasure it might bring them was an intellectual exercise with which
Felix Young's American cousins were almost wholly unacquainted, and
which they scarcely supposed to be largely pursued in any section of
human society. The arrival of Felix and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sister was a satisfaction,
but it was a singularly joyless and inelastic satisfaction. It was an
extension of duty, of the exercise of the more recondite virtues; but
neither Mr. Wentworth, nor Charlotte, nor Mr. Brand, who, among these
excellent people, was a great promoter of reflection and aspiration,
frankly adverted to it as an extension of enjoyment. This function was
ultimately assumed by Gertrude Wentworth, who was a peculiar girl, but
the full compass of whose peculiarities had not been exhibited before
they very ingeniously found their pretext in the presence of these
possibly too agreeable foreigners. Gertrude, however, had to struggle
with a great accumulation of obstructions, both of the subjective, as
the metaphysicians say, and of the objective, order; and indeed it is
no small part of the purpose of this little history to set forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
struggle. What seemed paramount in this abrupt enlargement of Mr.
Wentworth's sympathies and those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughters was an extension of
the field of possible mistakes; and the doctrine, as it may almost
be called, of the oppressive gravity of mistakes was one of the most
cherished traditions of the Wentworth family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wants to come and stay in this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said
Gertrude; Madame Münster, from this time forward, receiving no other
designation than the personal pronoun. Charlotte and Gertrude acquired
considerable facility in addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), directly, as <div class="bookquote">``Eugenia;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>but in
speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to each other they rarely called her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) anything but <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) think it good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>cried little Lizzie
Acton, who was always asking unpractical questions that required, in
strictness, no answer, and to which indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) expected no other
answer than such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) herself invariably furnished in a small,
innocently-satirical laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) certainly expressed a willingness to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was only politeness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude rejoined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) is very polite--very polite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) is too polite,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) son declared, in a softly growling tone which
was habitual to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), but which was an indication of nothing worse than a
vaguely humorous intention. <div class="bookquote">``It is very embarrassing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is more than can be said of you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Lizzie Acton, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't mean to encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't care if you do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>cried Lizzie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) will not think of you, Clifford,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) will think of Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude continued, in the same tone.

<p/>Robert Acton began to blush; but there was no occasion for it, for
everyone was looking at Gertrude--everyone, at least, save Lizzie, who,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) pretty head on one side, contemplated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you attribute motives, Gertrude?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't attribute motives, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``I only say she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will
think of Robert; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gertrude judges by herself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Acton/Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton exclaimed, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you,
Gertrude? Of course the Baroness will think of me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will think of me
from morning till night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will be very comfortable here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, with something of
a housewife's pride. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) can have the large northeast room. And the
French bedstead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte added, with a constant sense of the lady's
foreignness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will not like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude; <div class="bookquote">``not even if you pin little
tidies all over the chairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>asked Charlotte, perceiving a touch of irony here, but
not resenting it.

<p/>Gertrude had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) chair; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was walking about the room; her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) stiff
silk dress, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had put on in honor of the Baroness, made a sound
upon the carpet. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will want something
more--more private.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wants to be private she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) can stay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Lizzie Acton
remarked.

<p/>Gertrude paused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) walk, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That would not be
pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wants privacy and pleasure together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert Acton/Robert</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Acton began to laugh again. <div class="bookquote">``My dear cousin, what a picture!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte had fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) serious eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wondered
whence she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had suddenly derived these strange notions. Mr. Wentworth
also observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) younger daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) manner of life may have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
certainly never can have enjoyed a more refined and salubrious home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude stood there looking at them all. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) is the wife of a Prince,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all princes here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth; <div class="bookquote">``and I don't know of any
palace in this neighborhood that is to let.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousin William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert Acton/Robert</b></font>)</div>Robert Acton interposed, <div class="bookquote">``do you want to do something
handsome? Make them a present, for three months, of the little house
over the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert Acton/Robert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very generous with other people's things!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert is very generous with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth observed
dispassionately, and looking, in cold meditation, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) kinsman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Lizzie went on, <div class="bookquote">``I had an idea you were so fond of your new
cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which new cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean the Baroness!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl rejoined, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I
thought you expected to see so much of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Felix? I hope to see a great deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you want to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) out of the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked at Lizzie Acton, and then looked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you want me to live in the house with you, Lizzie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked
Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you never will. I hate you!''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>Such was this young lady's reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, stopping before Mr. Wentworth and smiling, with
a smile the sweeter, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) smile always was, for its rarity; <div class="bookquote">``do let
them live in the little house over the way. It will be lovely!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Acton had been watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Gertrude is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Gertrude is the cleverest girl in the world. If I might take the
liberty, I should strongly recommend their living there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing there so pretty as the northeast room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte
urged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will make it pretty. Leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton exclaimed.

<p/>Gertrude, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) compliment, had blushed and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>): it was as if
someone less familiar had complimented her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will make
it pretty. It will be very interesting. It will be a place to go to. It
will be a foreign house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we very sure that we need a foreign house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth inquired.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you think it desirable to establish a foreign house--in this quiet
place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``as if it were a question of the poor
Baroness opening a wine-shop or a gaming-table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be too lovely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude declared again, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) hand on
the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father's chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) should open a gaming-table?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte asked, with great
gravity.

<p/>Gertrude looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) a moment, and then, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said,
simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gertrude is growing pert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford Wentworth observed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
humorous young growl. <div class="bookquote">``That comes of associating with foreigners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth looked up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughter, who was standing beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
drew her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) gently forward. <div class="bookquote">``You must be careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You must keep
watch. Indeed, we must all be careful. This is a great change; we are
to be exposed to peculiar influences. I don't say they are bad. I don't
judge them in advance. But they may perhaps make it necessary that we
should exercise a great deal of wisdom and self-control. It will be a
different tone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude was silent a moment, in deference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father's speech; then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) spoke in a manner that was not in the least an answer to it. <div class="bookquote">``I want
to see how they will live. I am sure they will have different hours. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
will do all kinds of little things differently. When we go over there it
will be like going to Europe. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) will have a boudoir. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) will invite
us to dinner--very late. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) will breakfast in her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte/Charlotte Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister again. Gertrude's imagination seemed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) to be fairly running riot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had always known that Gertrude had
a great deal of imagination--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had been very proud of it. But at the
same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had always felt that it was a dangerous and irresponsible
faculty; and now, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sense, for the moment, it seemed to threaten to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister a strange person who should come in suddenly, as from a
journey, talking of the peculiar and possibly unpleasant things she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had
observed. Charlotte's imagination took no journeys whatever; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
kept it, as it were, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pocket, with the other furniture of this
receptacle--a thimble, a little box of peppermint, and a morsel of
court-plaster. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) would have any dinner--or any
breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Miss Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) knows how to do
anything herself. I should have to get her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) ever so many servants, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) wouldn't like them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) has a maid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude; <div class="bookquote">``a French maid. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if the maid has a little fluted cap and red slippers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said
Lizzie Acton. <div class="bookquote">``There was a French maid in that play that Robert took me
to see. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had pink stockings; she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was very wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was a _soubrette_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude announced, who had never seen a play
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">``They call that a soubrette. It will be a great chance to
learn French.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte gave a little soft, helpless groan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had a
vision of a wicked, theatrical person, clad in pink stockings and red
shoes, and speaking, with confounding volubility, an incomprehensible
tongue, flitting through the sacred penetralia of that large, clean
house. <div class="bookquote">``That is one reason in favor of their coming here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude went
on. <div class="bookquote">``But we can make Eugenia speak French to us, and Felix. I mean to
begin--the next time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) standing near him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
earnest, thin, unresponsive glance again. <div class="bookquote">``I want you to make me a
promise, Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to get excited. Not to allow these--these occurrences to be an
occasion for excitement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) a moment, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
think I can promise that, father. I am excited already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth was silent a while; they all were silent, as if in
recognition of something audacious and portentous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they had better go to the other house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte,
quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall keep them in the other house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth subjoined, more
pregnantly.

<p/>Gertrude turned away; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked across at Robert Acton. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) cousin
Robert was a great friend of hers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) often looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) this way
instead of saying things. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) glance on this occasion, however, struck
him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) as a substitute for a larger volume of diffident utterance than
usual, inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to observe, among other things, the inefficiency of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father's design--if design it was--for diminishing, in the
interest of quiet nerves, their occasions of contact with their foreign
relatives. But Acton immediately complimented Mr. Wentworth upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
liberality. <div class="bookquote">``That's a very nice thing to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``giving them
the little house. You will have treated them handsomely, and, whatever
happens, you will be glad of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth was liberal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knew
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was liberal. It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) pleasure to know it, to feel it, to see it
recorded; and this pleasure is the only palpable form of self-indulgence
with which the narrator of these incidents will be able to charge him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A three days' visit at most, over there, is all I should have found
possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Münster</b></font>)</div>Madame Münster remarked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) brother, after they had
taken possession of the little white house. <div class="bookquote">``It would have been too
_intime_--decidedly too _intime_. Breakfast, dinner, and tea _en
famille_--it would have been the end of the world if I could have
reached the third day.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) made the same observation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) maid
Augustine, an intelligent person, who enjoyed a liberal share of her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
confidence. Felix declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would willingly spend his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life in
the bosom of the Wentworth family; that they were the kindest, simplest,
most amiable people in the world, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had taken a prodigious
fancy to them all. The Baroness quite agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that they were
simple and kind; they were thoroughly nice people, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) liked them
extremely. The girls were perfect ladies; it was impossible to be more
of a lady than Charlotte Wentworth, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) little village
air. <div class="bookquote">``But as for thinking them the best company in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the
Baroness, <div class="bookquote">``that is another thing; and as for wishing to live _porte à
porte_ with them, I should as soon think of wishing myself back in the
convent again, to wear a bombazine apron and sleep in a dormitory.''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>And
yet the Baroness was in high good humor; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had been very much pleased.
With her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) lively perception and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) refined imagination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was capable
of enjoying anything that was characteristic, anything that was good
of its kind. The Wentworth household seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) very perfect in
its kind--wonderfully peaceful and unspotted; pervaded by a sort of
dove-colored freshness that had all the quietude and benevolence of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) deemed to be Quakerism, and yet seemed to be founded upon a degree
of material abundance for which, in certain matters of detail, one
might have looked in vain at the frugal little court of
Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) perceived immediately that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) American
relatives thought and talked very little about money; and this of itself
made an impression upon Eugenia's imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) perceived at the same
time that if Charlotte or Gertrude should ask their father for a very
considerable sum he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would at once place it in their hands; and this made
a still greater impression. The greatest impression of all, perhaps,
was made by another rapid induction. The Baroness had an immediate
conviction that Robert Acton would put his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) pocket every
day in the week if that rattle-pated little sister of his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) should bid
him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>). The men in this country, said the Baroness, are evidently very
obliging. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) declaration that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was looking for rest and retirement
had been by no means wholly untrue; nothing that the Baroness said was
wholly untrue. It is but fair to add, perhaps, that nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
said was wholly true. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) wrote to a friend in Germany that it was a
return to nature; it was like drinking new milk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was very fond
of new milk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said to herself, of course, that it would be a little
dull; but there can be no better proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) good spirits than the fact
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) should not mind its being a little dull. It seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), when from the piazza of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) eleemosynary cottage she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) looked out
over the soundless fields, the stony pastures, the clear-faced ponds,
the rugged little orchards, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had never been in the midst of
so peculiarly intense a stillness; it was almost a delicate sensual
pleasure. It was all very good, very innocent and safe, and out of it
something good must come. Augustine, indeed, who had an unbounded faith
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) mistress's wisdom and far-sightedness, was a great deal perplexed
and depressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) was always ready to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) cue when she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) understood
it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) liked to understand it, and on this occasion comprehension
failed. What, indeed, was the Baroness doing _dans cette galère_? what
fish did she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) expect to land out of these very stagnant waters? The game
was evidently a deep one. Augustine could trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>); but the sense of
walking in the dark betrayed itself in the physiognomy of this spare,
sober, sallow, middle-aged person, who had nothing in common with
Gertrude Wentworth's conception of a soubrette, by the most ironical
scowl that had ever rested upon the unpretending tokens of the peace and
plenty of the Wentworths. Fortunately, Augustine could quench skepticism
in action. She (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) quite agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) mistress--or rather she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) quite
out-stripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) mistress--in thinking that the little white house was
pitifully bare. _<div class="bookquote">``Il faudra,'' (<font color='red'><b>Augustine</b></font>)</div>_ said Augustine, _<div class="bookquote">``lui faire un peu de
toilette.'' (<font color='red'><b>Augustine</b></font>)</div>_ And she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) began to hang up _portières_ in the doorways;
to place wax candles, procured after some research, in unexpected
situations; to dispose anomalous draperies over the arms of sofas and
the backs of chairs. The Baroness had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) to the New
World a copious provision of the element of costume; and the two Miss
Wentworths, when they came over to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), were somewhat bewildered
by the obtrusive distribution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) wardrobe. There were India shawls
suspended, curtain-wise, in the parlor door, and curious fabrics,
corresponding to Gertrude's metaphysical vision of an opera-cloak,
tumbled about in the sitting-places. There were pink silk blinds in
the windows, by which the room was strangely bedimmed; and along the
chimney-piece was disposed a remarkable band of velvet, covered
with coarse, dirty-looking lace. <div class="bookquote">``I have been making myself a little
comfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, much to the confusion of Charlotte,
who had been on the point of proposing to come and help her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
superfluous draperies away. But what Charlotte mistook for an almost
culpably delayed subsidence Gertrude very presently perceived to be the
most ingenious, the most interesting, the most romantic intention. <div class="bookquote">``What
is life, indeed, without curtains?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) secretly asked herself; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) appeared to herself to have been leading hitherto an existence
singularly garish and totally devoid of festoons.

<p/>Felix was not a young man who troubled himself greatly about
anything--least of all about the conditions of enjoyment. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faculty of
enjoyment was so large, so unconsciously eager, that it may be said of
it that it had a permanent advance upon embarrassment and sorrow. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sentient faculty was intrinsically joyous, and novelty and change were
in themselves a delight to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). As they had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a great
deal of frequency, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life had been more agreeable than appeared.
Never was a nature more perfectly fortunate. It was not a restless,
apprehensive, ambitious spirit, running a race with the tyranny of fate,
but a temper so unsuspicious as to put Adversity off her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) guard, dodging
and evading her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with the easy, natural motion of a wind-shifted
flower. Felix extracted entertainment from all things, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
faculties--his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) imagination, his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) intelligence, his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) affections, his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
senses--had a hand in the game. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) that Eugenia and he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had
been very well treated; there was something absolutely touching in that
combination of paternal liberality and social considerateness which
marked Mr. Wentworth's deportment. It was most uncommonly kind of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>),
for instance, to have given them a house. Felix was positively amused at
having a house of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own; for the little white cottage among the apple
trees--the chalet, as Madame Münster always called it--was much more
sensibly his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own than any domiciliary _quatrième_, looking upon a
court, with the rent overdue. Felix had spent a good deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) life
in looking into courts, with a perhaps slightly tattered pair of elbows
resting upon the ledge of a high-perched window, and the thin smoke of a
cigarette rising into an atmosphere in which street-cries died away and
the vibration of chimes from ancient belfries became sensible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
never known anything so infinitely rural as these New England fields;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) took a great fancy to all their pastoral roughnesses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
never had a greater sense of luxurious security; and at the risk of
making him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) seem a rather sordid adventurer I must declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) found
an irresistible charm in the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might dine every day at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
uncle's. The charm was irresistible, however, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) fancy flung
a rosy light over this homely privilege. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) appreciated highly the fare
that was set before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>). There was a kind of fresh-looking abundance
about it which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) think that people must have lived so in
the mythological era, when they spread their tables upon the grass,
replenished them from cornucopias, and had no particular need of kitchen
stoves. But the great thing that Felix enjoyed was having found a
family--sitting in the midst of gentle, generous people whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might
call by their first names. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had never known anything more charming
than the attention they paid to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said. It was like a large sheet
of clean, fine-grained drawing-paper, all ready to be washed over with
effective splashes of water-color. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had never had any cousins, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had never before found himself in contact so unrestricted with young
unmarried ladies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was extremely fond of the society of ladies, and it
was new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) that it might be enjoyed in just this manner. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
hardly knew what to make of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) state of mind. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was in love, indiscriminately, with three girls at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) saw that
Lizzie Acton was more brilliantly pretty than Charlotte and Gertrude;
but this was scarcely a superiority. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) pleasure came from something
they had in common--a part of which was, indeed, that physical delicacy
which seemed to make it proper that they should always dress in thin
materials and clear colors. But they were delicate in other ways, and
it was most agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) to feel that these latter delicacies were
appreciable by contact, as it were. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had known, fortunately, many
virtuous gentlewomen, but it now appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) relations
with them -LRB-especially when they were unmarried-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had been looking at
pictures under glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) perceived at present what a nuisance the glass
had been--how it perverted and interfered, how it caught the reflection
of other objects and kept you walking from side to side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had no need
to ask himself whether Charlotte and Gertrude, and Lizzie Acton, were
in the right light; they were always in the right light. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) liked
everything about them: he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was, for instance, not at all above liking the
fact that they had very slender feet and high insteps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) liked their
pretty noses; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) liked their surprised eyes and their hesitating, not
at all positive way of speaking; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) liked so much knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was
perfectly at liberty to be alone for hours, anywhere, with either of
them; that preference for one to the other, as a companion of solitude,
remained a minor affair. Charlotte Wentworth's sweetly severe features
were as agreeable as Lizzie Acton's wonderfully expressive blue eyes;
and Gertrude's air of being always ready to walk about and listen was
as charming as anything else, especially as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) walked very gracefully.
After a while Felix began to distinguish; but even then he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would often
wish, suddenly, that they were not all so sad. Even Lizzie Acton,
in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) fine little chatter and laughter, appeared sad. Even
Clifford Wentworth, who had extreme youth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) favor, and kept a buggy
with enormous wheels and a little sorrel mare with the prettiest legs
in the world--even this fortunate lad was apt to have an averted,
uncomfortable glance, and to edge away from you at times, in the manner
of a person with a bad conscience. The only person in the circle with
no sense of oppression of any kind was, to Felix's perception, Robert
Acton.

<p/>It might perhaps have been feared that after the completion of those
graceful domiciliary embellishments which have been mentioned Madame
Münster would have found herself confronted with alarming possibilities
of _ennui_. But as yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had not taken the alarm. The Baroness was a
restless soul, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) projected her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) restlessness, as it may be said,
into any situation that lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>). Up to a certain point her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
restlessness might be counted upon to entertain her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was always
expecting something to happen, and, until it was disappointed,
expectancy itself was a delicate pleasure. What the Baroness expected
just now it would take some ingenuity to set forth; it is enough
that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) found something to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) assured herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was enchanted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) new
relatives; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) professed to herself that, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) felt
it a sacred satisfaction to have found a family. It is certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
enjoyed to the utmost the gentleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) kinsfolk's deference.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had, first and last, received a great deal of admiration, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
experience of well-turned compliments was very considerable; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had never been so real a power, never counted for so
much, as now when, for the first time, the standard of comparison of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
little circle was a prey to vagueness. The sense, indeed, that the good
people about her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had, as regards her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) remarkable self, no standard of
comparison at all gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) a feeling of almost illimitable power. It was
true, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said to herself, that if for this reason they would be
able to discover nothing against her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), so they would perhaps neglect
to perceive some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) superior points; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) always wound up her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
reflections by declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) would take care of that.

<p/>Charlotte and Gertrude were in some perplexity between their desire
to show all proper attention to Madame Münster and their fear of being
importunate. The little house in the orchard had hitherto been occupied
during the summer months by intimate friends of the family, or by poor
relations who found in Mr. Wentworth a landlord attentive to repairs and
oblivious of quarter-day. Under these circumstances the open door of the
small house and that of the large one, facing each other across their
homely gardens, levied no tax upon hourly visits. But the Misses
Wentworth received an impression that Eugenia was no friend to the
primitive custom of <div class="bookquote">``dropping in;''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia no friend</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) evidently had no idea of living
without a door-keeper. <div class="bookquote">``One goes into your house as into an inn--except
that there are no servants rushing forward,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said to Charlotte. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) added that that was very charming. Gertrude explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) meant just the reverse; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) didn't like it at all. Charlotte
inquired why she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should tell an untruth, and Gertrude answered that
there was probably some very good reason for it which they should
discover when they knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) better. <div class="bookquote">``There can surely be no good reason
for telling an untruth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) does not think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>They had of course desired, from the first, to do everything in the way
of helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to arrange herself. It had seemed to Charlotte that
there would be a great many things to talk about; but the Baroness was
apparently inclined to talk about nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Write her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) a note, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) leave to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>). I think that is
what she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) will like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I give her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) the trouble of answering me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte asked.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) will have to write a note and send it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) will take any trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, profoundly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What then will she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I am curious to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister
with an impression that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) curiosity was morbid.

<p/>They went to see the Baroness without preliminary correspondence; and in
the little salon which she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had already created, with its becoming light
and its festoons, they found Robert Acton.

<p/>Eugenia was intensely gracious, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) accused them of neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
cruelly. <div class="bookquote">``You see Mr. Acton has had to take pity upon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My
brother goes off sketching, for hours; I can never depend upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). So I
was to send Mr. Acton to beg you to come and give me the benefit of your
wisdom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wanted to say, <div class="bookquote">``_That_ is what she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>)
would have done.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Charlotte said that they hoped the Baroness would
always come and dine with them; it would give them so much pleasure;
and, in that case, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) would spare herself the trouble of having a cook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I must have a cook!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>cried the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``An old negress in a
yellow turban. I have set my heart upon that. I want to look out of my
window and see her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) sitting there on the grass, against the background of
those crooked, dusky little apple trees, pulling the husks off a lapful
of Indian corn. That will be local color, you know. There isn't much of
it here--you don't mind my saying that, do you?--so one must make
the most of what one can get. I shall be most happy to dine with you
whenever you will let me; but I want to be able to ask you sometimes.
And I want to be able to ask Mr. Acton,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>added the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must come and ask me at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton. <div class="bookquote">``You must come and see
me; you must dine with me first. I want to show you my place; I want to
introduce you to my mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) called again upon Madame Münster, two
days later. He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) was constantly at the other house; he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) used to walk across
the fields from his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) own place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) appeared to have fewer scruples
than his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) cousins with regard to dropping in. On this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) found
that Mr. Brand had come to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) respects to the charming stranger;
but after Acton's arrival the young theologian said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>theologian</b></font>) sat in
his (<font color='blue'><b>theologian</b></font>) chair with his (<font color='blue'><b>theologian</b></font>) two hands clasped, fixing upon his (<font color='blue'><b>theologian</b></font>) hostess a grave,
fascinated stare. The Baroness talked to Robert Acton, but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
talked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) turned and smiled at Mr. Brand, who never took his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) eyes
off her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>). The two men walked away together; they were going to Mr.
Wentworth's. Mr. Brand still said nothing; but after they had passed
into Mr. Wentworth's garden he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) stopped and looked back for some time at
the little white house. Then, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) companion, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) head
bent a little to one side and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) eyes somewhat contracted, <div class="bookquote">``Now
I suppose that's what is called conversation,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``real
conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's what I call a very clever woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is most interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand continued. <div class="bookquote">``I only wish she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
speak French; it would seem more in keeping. It must be quite the
style that we have heard about, that we have read about--the style of
conversation of Madame de Staël, of Madame Récamier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton also looked at Madame Münster's residence among its hollyhocks and
apple trees. <div class="bookquote">``What I should like to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``is just
what has brought Madame Récamier to live in that place!''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>Mr. Wentworth, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) cane and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) gloves in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hand, went every
afternoon to call upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) niece. A couple of hours later she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) came over
to the great house to tea. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had let the proposal that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) should
regularly dine there fall to the ground; she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was in the enjoyment of
whatever satisfaction was to be derived from the spectacle of an
old negress in a crimson turban shelling peas under the apple trees.
Charlotte, who had provided the ancient negress, thought it must be
a strange household, Eugenia having told her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) that Augustine managed
everything, the ancient negress included--Augustine who was naturally
devoid of all acquaintance with the expurgatory English tongue. By far
the most immoral sentiment which I shall have occasion to attribute to
Charlotte Wentworth was a certain emotion of disappointment at finding
that, in spite of these irregular conditions, the domestic arrangements
at the small house were apparently not--from Eugenia's peculiar point of
view--strikingly offensive. The Baroness found it amusing to go to tea;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) dressed as if for dinner. The tea-table offered an anomalous and
picturesque repast; and on leaving it they all sat and talked in the
large piazza, or wandered about the garden in the starlight, with their
ears full of those sounds of strange insects which, though they are
supposed to be, all over the world, a part of the magic of summer
nights, seemed to the Baroness to have beneath these western skies an
incomparable resonance.

<p/>Mr. Wentworth, though, as I say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) went punctiliously to call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>),
was not able to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was getting used to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) niece. It taxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
imagination to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was really his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) half-sister's child. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
sister was a figure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) early years; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been only twenty when
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went abroad, never to return, making in foreign parts a willful and
undesirable marriage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) aunt, Mrs. Whiteside, who had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Whiteside</b></font>) to
Europe for the benefit of the tour, gave, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Whiteside</b></font>) return, so lamentable
an account of Mr. Adolphus Young, to whom the headstrong girl had united
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) destiny, that it operated as a chill upon family feeling--especially
in the case of the half-brothers. Catherine had done nothing
subsequently to propitiate her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) family; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not even written to
them in a way that indicated a lucid appreciation of their suspended
sympathy; so that it had become a tradition in Boston circles that the
highest charity, as regards this young lady, was to think it well to
forget her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and to abstain from conjecture as to the extent to which
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aberrations were reproduced in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) descendants. Over these young
people--a vague report of their existence had come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ears--Mr.
Wentworth had not, in the course of years, allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) imagination to
hover. It had plenty of occupation nearer home, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had many
cares upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) conscience the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had been an unnatural uncle
was, very properly, never among the number. Now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) nephew and
niece had come before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) perceived that they were the fruit of
influences and circumstances very different from those under which his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
own familiar progeny had reached a vaguely-qualified maturity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) felt
no provocation to say that these influences had been exerted for evil;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was sometimes afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should not be able to like
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) distinguished, delicate, lady-like niece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was paralyzed and
bewildered by her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) foreignness. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) spoke, somehow, a different language.
There was something strange in her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had a feeling that another
man, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) place, would accommodate himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) tone; would ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) questions and joke with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), reply to those pleasantries of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
own which sometimes seemed startling as addressed to an uncle. But Mr.
Wentworth could not do these things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not even bring himself
to attempt to measure her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) position in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was the wife of
a foreign nobleman who desired to repudiate her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>). This had a singular
sound, but the old man felt himself destitute of the materials for
a judgment. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to find them in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
experience, as a man of the world and an almost public character; but
they were not there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was ashamed to confess to himself--much
more to reveal to Eugenia by interrogations possibly too innocent--the
unfurnished condition of this repository.

<p/>It appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could get much nearer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would have said,
to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) nephew; though he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was not sure that Felix was altogether safe. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
was so bright and handsome and talkative that it was impossible not to
think well of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>); and yet it seemed as if there were something almost
impudent, almost vicious--or as if there ought to be--in a young man
being at once so joyous and so positive. It was to be observed that
while Felix was not at all a serious young man there was somehow more of
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had more weight and volume and resonance--than a number of young
men who were distinctly serious. While Mr. Wentworth meditated upon this
anomaly his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) nephew was admiring him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) unrestrictedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) a
most delicate, generous, high-toned old gentleman, with a very handsome
head, of the ascetic type, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) promised himself the profit of
sketching. Felix was far from having made a secret of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
wielded the paint-brush, and it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own fault if it failed to be
generally understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was prepared to execute the most striking
likenesses on the most reasonable terms. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) is an artist--my cousin is
an artist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) offered this information to everyone
who would receive it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) offered it to herself, as it were, by way
of admonition and reminder; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) repeated to herself at odd moments,
in lonely places, that Felix was invested with this sacred character.
Gertrude had never seen an artist before; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had only read about such
people. They seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) a romantic and mysterious class, whose life
was made up of those agreeable accidents that never happened to other
persons. And it merely quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) meditations on this point that
Felix should declare, as he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) repeatedly did, that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was really not an
artist. <div class="bookquote">``I have never gone into the thing seriously,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have
never studied; I have had no training. I do a little of everything, and
nothing well. I am only an amateur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>It pleased Gertrude even more to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was an amateur than to
think that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was an artist; the former word, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) fancy, had an even
subtler connotation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) knew, however, that it was a word to use
more soberly. Mr. Wentworth used it freely; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had not
been exactly familiar with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) found it convenient as a help toward
classifying Felix, who, as a young man extremely clever and active and
apparently respectable and yet not engaged in any recognized business,
was an importunate anomaly. Of course the Baroness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother--she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
was always spoken of first--were a welcome topic of conversation between
Mr. Wentworth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughters and their occasional visitors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the young man, your nephew, what is his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) profession?''  (<font color='red'><b>an gentleman Broderip</b></font>)</div>asked an
old gentleman--Mr. Broderip, of Salem--who had been Mr. Wentworth's
classmate at Harvard College in the year 1809, and who came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
office in Devonshire Street. -LRB-Mr. Wentworth, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) later years, used to
go but three times a week to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) office, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had a large amount of
highly confidential trust-business to transact.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)'s an amateur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix's uncle, with folded hands, and with
a certain satisfaction in being able to say it. And Mr. Broderip had
gone back to Salem with a feeling that this was probably a <div class="bookquote">``European''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broderip</b></font>)</div>expression for a broker or a grain exporter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to do your head, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix to his (<font color='blue'><b>Broderip</b></font>) uncle one
evening, before them all--Mr. Brand and Robert Acton being also present.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I should make a very fine thing of it. It's an interesting
head; it's very mediaeval.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth looked grave; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) felt awkwardly, as if all the company had
come in and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) standing before the looking-glass. <div class="bookquote">``The Lord made
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it is for man to make it over again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly the Lord made it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>replied Felix, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) made
it very well. But life has been touching up the work. It is a very
interesting type of head. It's delightfully wasted and emaciated. The
complexion is wonderfully bleached.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>And Felix looked round at the
circle, as if to call their attention to these interesting points.
Mr. Wentworth grew visibly paler. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to do you as an old
prelate, an old cardinal, or the prior of an order.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A prelate, a cardinal?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>murmured Mr. Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``Do you refer to the
Roman Catholic priesthood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean an old ecclesiastic who should have led a very pure, abstinent
life. Now I take it that has been the case with you, sir; one sees it in
your face,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix proceeded. <div class="bookquote">``You have been very--a very moderate. Don't
you think one always sees that in a man's face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see more in a man's face than I should think of looking for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Wentworth coldly.

<p/>The Baroness rattled her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) fan, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brilliant laugh. <div class="bookquote">``It is a
risk to look so close!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``My uncle has some peccadilloes
on his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) conscience.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), painfully at a loss;
and in so far as the signs of a pure and abstinent life were visible in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) face they were then probably peculiarly manifest. <div class="bookquote">``You are a _beau
vieillard_, dear uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Münster</b></font>)</div>said Madame Münster, smiling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) foreign
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are paying me a compliment,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, I am not the first woman that ever did so!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>cried the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth gravely. And turning to Felix he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
added, in the same tone, <div class="bookquote">``Please don't take my likeness. My children
have my daguerreotype. That is quite satisfactory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``not to work your head into something!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) and then at all the others; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) got up
and slowly walked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, in the silence that followed, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would
paint my portrait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte wondered whether Gertrude was right in wishing this; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
looked at Mr. Brand as the most legitimate way of ascertaining. Whatever
Gertrude did or said, Charlotte always looked at Mr. Brand. It was a
standing pretext for looking at Mr. Brand--always, as Charlotte thought,
in the interest of Gertrude's welfare. It is true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) felt a
tremulous interest in Gertrude being right; for Charlotte, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) small,
still way, was an heroic sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We should be glad to have your portrait, Miss Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be delighted to paint so charming a model,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think you are so lovely, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>asked Lizzie Acton, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
little inoffensive pertness, biting off a knot in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) knitting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not because I think I am beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, looking all
round. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I am beautiful, at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) spoke with a sort
of conscious deliberateness; and it seemed very strange to Charlotte to
hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) discussing this question so publicly. <div class="bookquote">``It is because I think it
would be amusing to sit and be painted. I have always thought that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you have not had better things to think about, my daughter,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very beautiful, cousin Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a compliment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``I put all the compliments I
receive into a little money-jug that has a slit in the side. I shake
them up and down, and they rattle. There are not many yet--only two or
three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's not a compliment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``See; I am careful not to
give it the form of a compliment. I didn't think you were beautiful at
first. But you have come to seem so little by little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, now, your jug doesn't burst!''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lizzie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think sitting for one's portrait is only one of the various forms of
idleness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``Their name is legion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix, <div class="bookquote">``you can't be said to be idle when you are
making a man work so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One might be painted while one is asleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Brand, as a
contribution to the discussion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, do paint me while I am asleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude to Felix, smiling.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) eyes a little. It had by this time become a matter of
almost exciting anxiety to Charlotte what Gertrude would say or would do
next.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) began to sit for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) portrait on the following day--in the open
air, on the north side of the piazza. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would tell me what you
think of us--how we seem to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said to Felix, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) sat before
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) easel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to me the best people in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude resumed, <div class="bookquote">``because it saves you the trouble of
saying anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) over the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) canvas. <div class="bookquote">``What else
should I say? It would certainly be a great deal of trouble to say
anything different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, <div class="bookquote">``you have seen people before that you have liked,
have you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I have, thank Heaven!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they have been very different from us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That only proves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``that there are a thousand different
ways of being good company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think us good company?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Company for a king!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude was silent a moment; and then, <div class="bookquote">``There must be a thousand
different ways of being dreary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and sometimes I think we
make use of them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix stood up quickly, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``If you could only keep
that look on your face for half an hour--while I catch it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It
is uncommonly handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To look handsome for half an hour--that is a great deal to ask of me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be the portrait of a young woman who has taken some vow, some
pledge, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) repents of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``and who is thinking it over
at leisure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have taken no vow, no pledge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, very gravely; <div class="bookquote">``I have
nothing to repent of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear cousin, that was only a figure of speech. I am very sure that
no one in your excellent family has anything to repent of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet we are always repenting!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``That is what I
mean by our being dreary. You know it perfectly well; you only pretend
that you don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix gave a quick laugh. <div class="bookquote">``The half hour is going on, and yet you are
handsomer than ever. One must be careful what one says, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, <div class="bookquote">``you can say anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), as an artist might, and painted for some time in
silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you seem to me different from your father and sister--from most of
the people you have lived with,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To say that one's self,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude went on, <div class="bookquote">``is like saying--by
implication, at least--that one is better. I am not better; I am much
worse. But they say themselves that I am different. It makes them
unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you accuse me of concealing my real impressions, I may admit that
I think the tendency--among you generally--is to be made unhappy too
easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would tell that to my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It might make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more unhappy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix exclaimed, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It certainly would. I don't believe you have seen people like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear cousin, how do you know what I have seen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``How can I tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might tell me a great many things, if you only would. You have
seen people like yourself--people who are bright and gay and fond of
amusement. We are not fond of amusement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``I confess that rather strikes me. You don't seem to
me to get all the pleasure out of life that you might. You don't seem to
me to enjoy... Do you mind my saying this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) asked, pausing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to me very well placed for enjoying. You have money and
liberty and what is called in Europe a `position.' But you take a
painful view of life, as one may say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One ought to think it bright and charming and delightful, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked
Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say so--if one can. It is true it all depends upon that,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know there is a great deal of misery in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) model.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen a little of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``But it was all
over there--beyond the sea. I don't see any here. This is a paradise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude said nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sat looking at the dahlias and the
currant-bushes in the garden, while Felix went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) work. ``To
`enjoy,''' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) began at last, <div class="bookquote">``to take life--not painfully, must one do
something wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix gave his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) long, light laugh again. <div class="bookquote">``Seriously, I think not. And for
this reason, among others: you strike me as very capable of enjoying,
if the chance were given you, and yet at the same time as incapable of
wrong-doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, <div class="bookquote">``that you are very wrong in telling a person
that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is incapable of that. We are never nearer to evil than when we
believe that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are handsomer than ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>observed Felix, irrelevantly.

<p/>Gertrude had got used to hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) say this. There was not so much
excitement in it as at first. <div class="bookquote">``What ought one to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``To
give parties, to go to the theatre, to read novels, to keep late hours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it's what one does or one doesn't do that promotes
enjoyment,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) companion answered. <div class="bookquote">``It is the general way of looking at
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They look at it as a discipline--that's what they do here. I have often
been told that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's very good. But there is another way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>added Felix,
smiling: <div class="bookquote">``to look at it as an opportunity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An opportunity--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``One would get more pleasure that
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't attempt to say anything better for it than that it has been my
own way--and that is not saying much!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix had laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) palette
and brushes; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was leaning back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) arms folded, to judge
the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``And you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am a very petty
personage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a great deal of talent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man rejoined, in a tone of cheerful impartiality,
<div class="bookquote">``I have not a great deal of talent. It is nothing at all remarkable.
I assure you I should know if it were. I shall always be obscure. The
world will never hear of me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Gertrude looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a strange
feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was thinking of the great world which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
did not, and how full of brilliant talents it must be, since it could
afford to make light of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) abilities. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't in general attach
much importance to anything I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursued; <div class="bookquote">``but you may
believe me when I say this,--that I am little better than a good-natured
feather-head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A feather-head?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a species of Bohemian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Bohemian?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude had never heard this term before, save as a
geographical denomination; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) quite failed to understand the
figurative meaning which her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) companion appeared to attach to it. But it
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) pleasure.

<p/>Felix had pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) chair and risen to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) feet; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) slowly came
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I am a sort of adventurer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said, looking down
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) got up, meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) smile. <div class="bookquote">``An adventurer?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``I should
like to hear your adventures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was going to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) hand; but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own hands suddenly into the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) painting-jacket.
<div class="bookquote">``There is no reason why you shouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have been an
adventurer, but my adventures have been very innocent. They have all
been happy ones; I don't think there are any I shouldn't tell. They were
very pleasant and very pretty; I should like to go over them in memory.
Sit down again, and I will begin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) added in a moment, with his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
naturally persuasive smile.

<p/>Gertrude sat down again on that day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sat down on several other
days. Felix, while he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) plied his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) brush, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a great many stories,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) listened with charmed avidity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) eyes rested upon his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lips;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was very serious; sometimes, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) air of wondering gravity, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was displeased. But Felix never believed for more than a
single moment in any displeasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own producing. This would have
been fatuity if the optimism it expressed had not been much more a hope
than a prejudice. It is beside the matter to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had a good
conscience; for the best conscience is a sort of self-reproach, and this
young man's brilliantly healthy nature spent itself in objective good
intentions which were ignorant of any test save exactness in hitting
their mark. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told Gertrude how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had walked over France and Italy
with a painter's knapsack on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, paying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way often by knocking
off a flattering portrait of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) host or hostess. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had played the violin in a little band of musicians--not of high
celebrity--who traveled through foreign lands giving provincial
concerts. He (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) also how he (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) had been a momentary ornament of a
troupe of strolling actors, engaged in the arduous task of interpreting
Shakespeare to French and German, Polish and Hungarian audiences.

<p/>While this periodical recital was going on, Gertrude lived in a
fantastic world; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) seemed to herself to be reading a romance that
came out in daily numbers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had known nothing so delightful since
the perusal of _Nicholas Nickleby_. One afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
cousin, Mrs. Acton, Robert's mother, who was a great invalid, never
leaving the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) came back alone, on foot, across the fields--this
being a short way which they often used. Felix had gone to Boston with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father, who desired to take the young man to call upon some of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
friends, old gentlemen who remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother--remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but
said nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--and several of whom, with the gentle ladies
their wives, had driven out from town to pay their respects at the
little house among the apple trees, in vehicles which reminded the
Baroness, who received her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) visitors with discriminating civility, of
the large, light, rattling barouche in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) herself had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
journey to this neighborhood. The afternoon was waning; in the western
sky the great picture of a New England sunset, painted in crimson
and silver, was suspended from the zenith; and the stony pastures, as
Gertrude traversed them, thinking intently to herself, were covered with
a light, clear glow. At the open gate of one of the fields she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) saw from
the distance a man's figure; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood there as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were waiting for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) came nearer she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) recognized Mr. Brand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had a feeling
as of not having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) for some time; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) could not have said for
how long, for it yet seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had been very lately at the
house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I walk back with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) asked. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
might if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) wanted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) and recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
half a mile away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have very good eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have very good eyes, Miss Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) meant something; but for a long time past Mr. Brand
had constantly meant something, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had almost got used to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
felt, however, that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) meant had now a renewed power to disturb
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), to perplex and agitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) walked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) in silence for a
moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I have had no trouble in seeing that you are
beginning to avoid me. But perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``one needn't have had
very good eyes to see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not avoided you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you have been unconscious that you were avoiding me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand
replied. <div class="bookquote">``You have not even known that I was there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are here now, Mr. Brand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, with a little laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``I know that very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) made no rejoinder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) simply walked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) slowly, as they were
obliged to walk over the soft grass. Presently they came to another
gate, which was closed. Mr. Brand laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hand upon it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) made no
movement to open it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) stood and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``You are very
much interested--very much absorbed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) said.

<p/>Gertrude glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was pale and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) looked
excited. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had never seen Mr. Brand excited before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) felt
that the spectacle, if fully carried out, would be impressive, almost
painful. <div class="bookquote">``Absorbed in what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked away at the
illuminated sky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) felt guilty and uncomfortable, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was
vexed with herself for feeling so. But Mr. Brand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) stood there
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) small, kind, persistent eyes, represented an
immense body of half-obliterated obligations, that were rising again
into a certain distinctness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have new interests, new occupations,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know
that I can say that you have new duties. We have always old ones,
Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please open the gate, Mr. Brand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) felt as if, in
saying so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) were cowardly and petulant. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) opened the gate, and
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) to pass; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) closed it behind himself. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had
time to turn away he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hand and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) an instant by the
wrist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to say something to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what you want to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) answered. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was on the point of
adding, <div class="bookquote">``And I know just how you will say it;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but these words she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) kept
back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love you, Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I love you very much; I love you more
than ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) said the words just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had known he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) would; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had heard them
before. They had no charm for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had said to herself before that
it was very strange. It was supposed to be delightful for a woman to
listen to such words; but these seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flat and mechanical. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish you would forget that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I--why should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have made you no promise--given you no pledge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice trembling a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have let me feel that I have an influence over you. You have opened
your mind to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never opened my mind to you, Mr. Brand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude cried, with some
vehemence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you were not so frank as I thought--as we all thought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what anyone else had to do with it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean your father and your sister. You know it makes them happy to
think you will listen to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) gave a little laugh. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't make them happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing makes them happy. No one is happy here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think your cousin is very happy--Mr. Young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Brand, in a
soft, almost timid tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>And Gertrude gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) little laugh again.

<p/>The young man looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``You are very much changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not. I have known you a long time, and I have loved you as you
were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``I must be going home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side, gave a little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly do avoid me--you see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Avoid me, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again; and then, very gently, <div class="bookquote">``No I will not avoid
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``but I will leave you, for the present, to yourself.
I think you will remember--after a while--some of the things you have
forgotten. I think you will come back to me; I have great faith in
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This time his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice was very touching; there was a strong, reproachful
force in what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, and Gertrude could answer nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned
away and stood there, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbows on the gate and looking at the
beautiful sunset. Gertrude left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) way home again; but
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) reached the middle of the next field she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) suddenly burst into
tears. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) tears seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) to have been a long time gathering, and
for some moments it was a kind of glee to shed them. But they presently
passed away. There was something a little hard about Gertrude; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
never wept again.



<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>Going of an afternoon to call upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) niece, Mr. Wentworth more than
once found Robert Acton sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) little drawing-room. This was in
no degree, to Mr. Wentworth, a perturbing fact, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had no sense
of competing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) young kinsman for Eugenia's good graces. Madame
Münster's uncle had the highest opinion of Robert Acton, who, indeed, in
the family at large, was the object of a great deal of undemonstrative
appreciation. They were all proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), in so far as the charge
of being proud may be brought against people who were, habitually,
distinctly guiltless of the misdemeanor known as <div class="bookquote">``taking credit.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>They
never boasted of Robert Acton, nor indulged in vainglorious reference to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>); they never quoted the clever things he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had said, nor mentioned the
generous things he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had done. But a sort of frigidly-tender faith in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) unlimited goodness was a part of their personal sense of right; and
there can, perhaps, be no better proof of the high esteem in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
was held than the fact that no explicit judgment was ever passed upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) actions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was no more praised than he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was blamed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was
tacitly felt to be an ornament to his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) circle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was the man of the
world of the family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had been to China and brought home a collection
of curiosities; he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had made a fortune--or rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had quintupled a
fortune already considerable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was distinguished by that combination
of celibacy, <div class="bookquote">``property,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and good humor which appeals to even the
most subdued imaginations; and it was taken for granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) would
presently place these advantages at the disposal of some well-regulated
young woman of his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) own <div class="bookquote">``set.''  (<font color='red'><b>some woman</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth was not a man to admit to
himself that--his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) paternal duties apart--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) liked any individual much
better than all other individuals; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) thought Robert Acton extremely
judicious; and this was perhaps as near an approach as he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was capable of
to the eagerness of preference, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) temperament repudiated as it
would have disengaged itself from something slightly unchaste. Acton
was, in fact, very judicious--and something more beside; and indeed it
must be claimed for Mr. Wentworth that in the more illicit parts of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) preference there hovered the vague adumbration of a belief that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) cousin's final merit was a certain enviable capacity for whistling,
rather gallantly, at the sanctions of mere judgment--for showing a
larger courage, a finer quality of pluck, than common occasion demanded.
Mr. Wentworth would never have risked the intimation that Acton was
made, in the smallest degree, of the stuff of a hero; but this is small
blame to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), for Robert would certainly never have risked it himself.
Acton certainly exercised great discretion in all things--beginning with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) estimate of himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was by no means so much of a
man of the world as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was supposed to be in local circles; but it must
be added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew also that his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) natural shrewdness had a reach
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had never quite given local circles the measure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was
addicted to taking the humorous view of things, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had discovered
that even in the narrowest circles such a disposition may find frequent
opportunities. Such opportunities had formed for some time--that is,
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) return from China, a year and a half before--the most active
element in this gentleman's life, which had just now a rather indolent
air. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was perfectly willing to get married. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very fond of
books, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a handsome library; that is, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) books were much more
numerous than Mr. Wentworth's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was also very fond of pictures; but it
must be confessed, in the fierce light of contemporary criticism, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) walls were adorned with several rather abortive masterpieces. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
got his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) learning--and there was more of it than commonly appeared--at
Harvard College; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) took a pleasure in old associations, which made
it a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daily contentment to live so near this institution that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) often passed it in driving to Boston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was extremely interested in
the Baroness Münster.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) was very frank with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); or at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) intended to be. <div class="bookquote">``I am
sure you find it very strange that I should have settled down in this
out-of-the-way part of the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) three or four weeks
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Münster</b></font>) had installed herself. <div class="bookquote">``I am certain you are wondering about
my motives. They are very pure.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Baroness</b></font>)</div>The Baroness by this time was an old
inhabitant; the best society in Boston had called upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), and Clifford
Wentworth had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) several times to drive in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) buggy.

<p/>Robert Acton was seated near her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), playing with a fan; there were
always several fans lying about her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) drawing-room, with long ribbons of
different colors attached to them, and Acton was always playing with
one. <div class="bookquote">``No, I don't find it at all strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said slowly, smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``That a clever woman should turn up in Boston, or its suburbs--that does
not require so much explanation. Boston is a very nice place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you wish to make me contradict you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, <div class="bookquote">``_vous vous
y prenez mal_. In certain moods there is nothing I am not capable
of agreeing to. Boston is a paradise, and we are in the suburbs of
Paradise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now I am not at all in the suburbs; I am in the place itself,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>rejoined Acton, who was lounging a little in his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was, however,
not always lounging; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was not quite so relaxed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
pretended. To a certain extent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) sought refuge from shyness in
this appearance of relaxation; and like many persons in the same
circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) somewhat exaggerated the appearance. Beyond this, the
air of being much at his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) ease was a cover for vigilant observation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
was more than interested in this clever woman, who, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) might
say, was clever not at all after the Boston fashion; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plunged him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
into a kind of excitement, held him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) in vague suspense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was obliged to
admit to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had never yet seen a woman just like this--not
even in China. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was ashamed, for inscrutable reasons, of the vivacity
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) emotion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) carried it off, superficially, by taking, still
superficially, the humorous view of Madame Münster. It was not at all
true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) thought it very natural of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to have made this pious
pilgrimage. It might have been said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) in advance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was too
good a Bostonian to regard in the light of an eccentricity the desire of
even the remotest alien to visit the New England metropolis. This was an
impulse for which, surely, no apology was needed; and Madame Münster
was the fortunate possessor of several New England cousins. In fact,
however, Madame Münster struck him (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>) as out of keeping with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little
circle; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at the best a very agreeable, a gracefully mystifying
anomaly. He (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>) knew very well that it would not do to address these
reflections too crudely to Mr. Wentworth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would never have remarked
to the old gentleman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wondered what the Baroness was up to. And
indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had no great desire to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) vague mistrust with anyone.
There was a personal pleasure in it; the greatest pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had known
at least since he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had come from China. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would keep the Baroness, for
better or worse, to himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had a feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) deserved to
enjoy a monopoly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was certainly the person who had most
adequately gauged her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) capacity for social intercourse. Before long it
became apparent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) that the Baroness was disposed to lay no tax upon
such a monopoly.

<p/>One day -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was sitting there again and playing with a fan-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) to apologize, should the occasion present itself, to certain people
in Boston for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) not having returned their calls. <div class="bookquote">``There are half a
dozen places,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``a formidable list. Charlotte Wentworth has
written it out for me, in a terrifically distinct hand. There is
no ambiguity on the subject; I know perfectly where I must go. Mr.
Wentworth informs me that the carriage is always at my disposal, and
Charlotte offers to go with me, in a pair of tight gloves and a very
stiff petticoat. And yet for three days I have been putting it off. They
must think me horribly vicious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ask me to apologize,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, <div class="bookquote">``but you don't tell me what
excuse I can offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness declared, <div class="bookquote">``than I am held to. It would be
like my asking you to buy me a bouquet and giving you the money. I have
no reason except that--somehow--it's too violent an effort. It is not
inspiring. Wouldn't that serve as an excuse, in Boston? I am told they
are very sincere; they don't tell fibs. And then Felix ought to go with
me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is never in readiness. I don't see him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is always roaming
about the fields and sketching old barns, or taking ten-mile walks, or
painting someone's portrait, or rowing on the pond, or flirting with
Gertrude Wentworth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it would amuse you to go and see a few people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said
Acton. <div class="bookquote">``You are having a very quiet time of it here. It's a dull life
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, the quiet,--the quiet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``That's what I
like. It's rest. That's what I came here for. Amusement? I have had
amusement. And as for seeing people--I have already seen a great many
in my life. If it didn't sound ungracious I should say that I wish very
humbly your people here would leave me alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) a moment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was a woman who
took being looked at remarkably well. <div class="bookquote">``So you have come here for rest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I may say. I came for many of those reasons that are no
reasons--don't you know?--and yet that are really the best: to come
away, to change, to break with everything. When once one comes away one
must arrive somewhere, and I asked myself why I shouldn't arrive here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly had time on the way!''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, laughing.

<p/>Madame Münster looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) again; and then, smiling: <div class="bookquote">``And I have
certainly had time, since I got here, to ask myself why I came. However,
I never ask myself idle questions. Here I am, and it seems to me you
ought only to thank me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you go away you will see the difficulties I shall put in your
path.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to put difficulties in my path?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) asked, rearranging the
rosebud in her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) corsage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The greatest of all--that of having been so agreeable--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I shall be unable to depart? Don't be too sure. I have left some
very agreeable people over there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, <div class="bookquote">``but it was to come here, where I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know of your existence. Excuse me for saying anything so rude;
but, honestly speaking, I did not. No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness pursued, <div class="bookquote">``it was
precisely not to see you--such people as you--that I came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such people as me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>cried Acton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a sort of longing to come into those natural relations which I
knew I should find here. Over there I had only, as I may say, artificial
relations. Don't you see the difference?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The difference tells against me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am an
artificial relation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Conventional,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>declared the Baroness; <div class="bookquote">``very conventional.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there is one way in which the relation of a lady and a gentleman
may always become natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean by their becoming lovers? That may be natural or not. And at
any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>rejoined Eugenia, _<div class="bookquote">``nous n’en sommes pas là!'' (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>_

<p/>They were not, as yet; but a little later, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) began to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>)
to drive, it might almost have seemed that they were. He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) came for her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
several times, alone, in his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) high <div class="bookquote">``wagon,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>drawn by a pair of charming
light-limbed horses. It was different, her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) having gone with Clifford
Wentworth, who was her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) cousin, and so much younger. It was not to be
imagined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) should have a flirtation with Clifford, who was a mere
shame-faced boy, and whom a large section of Boston society supposed to
be <div class="bookquote">``engaged''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>to Lizzie Acton. Not, indeed, that it was to be conceived
that the Baroness was a possible party to any flirtation whatever; for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was undoubtedly a married lady. It was generally known that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
matrimonial condition was of the <div class="bookquote">``morganatic''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>order; but in its natural
aversion to suppose that this meant anything less than absolute wedlock,
the conscience of the community took refuge in the belief that it
implied something even more.

<p/>Acton wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) to think highly of American scenery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
to great distances, picking out the prettiest roads and the largest
points of view. If we are good when we are contented, Eugenia's virtues
should now certainly have been uppermost; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) found a charm in the
rapid movement through a wild country, and in a companion who from time
to time made the vehicle dip, with a motion like a swallow's flight,
over roads of primitive construction, and who, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) felt, would do
a great many things that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) might ask him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). Sometimes, for a couple
of hours together, there were almost no houses; there were nothing but
woods and rivers and lakes and horizons adorned with bright-looking
mountains. It seemed to the Baroness very wild, as I have said,
and lovely; but the impression added something to that sense of the
enlargement of opportunity which had been born of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) arrival in the New
World.

<p/>One day--it was late in the afternoon--Acton pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) horses on the
crest of a hill which commanded a beautiful prospect. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) let them stand
a long time to rest, while he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sat there and talked with Madame Münster.
The prospect was beautiful in spite of there being nothing human within
sight. There was a wilderness of woods, and the gleam of a distant
river, and a glimpse of half the hill-tops in Massachusetts. The road
had a wide, grassy margin, on the further side of which there flowed a
deep, clear brook; there were wild flowers in the grass, and beside the
brook lay the trunk of a fallen tree. Acton waited a while; at last a
rustic wayfarer came trudging along the road. Acton asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) to hold
the horses--a service he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) consented to render, as a friendly turn to a
fellow-citizen. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) invited the Baroness to descend, and the two
wandered away, across the grass, and sat down on the log beside the
brook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine it doesn't remind you of Silberstadt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton. It was
the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had mentioned Silberstadt to her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), for particular
reasons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had a husband there, and this was disagreeable to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>); and, furthermore, it had been repeated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) that this husband
wished to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) away--a state of affairs to which even indirect
reference was to be deprecated. It was true, nevertheless, that the
Baroness herself had often alluded to Silberstadt; and Acton had often
wondered why her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) husband wished to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>). It was a curious
position for a lady--this being known as a repudiated wife; and it is
worthy of observation that the Baroness carried it off with exceeding
grace and dignity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had made it felt, from the first, that there were
two sides to the question, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) own side, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) should choose
to present it, would be replete with touching interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not remind me of the town, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``of the
sculptured gables and the Gothic churches, of the wonderful Schloss,
with its moat and its clustering towers. But it has a little look of
some other parts of the principality. One might fancy one's self among
those grand old German forests, those legendary mountains; the sort of
country one sees from the windows at Schreckenstein.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is Schreckenstein?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>asked Acton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great castle,--the summer residence of the Reigning Prince.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever lived there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have stayed there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. Acton was silent; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked a
while at the uncastled landscape before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is the first time you
have ever asked me about Silberstadt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I should think you
would want to know about my marriage; it must seem to you very strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Now you wouldn't like me to say that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You Americans have such odd ways!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>the Baroness declared. <div class="bookquote">``You never
ask anything outright; there seem to be so many things you can't talk
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We Americans are very polite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, whose national consciousness
had been complicated by a residence in foreign lands, and who yet
disliked to hear Americans abused. <div class="bookquote">``We don't like to tread upon
people's toes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I should like very much to hear about your
marriage. Now tell me how it came about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Prince fell in love with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>replied the Baroness simply. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) suit very hard. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) didn't wish me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>);
on the contrary. But on that basis I refused to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
offered me marriage--in so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might. I was young, and I confess
I was rather flattered. But if it were to be done again now, I certainly
should not accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long ago was this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>asked Acton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--several years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia. <div class="bookquote">``You should never ask a woman for
dates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>``Why, I should think that when a woman was relating history `` Acton
answered. <div class="bookquote">``And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wants to break it off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They want him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to make a political marriage. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) brother's idea.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) brother is very clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They must be a precious pair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert Acton/Robert</b></font>)</div>cried Robert Acton.

<p/>The Baroness gave a little philosophic shrug. <div class="bookquote">``_Que voulez-vous?_ They
are princes. They think they are treating me very well. Silberstadt is
a perfectly despotic little state, and the Reigning Prince may annul the
marriage by a stroke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) pen. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has promised me, nevertheless,
not to do so without my formal consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this you have refused?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hitherto. It is an indignity, and I have wished at least to make it
difficult for them. But I have a little document in my writing-desk
which I have only to sign and send back to the Prince.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it will be all over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) hand, and dropped it again. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall
keep my title; at least, I shall be at liberty to keep it if I choose.
And I suppose I shall keep it. One must have a name. And I shall keep my
pension. It is very small--it is wretchedly small; but it is what I live
on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have only to sign that paper?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton asked.

<p/>The Baroness looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Do you urge it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) got up slowly, and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) pockets. <div class="bookquote">``What do you
gain by not doing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am supposed to gain this advantage--that if I delay, or temporize,
the Prince may come back to me, may make a stand against his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) brother.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is very fond of me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) brother has pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) only little by
little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) were to come back to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, <div class="bookquote">``would you--would you take
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness met his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) eyes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) colored just a little. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) rose. ``I
should have the satisfaction of saying, `Now it is my turn. I break with
your Serene Highness!'''

<p/>They began to walk toward the carriage. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert Acton/Robert</b></font>)</div>said Robert Acton, <div class="bookquote">``it's
a curious story! How did you make his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) acquaintance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert Acton/Robert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was staying with an old lady--an old Countess--in Dresden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had
been a friend of my father's. My father was dead; I was very much alone.
My brother was wandering about the world in a theatrical troupe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother ought to have stayed with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton observed, <div class="bookquote">``and kept
you from putting your trust in princes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness was silent a moment, and then, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sent me money. The old Countess encouraged the Prince; she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
was even pressing. It seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Münster added, gently,
<div class="bookquote">``that--under the circumstances--I behaved very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), and made the observation--he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had made it
before--that a woman looks the prettier for having unfolded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrongs
or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sufferings. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) reflected, audibly, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to see
you send his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Serene Highness--somewhere!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Münster stooped and plucked a daisy from the grass. <div class="bookquote">``And not sign
my renunciation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know--I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In one case I should have my revenge; in another case I should have my
liberty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton gave a little laugh as he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) into the carriage. <div class="bookquote">``At any
rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``take good care of that paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A couple of days afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) to come and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) house. The
visit had already been proposed, but it had been put off in consequence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) mother's illness. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a constant invalid, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had passed
these recent years, very patiently, in a great flowered arm-chair at
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bedroom window. Lately, for some days, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been unable to see
anyone; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was better, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sent the Baroness a very civil
message. Acton had wished their visitor to come to dinner; but Madame
Münster preferred to begin with a simple call. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had reflected that
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) should go to dinner Mr. Wentworth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughters would also
be asked, and it had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) that the peculiar character of the
occasion would be best preserved in a _tête-à-tête_ with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) host. Why
the occasion should have a peculiar character she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) explained to no one.
As far as anyone could see, it was simply very pleasant. Acton came for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) and drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) door, an operation which was rapidly performed.
His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) house the Baroness mentally pronounced a very good one; more
articulately, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) declared that it was enchanting. It was large and
square and painted brown; it stood in a well-kept shrubbery, and was
approached, from the gate, by a short drive. It was, moreover, a much
more modern dwelling than Mr. Wentworth's, and was more redundantly
upholstered and expensively ornamented. The Baroness perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
entertainer had analyzed material comfort to a sufficiently fine point.
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>entertainer</b></font>) possessed the most delightful _chinoiseries_--trophies of
his (<font color='blue'><b>entertainer</b></font>) sojourn in the Celestial Empire: pagodas of ebony and cabinets of
ivory; sculptured monsters, grinning and leering on chimney-pieces,
in front of beautifully figured hand-screens; porcelain dinner-sets,
gleaming behind the glass doors of mahogany buffets; large screens,
in corners, covered with tense silk and embroidered with mandarins and
dragons. These things were scattered all over the house, and they gave
Eugenia a pretext for a complete domiciliary visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) liked it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
enjoyed it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) thought it a very nice place. It had a mixture of the
homely and the liberal, and though it was almost a museum, the large,
little-used rooms were as fresh and clean as a well-kept dairy. Lizzie
Acton told her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) dusted all the pagodas and other curiosities
every day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) own hands; and the Baroness answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was
evidently a household fairy. Lizzie had not at all the look of a young
lady who dusted things; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) wore such pretty dresses and had such
delicate fingers that it was difficult to imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) immersed in sordid
cares. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) came to meet Madame Münster on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) arrival, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) said
nothing, or almost nothing, and the Baroness again reflected--she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had
had occasion to do so before--that American girls had no manners. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
disliked this little American girl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was quite prepared to learn
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had failed to commend herself to Miss Acton. Lizzie struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) as positive and explicit almost to pertness; and the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>)
combining the apparent incongruities of a taste for housework and the
wearing of fresh, Parisian-looking dresses suggested the possession of a
dangerous energy. It was a source of irritation to the Baroness that
in this country it should seem to matter whether a little girl were a
trifle less or a trifle more of a nonentity; for Eugenia had hitherto
been conscious of no moral pressure as regards the appreciation of
diminutive virgins. It was perhaps an indication of Lizzie's pertness
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) very soon retired and left the Baroness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother's hands.
Acton talked a great deal about his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) _chinoiseries_; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew a good deal
about porcelain and bric-à-brac. The Baroness, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) progress through
the house, made, as it were, a great many stations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) sat down
everywhere, confessed to being a little tired, and asked about the
various objects with a curious mixture of alertness and inattention. If
there had been anyone to say it to she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) would have declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
was positively in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) host; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) could hardly make this
declaration--even in the strictest confidence--to Acton himself. It gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), nevertheless, a pleasure that had some of the charm of unwontedness
to feel, with that admirable keenness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was capable of
feeling things, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had a disposition without any edges; that even
his (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) humorous irony always expanded toward the point. One's impression of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) honesty was almost like carrying a bunch of flowers; the perfume was
most agreeable, but they were occasionally an inconvenience. One could
trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), at any rate, round all the corners of the world; and, withal,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was not absolutely simple, which would have been excess; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was only
relatively simple, which was quite enough for the Baroness.

<p/>Lizzie reappeared to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) mother would now be happy to receive
Madame Münster; and the Baroness followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) to Mrs. Acton's apartment.
Eugenia reflected, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) went, that it was not the affectation of
impertinence that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) dislike this young lady, for on that ground
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) could easily have beaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>). It was not an aspiration on the girl's
part to rivalry, but a kind of laughing, childishly-mocking indifference
to the results of comparison. Mrs. Acton was an emaciated, sweet-faced
woman of five and fifty, sitting with pillows behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), and looking
out on a clump of hemlocks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was very modest, very timid, and very
ill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) made Eugenia feel grateful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) herself was not like
that--neither so ill, nor, possibly, so modest. On a chair, beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>),
lay a volume of Emerson's Essays. It was a great occasion for poor Mrs.
Acton, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) helpless condition, to be confronted with a clever foreign
lady, who had more manner than any lady--any dozen ladies--that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
ever seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard a great deal about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, softly, to the
Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From your son, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Eugenia asked. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has talked to me immensely of
you. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) talks of you as you would like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness declared; <div class="bookquote">``as
such a son _must_ talk of such a mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Acton sat gazing; this was part of Madame Münster's <div class="bookquote">``manner.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>But
Robert Acton was gazing too, in vivid consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had barely
mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) mother to their brilliant guest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) never talked of this
still maternal presence,--a presence refined to such delicacy that it
had almost resolved itself, with him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), simply into the subjective emotion
of gratitude. And Acton rarely talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) emotions. The Baroness
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) smile toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) instantly felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had been
observed to be fibbing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had struck a false note. But who were these
people to whom such fibbing was not pleasing? If they were annoyed, the
Baroness was equally so; and after the exchange of a few civil inquiries
and low-voiced responses she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) took leave of Mrs. Acton. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) begged Robert
not to come home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) would get into the carriage alone;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) preferred that. This was imperious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) looked
disappointed. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) stood before the door with him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)--the carriage was
turning in the gravel-walk--this thought restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) serenity.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hand in farewell she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) a moment.
<div class="bookquote">``I have almost decided to dispatch that paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) alluded to the document that she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
renunciation; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) into the carriage without saying
anything. But just before the vehicle began to move he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, when
you have in fact dispatched it, I hope you will let me know!''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>Felix Young finished Gertrude's portrait, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) afterwards transferred
to canvas the features of many members of that circle of which it may
be said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had become for the time the pivot and the centre. I am
afraid it must be confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was a decidedly flattering painter,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) imparted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) models a romantic grace which seemed easily
and cheaply acquired by the payment of a hundred dollars to a young man
who made <div class="bookquote">``sitting''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>so entertaining. For Felix was paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pictures,
making, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, no secret of the fact that in guiding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steps to
the Western world affectionate curiosity had gone hand in hand with a
desire to better his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle's portrait quite as if
Mr. Wentworth had never averted himself from the experiment; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
compassed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) end only by the exercise of gentle violence, it is but
fair to add that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) allowed the old man to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) arm into Mr. Wentworth's one summer morning--very
few arms indeed had ever passed into Mr. Wentworth's--and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) across
the garden and along the road into the studio which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had extemporized
in the little house among the apple trees. The grave gentleman felt
himself more and more fascinated by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) clever nephew, whose fresh,
demonstrative youth seemed a compendium of experiences so strangely
numerous. It appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that Felix must know a great deal; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would
like to learn what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought about some of those things as regards
which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own conversation had always been formal, but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knowledge
vague. Felix had a confident, gayly trenchant way of judging human
actions which Mr. Wentworth grew little by little to envy; it seemed
like criticism made easy. Forming an opinion--say on a person's
conduct--was, with Mr. Wentworth, a good deal like fumbling in a lock
with a key chosen at hazard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) seemed to himself to go about the world
with a big bunch of these ineffectual instruments at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) girdle. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
nephew, on the other hand, with a single turn of the wrist, opened
any door as adroitly as a horse-thief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) felt obliged to keep up the
convention that an uncle is always wiser than a nephew, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) could
keep it up no otherwise than by listening in serious silence to Felix's
quick, light, constant discourse. But there came a day when he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) lapsed
from consistency and almost asked his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) nephew's advice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever entertained the idea of settling in the United States?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) asked one morning, while Felix brilliantly plied his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) brush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``excuse me if your question makes me smile
a little. To begin with, I have never entertained an idea. Ideas often
entertain _me_; but I am afraid I have never seriously made a plan. I
know what you are going to say; or rather, I know what you think, for
I don't think you will say it--that this is very frivolous and
loose-minded on my part. So it is; but I am made like that; I take
things as they come, and somehow there is always some new thing
to follow the last. In the second place, I should never propose to
_settle_. I can't settle, my dear uncle; I'm not a settler. I know that
is what strangers are supposed to do here; they always settle. But I
haven't--to answer your question--entertained that idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You intend to return to Europe and resume your irregular manner of
life?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say I intend. But it's very likely I shall go back to Europe.
After all, I am a European. I feel that, you know. It will depend a good
deal upon my sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s even more of a European than I; here, you
know, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s a picture out of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) setting. And as for `resuming,' dear
uncle, I really have never given up my irregular manner of life. What,
for me, could be more irregular than this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Than what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Wentworth, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) pale gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, than everything! Living in the midst of you, this way; this
charming, quiet, serious family life; fraternizing with Charlotte and
Gertrude; calling upon twenty young ladies and going out to walk with
them; sitting with you in the evening on the piazza and listening to the
crickets, and going to bed at ten o’clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your description is very animated,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth; <div class="bookquote">``but I see
nothing improper in what you describe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither do I, dear uncle. It is extremely delightful; I shouldn't
like it if it were improper. I assure you I don't like improper things;
though I dare say you think I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix went on, painting away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never accused you of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``because, you see, at bottom I am a terrible
Philistine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Philistine?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, as one may say, a plain, God-fearing man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) reservedly, like a mystified sage, and Felix continued, <div class="bookquote">``I trust
I shall enjoy a venerable and venerated old age. I mean to live long.
I can hardly call that a plan, perhaps; but it's a keen desire--a rosy
vision. I shall be a lively, perhaps even a frivolous old man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle sententiously</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle, sententiously, <div class="bookquote">``that one should desire
to prolong an agreeable life. We have perhaps a selfish indisposition
to bring our pleasure to a close. But I presume,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle sententiously</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that you
expect to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That too, dear uncle, is a hope, a desire, a vision,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. It
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) for an instant that this was possibly a preface to the
offer of the hand of one of Mr. Wentworth's admirable daughters. But in
the name of decent modesty and a proper sense of the hard realities of
this world, Felix banished the thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle was the incarnation
of benevolence, certainly; but from that to accepting--much more
postulating--the idea of a union between a young lady with a dowry
presumptively brilliant and a penniless artist with no prospect of
fame, there was a very long way. Felix had lately become conscious of
a luxurious preference for the society--if possible unshared with
others--of Gertrude Wentworth; but he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had relegated this young lady,
for the moment, to the coldly brilliant category of unattainable
possessions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was not the first woman for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had entertained
an unpractical admiration. He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had been in love with duchesses and
countesses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had made, once or twice, a perilously near approach
to cynicism in declaring that the disinterestedness of women had been
overrated. On the whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had tempered audacity with modesty; and
it is but fair to him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) now to say explicitly that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) would have been
incapable of taking advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) present large allowance of
familiarity to make love to the younger of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) handsome cousins. Felix
had grown up among traditions in the light of which such a proceeding
looked like a grievous breach of hospitality. I have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was
always happy, and it may be counted among the present sources of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>)
happiness that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had as regards this matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) relations with
Gertrude a deliciously good conscience. His (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) own deportment seemed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) suffused with the beauty of virtue--a form of beauty that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) admired
with the same vivacity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) admired all other forms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that if you marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth presently, <div class="bookquote">``it will
conduce to your happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Sicurissimo!'' (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>_ Felix exclaimed; and then, arresting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) brush, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``There is something I feel tempted to
say to you. May I risk it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth drew himself up a little. <div class="bookquote">``I am very safe; I don't repeat
things.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hoped Felix would not risk too much.

<p/>Felix was laughing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's odd to hear you telling me how to be happy. I don't think you know
yourself, dear uncle. Now, does that sound brutal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man was silent a moment, and then, with a dry dignity that
suddenly touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) nephew: <div class="bookquote">``We may sometimes point out a road we are
unable to follow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, don't tell me you have had any sorrows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
suppose it, and I didn't mean to allude to them. I simply meant that you
all don't amuse yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amuse ourselves? We are not children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely not! You have reached the proper age. I was saying that the
other day to Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix added. <div class="bookquote">``I hope it was not indiscreet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, with a keener irony than Felix would
have thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) capable of, <div class="bookquote">``it was but your way of amusing yourself. I
am afraid you have never had a trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix declared, with some spirit; <div class="bookquote">``before I knew
better. But you don't catch me at it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth maintained for a while a silence more expressive than a
deep-drawn sigh. <div class="bookquote">``You have no children,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``that your charming young people are a
source of grief to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't speak of Charlotte.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>And then, after a pause, Mr. Wentworth
continued, <div class="bookquote">``I don't speak of Gertrude. But I feel considerable anxiety
about Clifford. I will tell you another time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>The next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) gave Felix a sitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) nephew reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) confidence. <div class="bookquote">``How is Clifford today?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix
asked. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) has always seemed to me a young man of remarkable discretion.
Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) is only too discreet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) seems on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) guard against me--as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) thought me rather light company. The other day he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
sister--Gertrude repeated it to me--that I was always laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>).
If I laugh it is simply from the impulse to try and inspire him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) with
confidence. That is the only way I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clifford's situation is no laughing matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``It is
very peculiar, as I suppose you have guessed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you mean his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) love affair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth stared, blushing a little. <div class="bookquote">``I mean his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) absence from
college. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) has been suspended. We have decided not to speak of it
unless we are asked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suspended?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) has been requested by the Harvard authorities to absent himself for
six months. Meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) is studying with Mr. Brand. We think Mr. Brand
will help him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>); at least we hope so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What befell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) at college?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix asked. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was too fond of pleasure?
Mr. Brand certainly will not teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) any of those secrets!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was too fond of something of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) should not have been fond. I
suppose it is considered a pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) light laugh. <div class="bookquote">``My dear uncle, is there any doubt about its
being a pleasure? _C’est de son âge_, as they say in France.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have said rather it was a vice of later life--of disappointed
old age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) lifted eyebrows, and then, <div class="bookquote">``Of what
are you speaking?''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) demanded, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of the situation in which Clifford was found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) was found--he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) was caught?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Necessarily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) was caught. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) couldn't walk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) staggered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) drinks! I rather suspected that, from something I
observed the first day I came here. I quite agree with you that it is a
low taste. It's not a vice for a gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ought to give it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We hope for a good deal from Mr. Brand's influence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth went
on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) has talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) from the first. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) never touches anything
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)--I will talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix declared, gayly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle, with some apprehension.

<p/>Felix for some moments answered nothing. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) asked at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>echoed Mr. Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) cousin would
want to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no understanding, then, with Mrs. Acton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth stared, almost blankly. <div class="bookquote">``I have never discussed such
subjects with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it might be time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``Lizzie Acton is
admirably pretty, and if Clifford is dangerous...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``I have no reason to suppose
they are engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Par exemple!'' (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>_ cried Felix. <div class="bookquote">``A clandestine engagement? Trust me,
Clifford, as I say, is a charming boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is incapable of that. Lizzie
Acton, then, would not be jealous of another woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, with a vague sense of jealousy
being an even lower vice than a love of liquor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The best thing for Clifford, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix propounded, <div class="bookquote">``is to become
interested in some clever, charming woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
painting, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knees, looked with bright
communicativeness at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle. <div class="bookquote">``You see, I believe greatly in the
influence of women. Living with women helps to make a man a gentleman.
It is very true Clifford has his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) sisters, who are so charming. But there
should be a different sentiment in play from the fraternal, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
has Lizzie Acton; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), perhaps, is rather immature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect Lizzie has talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>), reasoned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the impropriety of getting tipsy--on the beauty of temperance? That
is dreary work for a pretty young girl. No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix continued; <div class="bookquote">``Clifford
ought to frequent some agreeable woman, who, without ever mentioning
such unsavory subjects, would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) a sense of its being very
ridiculous to be fuddled. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) could fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a little, so
much the better. The thing would operate as a cure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, what lady should you suggest?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a clever woman under your hand. My sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister--under my hand?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say a word to Clifford. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) to be bold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) is well disposed
already; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) has invited her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) two or three times to drive. But I don't
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) comes to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) a hint to come--to come often.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) will sit there of an afternoon, and they will talk. It will do him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth meditated. <div class="bookquote">``You think she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will exercise a helpful
influence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will exercise a civilizing--I may call it a sobering--influence. A
charming, clever, witty woman always does--especially if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a little
of a coquette. My dear uncle, the society of such women has been half
my education. If Clifford is suspended, as you say, from college, let
Eugenia be his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) preceptress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth continued thoughtful. <div class="bookquote">``You think Eugenia is a coquette?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What pretty woman is not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix demanded in turn. But this, for Mr.
Wentworth, could at the best have been no answer, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did not think
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) niece pretty. <div class="bookquote">``With Clifford,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man pursued, <div class="bookquote">``Eugenia will
simply be enough of a coquette to be a little ironical. That's what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) needs. So you recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) to be nice with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>), you know. The
suggestion will come best from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the old man, <div class="bookquote">``that I am to suggest to my son to
make a--a profession of--of affection to Madame Münster?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes--a profession!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix sympathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, as I understand it, Madame Münster is a married woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``of course she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will
do what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth sat for some time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) eyes on the floor; at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
got up. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that I can undertake to recommend my
son any such course.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And without meeting Felix's surprised glance he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
broke off his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sitting, which was not resumed for a fortnight.

<p/>Felix was very fond of the little lake which occupied so many of Mr.
Wentworth's numerous acres, and of a remarkable pine grove which lay
upon the further side of it, planted upon a steep embankment and haunted
by the summer breeze. The murmur of the air in the far off tree-tops
had a strange distinctness; it was almost articulate. One afternoon
the young man came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) painting-room and passed the open door of
Eugenia's little salon. Within, in the cool dimness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister,
dressed in white, buried in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) arm-chair, and holding to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face an
immense bouquet. Opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sat Clifford Wentworth, twirling his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
hat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had evidently just presented the bouquet to the Baroness, whose
fine eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) over the big roses and geraniums, wore
a conversational smile. Felix, standing on the threshold of the cottage,
hesitated for a moment as to whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should retrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) steps and
enter the parlor. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) way and passed into Mr. Wentworth's
garden. That civilizing process to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had suggested that Clifford
should be subjected appeared to have come on of itself. Felix was very
sure, at least, that Mr. Wentworth had not adopted his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) ingenious device
for stimulating the young man's aesthetic consciousness. <div class="bookquote">``Doubtless
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) supposes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said to himself, after the conversation that has been
narrated, <div class="bookquote">``that I desire, out of fraternal benevolence, to procure for
Eugenia the amusement of a flirtation--or, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) probably calls it, an
intrigue--with the too susceptible Clifford. It must be admitted--and
I have noticed it before--that nothing exceeds the license occasionally
taken by the imagination of very rigid people.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Felix, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own side,
had of course said nothing to Clifford; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) had observed to Eugenia
that Mr. Wentworth was much mortified at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) son's low tastes. <div class="bookquote">``We ought
to do something to help them, after all their kindness to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
added. <div class="bookquote">``Encourage Clifford to come and see you, and inspire him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) with a
taste for conversation. That will supplant the other, which only comes
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) puerility, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) not taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) position in the world--that
of a rich young man of ancient stock--seriously enough. Make him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
a little more serious. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) makes love to you it is no great
matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am to offer myself as a superior form of intoxication--a substitute
for a brandy bottle, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``Truly, in this country
one comes to strange uses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had not positively declined to undertake Clifford's higher
education, and Felix, who had not thought of the matter again, being
haunted with visions of more personal profit, now reflected that the
work of redemption had fairly begun. The idea in prospect had seemed
of the happiest, but in operation it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) a trifle uneasy. <div class="bookquote">``What if
Eugenia--what if Eugenia'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) asked himself softly; the question dying
away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) sense of Eugenia's undetermined capacity. But before Felix
had time either to accept or to reject its admonition, even in this
vague form, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) saw Robert Acton turn out of Mr. Wentworth's enclosure,
by a distant gate, and come toward the cottage in the orchard. Acton
had evidently walked from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) own house along a shady by-way and was
intending to pay a visit to Madame Münster. Felix watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) a moment;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) turned away. Acton could be left to play the part of Providence
and interrupt--if interruption were needed--Clifford's entanglement with
Eugenia.

<p/>Felix passed through the garden toward the house and toward a postern
gate which opened upon a path leading across the fields, beside a little
wood, to the lake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) stopped and looked up at the house; his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) eyes
rested more particularly upon a certain open window, on the shady side.
Presently Gertrude appeared there, looking out into the summer light. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) hat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) good-day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) was
going to row across the pond, and begged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) the
honor to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) a moment; then, without saying
anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) turned away. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) soon reappeared below in one of those
quaint and charming Leghorn hats, tied with white satin bows, that were
worn at that period; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) also carried a green parasol. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) went with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) to the edge of the lake, where a couple of boats were always moored;
they got into one of them, and Felix, with gentle strokes, propelled it
to the opposite shore. The day was the perfection of summer weather;
the little lake was the color of sunshine; the plash of the oars was the
only sound, and they found themselves listening to it. They disembarked,
and, by a winding path, ascended the pine-crested mound which overlooked
the water, whose white expanse glittered between the trees. The place
was delightfully cool, and had the added charm that--in the softly
sounding pine boughs--you seemed to hear the coolness as well as
feel it. Felix and Gertrude sat down on the rust-colored carpet of
pine-needles and talked of many things. Felix spoke at last, in the
course of talk, of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) going away; it was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had alluded
to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some day--when the leaves begin to fall. You know I can't stay
forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude transferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) eyes to the outer prospect, and then, after a
pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall never see you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>asked Felix. <div class="bookquote">``We shall probably both survive my departure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>But Gertrude only repeated, <div class="bookquote">``I shall never see you again. I shall never
hear of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I shall know nothing about you. I knew
nothing about you before, and it will be the same again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew nothing about you then, unfortunately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``But now I
shall write to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't write to me. I shall not answer you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should of course burn your letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/>Gertrude looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``Burn my letters? You sometimes say
strange things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not strange in themselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man answered. <div class="bookquote">``They are
only strange as said to you. You will come to Europe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With whom shall I come?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) asked this question simply; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was very
much in earnest. Felix was interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) earnestness; for some
moments he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``You can't tell me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) pursued. <div class="bookquote">``You can't
say that I shall go with my father and my sister; you don't believe
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall keep your letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, presently, for all answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never write. I don't know how to write.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude, for some time,
said nothing more; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) companion, as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), wished it had
not been <div class="bookquote">``disloyal''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>to make love to the daughter of an old gentleman who
had offered one hospitality. The afternoon waned; the shadows stretched
themselves; and the light grew deeper in the western sky. Two persons
appeared on the opposite side of the lake, coming from the house and
crossing the meadow. <div class="bookquote">``It is Charlotte and Mr. Brand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.
<div class="bookquote">``They are coming over here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Brand</b></font>)</div>But Charlotte and Mr. Brand only came down
to the edge of the water, and stood there, looking across; they made no
motion to enter the boat that Felix had left at the mooring-place. Felix
waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hat to them; it was too far to call. They made no visible
response, and they presently turned away and walked along the shore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brand is not demonstrative,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is never demonstrative
to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) sits silent, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) chin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hand, looking at me.
Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) looks away. Your father tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is so eloquent; and I
should like to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) looks like such a noble young man.
But with me he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) will never talk. And yet I am so fond of listening to
brilliant imagery!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is very eloquent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) has no brilliant imagery.
I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) talk a great deal. I knew that when they saw us they
would not come over here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is making _la cour_, as they say, to your sister? They desire to
be alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``they have no such reason as that for
being alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) make _la cour_ to Charlotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix inquired. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
is so pretty, so gentle, so good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked at the distantly-seen
couple they were discussing. Mr. Brand and Charlotte were walking side
by side. They might have been a pair of lovers, and yet they might not.
<div class="bookquote">``They think I should not be here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With me? I thought you didn't have those ideas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't understand. There are a great many things you don't
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand my stupidity. But why, then, do not Charlotte and Mr.
Brand, who, as an elder sister and a clergyman, are free to walk about
together, come over and make me wiser by breaking up the unlawful
interview into which I have lured you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the last thing they would do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/>Felix stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a moment, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) lifted eyebrows. _<div class="bookquote">``Je n'y
comprends rien!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) exclaimed; then his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) eyes followed for a while the
retreating figures of this critical pair. <div class="bookquote">``You may say what you please,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) declared; <div class="bookquote">``it is evident to me that your sister is not indifferent
to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) clever companion. It is agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to be walking there with
him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). I can see that from here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And in the excitement of observation
Felix rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) feet.

<p/>Gertrude rose also, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) made no attempt to emulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) companion's
discovery; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked rather in another direction. Felix's words had
struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>); but a certain delicacy checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is certainly not
indifferent to Mr. Brand; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has the highest opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can see it--one can see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, in a tone of amused
contemplation, with his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) head on one side. Gertrude turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) back to
the opposite shore; it was disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) to look, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) hoped
Felix would say something more. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, they have wandered away into the
wood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) added.

<p/>Gertrude turned round again. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is _not_ in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said;
it seemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) duty to say that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) ought to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is
such a perfect little woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) reminds me of a pair of
old-fashioned silver sugar-tongs; you know I am very fond of sugar. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is very nice with Mr. Brand; I have noticed that; very gentle and
gracious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude reflected a moment. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) took a great resolution. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) to marry me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``So of course she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix's eyebrows rose higher than ever. <div class="bookquote">``To marry you! Ah, ah, this is
interesting. And you think one must be very nice with a man to induce
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude had turned a little pale, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brand wants it
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix folded his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) arms and stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I see--I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said
quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Why did you never tell me this before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is disagreeable to me to speak of it even now. I wished simply to
explain to you about Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't wish to marry Mr. Brand, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And does your father wish it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--you have refused him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father and sister think you ought to, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a long story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``They think there are good reasons.
I can't explain it. They think I have obligations, and that I have
encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) an amusing story
about someone else. <div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you how this interests me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Now you don't recognize these reasons--these obligations?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure; it is not easy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) parasol and
turned away, as if to descend the slope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix went on, going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``are you likely to give
in--to let them persuade you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) with the serious face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had constantly
worn, in opposition to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) almost eager smile. <div class="bookquote">``I shall never marry Mr.
Brand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix rejoined. And they slowly descended the hill together,
saying nothing till they reached the margin of the pond. <div class="bookquote">``It is your own
affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) then resumed; <div class="bookquote">``but do you know, I am not altogether glad? If
it were settled that you were to marry Mr. Brand I should take a certain
comfort in the arrangement. I should feel more free. I have no right
to make love to you myself, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) paused, lightly pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
argument upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None whatever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>replied Gertrude quickly--too quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father would never hear of it; I haven't a penny. Mr. Brand, of
course, has property of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) own, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) has some property; but that has nothing to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With you, of course not; but with your father and sister it must have.
So, as I say, if this were settled, I should feel more at liberty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More at liberty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Please unfasten the boat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix untwisted the rope and stood holding it. <div class="bookquote">``I should be able to say
things to you that I can't give myself the pleasure of saying now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
went on. <div class="bookquote">``I could tell you how much I admire you, without seeming to
pretend to that which I have no right to pretend to. I should make
violent love to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) added, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``if I thought you were so
placed as not to be offended by it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean if I were engaged to another man? That is strange reasoning!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case you would not take me seriously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take everyone seriously,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. And without his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) help she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
stepped lightly into the boat.

<p/>Felix took up the oars and sent it forward. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, this is what you have
been thinking about? It seemed to me you had something on your mind.
I wish very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that you would tell me some of these
so-called reasons--these obligations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not real reasons--good reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, looking at the
pink and yellow gleams in the water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can understand that! Because a handsome girl has had a spark of
coquetry, that is no reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean me, it's not that. I have not done that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is something that troubles you, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so much as it used to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude rejoined.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), smiling always. <div class="bookquote">``That is not saying much, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
only rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) eyes, very gravely, on the lighted water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) seemed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to be trying to hide the signs of the trouble of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had just
told him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). Felix felt, at all times, much the same impulse to dissipate
visible melancholy that a good housewife feels to brush away dust. There
was something he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) wished to brush away now; suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) stopped rowing
and poised his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) oars. <div class="bookquote">``Why should Mr. Brand have addressed himself to
you, and not to your sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would listen to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) family, was thought capable of a good deal of levity;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) levity had never gone so far as this. It moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) greatly,
however, to hear Felix say that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was sure of something; so that,
raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) eyes toward him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) tried intently, for some moments, to
conjure up this wonderful image of a love-affair between her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own sister
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own suitor. We know that Gertrude had an imaginative mind; so
that it is not impossible that this effort should have been partially
successful. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) only murmured, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Felix! ah, Felix!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't they marry? Try and make them marry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try and make them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn the tables on them. Then they will leave you alone. I will help
you as far as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude's heart began to beat; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was greatly excited; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had never
had anything so interesting proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) before. Felix had begun to
row again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) now sent the boat home with long strokes. <div class="bookquote">``I believe
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) _does_ care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, after they had disembarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) does, and we will marry them off. It will make them
happy; it will make everyone happy. We shall have a wedding and I will
write an epithalamium.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems as if it would make _me_ happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To get rid of Mr. Brand, eh? To recover your liberty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude walked on. <div class="bookquote">``To see my sister married to so good a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix gave his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) light laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You always put things on those grounds; you
will never say anything for yourself. You are all so afraid, here, of
being selfish. I don't think you know how,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``Let me show
you! It will make me happy for myself, and for just the reverse of what
I told you a while ago. After that, when I make love to you, you will
have to think I mean it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never think you mean anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``You are too
fantastic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix, <div class="bookquote">``that's a license to say everything! Gertrude, I
adore you!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>Charlotte and Mr. Brand had not returned when they reached the house;
but the Baroness had come to tea, and Robert Acton also, who now
regularly asked for a place at this generous repast or made his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
appearance later in the evening. Clifford Wentworth, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) juvenile
growl, remarked upon it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are always coming to tea nowadays, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I should
think you had drunk enough tea in China.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since when is Mr. Acton more frequent?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford. <div class="bookquote">``It seems as if you were a kind of
attraction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am a curiosity,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``Give me time and I
will make you a salon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would fall to pieces after you go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Acton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) going, in that familiar way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford said. <div class="bookquote">``It
makes me feel gloomy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) son, and taking note of these words,
wondered if Felix had been teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), according to the programme he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
had sketched out, to make love to the wife of a German prince.

<p/>Charlotte came in late with Mr. Brand; but Gertrude, to whom, at least,
Felix had taught something, looked in vain, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) face, for the traces
of a guilty passion. Mr. Brand sat down by Gertrude, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) presently
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) why they had not crossed the pond to join Felix and herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is cruel of you to ask me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) answered, very softly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had a
large morsel of cake before him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) fingered it without eating it.
<div class="bookquote">``I sometimes think you are growing cruel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) added.

<p/>Gertrude said nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was afraid to speak. There was a kind of rage
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) heart; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) could easily persuade herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
was persecuted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said to herself that it was quite right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
should not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) thought
of what Felix had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) wished indeed Mr. Brand would marry
Charlotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) and spoke no more. Mr. Brand
ended by eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) cake, while Felix sat opposite, describing to
Mr. Wentworth the students' duels at Heidelberg. After tea they all
dispersed themselves, as usual, upon the piazza and in the garden; and
Mr. Brand drew near to Gertrude again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't come to you this afternoon because you were not alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
began; <div class="bookquote">``because you were with a newer friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Felix? He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is an old friend by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand looked at the ground for some moments. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I was
prepared to hear you speak in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) resumed. <div class="bookquote">``But I find it very
painful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what else I can say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/>Mr. Brand walked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) for a while in silence; Gertrude wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
would go away. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is certainly very accomplished. But I think I ought
to advise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To advise me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I know your nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, with a soft laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You make yourself out worse than you are--to please him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand
said, gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse--to please him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Gertrude, stopping.

<p/>Mr. Brand stopped also, and with the same soft straight-forwardness, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
doesn't care for the things you care for--the great questions of life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>), shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care for the
great questions of life. They are much beyond me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a time when you didn't say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>rejoined Gertrude, <div class="bookquote">``I think you made me talk a great deal of
nonsense. And it depends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``upon what you call the great
questions of life. There are some things I care for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they the things you talk about with your cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not say things to me against my cousin, Mr. Brand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said
Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``That is dishonorable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) listened to this respectfully; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) answered, with a little
vibration of the voice, <div class="bookquote">``I should be very sorry to do anything
dishonorable. But I don't see why it is dishonorable to say that your
cousin is frivolous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and say it to himself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would admit it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand. <div class="bookquote">``That is the tone he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would
take. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not be ashamed of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am not ashamed of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude declared. <div class="bookquote">``That is probably what
I like him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) for. I am frivolous myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are trying, as I said just now, to lower yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am trying for once to be natural!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>cried Gertrude passionately. <div class="bookquote">``I
have been pretending, all my life; I have been dishonest; it is you that
have made me so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand stood gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``Why
shouldn't I be frivolous, if I want? One has a right to be frivolous, if
it's one's nature. No, I don't care for the great questions. I care for
pleasure--for amusement. Perhaps I am fond of wicked things; it is very
possible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand remained staring; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was even a little pale, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had been
frightened. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you know what you are saying!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. Perhaps I am talking nonsense. But it is only with you
that I talk nonsense. I never do so with my cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will speak to you again, when you are less excited,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am always excited when you speak to me. I must tell you that--even if
it prevents you altogether, in future. Your speaking to me irritates me.
With my cousin it is very different. That seems quiet and natural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) looked away, with a kind of helpless
distress, at the dusky garden and the faint summer stars. After which,
suddenly turning back, <div class="bookquote">``Gertrude, Gertrude!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) softly groaned. <div class="bookquote">``Am I
really losing you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was touched--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was pained; but it had already occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) might do something better than say so. It would not have alleviated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) companion's distress to perceive, just then, whence she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had
sympathetically borrowed this ingenuity. <div class="bookquote">``I am not sorry for you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude said; <div class="bookquote">``for in paying so much attention to me you are following
a shadow--you are wasting something precious. There is something else
you might have that you don't look at--something better than I am. That
is a reality!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>And then, with intention, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) and tried
to smile a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) thought this smile of hers very strange; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
turned away and left him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wandered about alone in the garden wondering what Mr. Brand would
make of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) words, which it had been a singular pleasure for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) to
utter. Shortly after, passing in front of the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) saw at a
distance two persons standing near the garden gate. It was Mr. Brand
going away and bidding good-night to Charlotte, who had walked down with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) from the house. Gertrude saw that the parting was prolonged. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) back upon it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had not gone very far, however, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister slowly following her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) neither turned round nor
waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) knew what Charlotte was going to say. Charlotte, who
at last overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), in fact presently began; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arm
into Gertrude's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you listen to me, dear, if I say something very particular?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what you are going to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brand feels very
badly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gertrude, how can you treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte demanded. And as her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
sister made no answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``After all he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) has done for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) done for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you can ask, Gertrude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) has helped you so. You told me so
yourself, a great many times. You told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) helped you to struggle
with your--your peculiarities. You told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had taught you how to
govern your temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment Gertrude said nothing. Then, <div class="bookquote">``Was my temper very bad?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not accusing you, Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister demanded, with a short laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am pleading for Mr. Brand--reminding you of all you owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have given it all back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, still with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) little laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) can take back the virtue he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) imparted! I want to be wicked again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister made her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) stop in the path, and fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>), in the
darkness, a sweet, reproachful gaze. <div class="bookquote">``If you talk this way I shall
almost believe it. Think of all we owe Mr. Brand. Think of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) has
always expected something of you. Think how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) has been to us.
Think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) beautiful influence upon Clifford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is
very good. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) shouldn't speak against Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Felix is good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte answered, softly but promptly. <div class="bookquote">``Felix is very
wonderful. Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is so different. Mr. Brand is much nearer to us. I
should never think of going to Felix with a trouble--with a question.
Mr. Brand is much more to us, Gertrude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is very--very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude repeated. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is more to you; yes,
much more. Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) added suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``you are in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gertrude!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>cried poor Charlotte; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) blushing in
the darkness.

<p/>Gertrude put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) would marry you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) went
on.

<p/>Charlotte shook herself free. <div class="bookquote">``You must not say such things!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
exclaimed, beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) more than you say, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) likes you more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very cruel of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte/Charlotte Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Charlotte Wentworth murmured.

<p/>But if it was cruel Gertrude continued pitiless. <div class="bookquote">``Not if it's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
answered. <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) would marry you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister almost moaned.

<p/>``Yes, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) speaks to me again about myself. I will say, `Why don't you
marry Charlotte? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s a thousand times better than I.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You _are_ wicked; you _are_ changed!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't like it you can prevent it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``You can
prevent it by keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) from speaking to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And with this she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) walked
away, very conscious of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had done; measuring it and finding a
certain joy and a quickened sense of freedom in it.

<p/>Mr. Wentworth was rather wide of the mark in suspecting that Clifford
had begun to pay unscrupulous compliments to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) brilliant cousin; for
the young man had really more scruples than he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) received credit for in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) had a certain transparent shamefacedness which was
in itself a proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) was not at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) ease in dissipation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
collegiate peccadilloes had aroused a domestic murmur as disagreeable
to the young man as the creaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) boots would have been to a
house-breaker. Only, as the house-breaker would have simplified matters
by removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) _chaussures_, it had seemed to Clifford that the
shortest cut to comfortable relations with people--relations which
should make him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) cease to think that when they spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) they meant
something improving--was to renounce all ambition toward a nefarious
development. And, in fact, Clifford's ambition took the most commendable
form. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) thought of himself in the future as the well-known and
much-liked Mr. Wentworth, of Boston, who should, in the natural course
of prosperity, have married his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) pretty cousin, Lizzie Acton; should live
in a wide-fronted house, in view of the Common; and should drive, behind
a light wagon, over the damp autumn roads, a pair of beautifully matched
sorrel horses. Clifford's vision of the coming years was very simple;
its most definite features were this element of familiar matrimony and
the duplication of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) resources for trotting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) had not yet asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
cousin to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) meant to do so as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
degree. Lizzie was serenely conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) intention, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) had made
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) would improve. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) brother, who was very fond of
this light, quick, competent little Lizzie, saw on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) side no reason to
interpose. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a graceful social law that Clifford and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
sister should become engaged; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) himself was not engaged, but everyone
else, fortunately, was not such a fool as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was fond of Clifford,
as well, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) own way--of which it must be confessed he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) was a
little ashamed--of looking at those aberrations which had led to the
young man's compulsory retirement from the neighboring seat of learning.
Acton had seen the world, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been to China
and had knocked about among men. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learned the essential difference
between a nice young fellow and a mean young fellow, and was satisfied
that there was no harm in Clifford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) believed--although it must be
added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) had not quite the courage to declare it--in the doctrine
of wild oats, and thought it a useful preventive of superfluous fears.
If Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte and Mr. Brand would only apply it in
Clifford's case, they would be happier; and Acton thought it a pity
they should not be happier. They took the boy's misdemeanors too much to
heart; they talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) too solemnly; they frightened and bewildered
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Of course there was the great standard of morality, which forbade
that a man should get tipsy, play at billiards for money, or cultivate
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sensual consciousness; but what fear was there that poor Clifford
was going to run a tilt at any great standard? It had, however, never
occurred to Acton to dedicate the Baroness Münster to the redemption of
a refractory collegian. The instrument, here, would have seemed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) quite too complex for the operation. Felix, on the other hand, had
spoken in obedience to the belief that the more charming a woman is the
more numerous, literally, are her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) definite social uses.

<p/>Eugenia herself, as we know, had plenty of leisure to enumerate her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
uses. As I have had the honor of intimating, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had come four thousand
miles to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) fortune; and it is not to be supposed that after this
great effort she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) could neglect any apparent aid to advancement. It is
my misfortune that in attempting to describe in a short compass the
deportment of this remarkable woman I am obliged to express things
rather brutally. I feel this to be the case, for instance, when I say
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had primarily detected such an aid to advancement in the person
of Robert Acton, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had afterwards remembered that a
prudent archer has always a second bowstring. Eugenia was a woman of
finely-mingled motive, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) intentions were never sensibly gross.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had a sort of aesthetic ideal for Clifford which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) a
disinterested reason for taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) in hand. It was very well for a
fresh-colored young gentleman to be ingenuous; but Clifford, really, was
crude. With such a pretty face he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) ought to have prettier manners. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
would teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) that, with a beautiful name, the expectation of a large
property, and, as they said in Europe, a social position, an only son
should know how to carry himself.

<p/>Once Clifford had begun to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) by himself and for himself,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) came very often. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) hardly knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) should come; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) almost
every evening at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) father's house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) had nothing particular to say to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) was not a young girl, and fellows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) age called only upon
young girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) exaggerated her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) age; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) an old woman; it
was happy that the Baroness, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) intelligence, was incapable of
guessing this. But gradually it struck Clifford that visiting old women
might be, if not a natural, at least, as they say of some articles of
diet, an acquired taste. The Baroness was certainly a very amusing old
woman; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) as no lady--and indeed no gentleman--had ever
talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should go to Europe and make the tour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) one
afternoon. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, on leaving college you will go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford declared. <div class="bookquote">``I know some fellows who have
been to Europe. They say you can have better fun here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends. It depends upon your idea of fun. Your friends probably
were not introduced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Introduced?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They had no opportunity of going into society; they formed no
_relations_.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>This was one of a certain number of words that the
Baroness often pronounced in the French manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They went to a ball, in Paris; I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there are balls and balls; especially in Paris. No, you must go,
you know; it is not a thing from which you can dispense yourself. You
need it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not sick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean for your health, my poor child. I mean for your manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't got any manners!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>growled Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely. You don't mind my assenting to that, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness
with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``You must go to Europe and get a few. You can get them
better there. It is a pity you might not have come while I was living
in--in Germany. I would have introduced you; I had a charming little
circle. You would perhaps have been rather young; but the younger one
begins, I think, the better. Now, at any rate, you have no time to lose,
and when I return you must immediately come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>All this, to Clifford's apprehension, was a great mixture--his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) beginning
young, Eugenia's return to Europe, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) being introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) charming
little circle. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) to begin, and what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) little circle? His (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
ideas about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) marriage had a good deal of vagueness; but they were
in so far definite as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) felt it to be a matter not to be freely
mentioned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) sat and looked all round the room; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) was
alluding in some way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't want to go to Germany,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) said; it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) the most
convenient thing to say.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) a while, smiling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) lips, but not with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have scruples?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scruples?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You young people, here, are very singular; one doesn't know where to
expect you. When you are not extremely improper you are so terribly
proper. I dare say you think that, owing to my irregular marriage, I
live with loose people. You were never more mistaken. I have been all
the more particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford, honestly distressed. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought such a
thing as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very sure? I am convinced that your father does, and your
sisters. They say to each other that here I am on my good behavior,
but that over there--married by the left hand--I associate with light
women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>cried Clifford, energetically, <div class="bookquote">``they don't say such things as
that to each other!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If they think them they had better say them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness rejoined.
<div class="bookquote">``Then they can be contradicted. Please contradict that whenever you hear
it, and don't be afraid of coming to see me on account of the company I
keep. I have the honor of knowing more distinguished men, my poor child,
than you are likely to see in a life-time. I see very few women; but
those are women of rank. So, my dear young Puritan, you needn't be
afraid. I am not in the least one of those who think that the society of
women who have lost their place in the _vrai monde_ is necessary to form
a young man. I have never taken that tone. I have kept my place myself,
and I think we are a much better school than the others. Trust me,
Clifford, and I will prove that to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness continued, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) made the agreeable reflection that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) could not, at least, be
accused of perverting her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) young kinsman. <div class="bookquote">``So if you ever fall among
thieves don't go about saying I sent you to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Clifford thought it so comical that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) should know--in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
figurative language--what she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) meant, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) should mean what he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
knew, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) could hardly help laughing a little, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) tried
hard. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laugh out, laugh out, if I amuse you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>cried the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``I am here
for that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>And Clifford thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) a very amusing person indeed.
<div class="bookquote">``But remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said on this occasion, <div class="bookquote">``that you are coming--next
year--to pay me a visit over there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>About a week afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>), point-blank, <div class="bookquote">``Are you seriously
making love to your little cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seriously making love'' (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>--these words, on Madame Münster's lips, had to
Clifford's sense a portentous and embarrassing sound; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) hesitated about
assenting, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) should commit himself to more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) understood.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I shouldn't say it if I was!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why wouldn't you say it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>the Baroness demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Those things ought to
be known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care whether it is known or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``But I
don't want people looking at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A young man of your importance ought to learn to bear observation--to
carry himself as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were quite indifferent to it. I won't say,
exactly, unconscious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness explained. <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must seem to know
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is observed, and to think it natural he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must appear
perfectly used to it. Now you haven't that, Clifford; you haven't that
at all. You must have that, you know. Don't tell me you are not a young
man of importance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Eugenia added. <div class="bookquote">``Don't say anything so flat as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, you don't catch me saying that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>cried Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you must come to Germany,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Münster continued. <div class="bookquote">``I will show
you how people can be talked about, and yet not seem to know it. You
will be talked about, of course, with me; it will be said you are my
lover. I will show you how little one may mind that--how little I shall
mind it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Clifford sat staring, blushing and laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I shall mind it a good
deal!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, not too much, you know; that would be uncivil. But I give you leave
to mind it a little; especially if you have a passion for Miss Acton.
_Voyons_; as regards that, you either have or you have not. It is very
simple to say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why you want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to want me to know. If one is arranging a marriage, one tells
one's friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not arranging anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't intend to marry your cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I expect I shall do as I choose!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Baroness</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) head upon the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) chair and closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
eyes, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) were tired. Then opening them again, <div class="bookquote">``Your cousin is
very charming!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is the prettiest girl in this place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford rejoined.

<p/>```In this place' is saying little; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) would be charming anywhere. I am
afraid you are entangled.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, I'm not entangled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you engaged? At your age that is the same thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Clifford looked at the Baroness with some audacity. <div class="bookquote">``Will you tell no
one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it's as sacred as that--no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then--we are not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the great secret--that you are not, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness,
with a quick laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to hear it. You are altogether too
young. A young man in your position must choose and compare; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must see
the world first. Depend upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``you should not settle that
matter before you have come abroad and paid me that visit. There are
several things I should like to call your attention to first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am rather afraid of that visit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me
it will be rather like going to school again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Baroness</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there is no agreeable man who has not, at
some moment, been to school to a clever woman--probably a little older
than himself. And you must be thankful when you get your instructions
gratis. With me you would get it gratis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day Clifford told Lizzie Acton that the Baroness thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
the most charming girl she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had ever seen.

<p/>Lizzie shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think everything she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Clifford, <div class="bookquote">``is to be taken the
opposite way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Lizzie.

<p/>Clifford was going to remark that in this case the Baroness must desire
greatly to bring about a marriage between Mr. Clifford Wentworth and
Miss Elizabeth Acton; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) resolved, on the whole, to suppress this
observation.



<p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>It seemed to Robert Acton, after Eugenia had come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) house, that
something had passed between them which made them a good deal more
intimate. It was hard to say exactly what, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) resolution with regard to the Prince Adolf; for Madame
Münster's visit had made no difference in their relations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) came to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) very often; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) very often before. It was
agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to find himself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) little drawing-room; but this
was not a new discovery. There was a change, however, in this sense:
that if the Baroness had been a great deal in Acton's thoughts before,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was now never out of them. From the first she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had been personally
fascinating; but the fascination now had become intellectual as well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
was constantly pondering her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) words and motions; they were as interesting
as the factors in an algebraic problem. This is saying a good deal; for
Acton was extremely fond of mathematics. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) asked himself whether it
could be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), and then hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was not; hoped
it not so much for his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own sake as for that of the amatory passion
itself. If this was love, love had been overrated. Love was a poetic
impulse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own state of feeling with regard to the Baroness was
largely characterized by that eminently prosaic sentiment--curiosity.
It was true, as Acton with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) quietly cogitative habit observed
to himself, that curiosity, pushed to a given point, might become a
romantic passion; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) certainly thought enough about this charming
woman to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) restless and even a little melancholy. It puzzled and
vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) at times to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was not more ardent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was not in
the least bent upon remaining a bachelor. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) younger years he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
been--or he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had tried to be--of the opinion that it would be a good deal
<div class="bookquote">``jollier''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>not to marry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had flattered himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) single
condition was something of a citadel. It was a citadel, at all events,
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had long since leveled the outworks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had removed the guns
from the ramparts; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had lowered the draw-bridge across the moat. The
draw-bridge had swayed lightly under Madame Münster's step; why should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) not cause it to be raised again, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might be kept prisoner?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had an idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would become--in time at least, and on learning
the conveniences of the place for making a lady comfortable--a tolerably
patient captive. But the draw-bridge was never raised, and Acton's
brilliant visitor was as free to depart as she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had been to come. It was
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) curiosity to know why the deuce so susceptible a man was
_not_ in love with so charming a woman. If her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) various graces were, as
I have said, the factors in an algebraic problem, the answer to this
question was the indispensable unknown quantity. The pursuit of the
unknown quantity was extremely absorbing; for the present it taxed all
Acton's faculties.

<p/>Toward the middle of August he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obliged to leave home for some days;
an old friend, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been associated in China, had begged him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
to come to Newport, where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lay extremely ill. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) friend got better,
and at the end of a week Acton was released. I use the word <div class="bookquote">``released''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>advisedly; for in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) attachment to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) Chinese comrade he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
been but a half-hearted visitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been called away
from the theatre during the progress of a remarkably interesting drama.
The curtain was up all this time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was losing the fourth act; that
fourth act which would have been so essential to a just appreciation of
the fifth. In other words, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was thinking about the Baroness, who, seen
at this distance, seemed a truly brilliant figure. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw at Newport
a great many pretty women, who certainly were figures as brilliant as
beautiful light dresses could make them; but though they talked a
great deal--and the Baroness's strong point was perhaps also her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
conversation--Madame Münster appeared to lose nothing by the comparison.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had come to Newport too. Would it not be possible to make
up, as they said, a party for visiting the famous watering-place and
invite Eugenia to join it? It was true that the complete satisfaction
would be to spend a fortnight at Newport with Eugenia alone. It would be
a great pleasure to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>), in society, carry everything before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>),
as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) would do. When Acton caught himself thinking these
thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) began to walk up and down, with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pockets,
frowning a little and looking at the floor. What did it prove--for
it certainly proved something--this lively disposition to be <div class="bookquote">``off''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>somewhere with Madame Münster, away from all the rest of them? Such a
vision, certainly, seemed a refined implication of matrimony, after the
Baroness should have formally got rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) informal husband. At
any rate, Acton, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) characteristic discretion, forbore to give
expression to whatever else it might imply, and the narrator of these
incidents is not obliged to be more definite.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) returned home rapidly, and, arriving in the afternoon, lost as little
time as possible in joining the familiar circle at Mr. Wentworth's. On
reaching the house, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) found the piazzas empty. The doors and
windows were open, and their emptiness was made clear by the shafts of
lamp-light from the parlors. Entering the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) found Mr. Wentworth
sitting alone in one of these apartments, engaged in the perusal of
the _North American Review_. After they had exchanged greetings and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
cousin had made discreet inquiry about his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) journey, Acton asked what had
become of Mr. Wentworth's companions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are scattered about, amusing themselves as usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old
man. <div class="bookquote">``I saw Charlotte, a short time since, seated, with Mr. Brand,
upon the piazza. They were conversing with their customary animation.
I suppose they have joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister, who, for the hundredth time, was
doing the honors of the garden to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) foreign cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you mean Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton. And on Mr. Wentworth's
assenting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``And the others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister has not come this evening. You must have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) at home,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to come. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) declined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizzie, I suppose, was expecting a visitor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, with a
kind of solemn slyness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) was expecting Clifford, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) had not turned up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth, at this intelligence, closed the _North American Review_
and remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had understood Clifford to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) was going to
see his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) cousin. Privately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) reflected that if Lizzie Acton had had no
news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) son, Clifford must have gone to Boston for the evening: an
unnatural course of a summer night, especially when accompanied with
disingenuous representations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) has two cousins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, laughing. And
then, coming to the point, <div class="bookquote">``If Lizzie is not here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``neither
apparently is the Baroness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wentworth stared a moment, and remembered that queer proposition of
Felix's. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did not know whether it was not to be wished
that Clifford, after all, might have gone to Boston. <div class="bookquote">``The Baroness
has not honored us tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) has not come over for three
days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I have been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, <div class="bookquote">``I infer she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) has tired of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton pretended to sit down, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was restless; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) found it impossible
to talk with Mr. Wentworth. At the end of ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hat
and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``go off.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was very late; it was ten
o’clock.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) quiet-faced kinsman looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
asked.

<p/>Acton hesitated, and then answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had proposed to go over and
take a look at the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are honest, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So are you, if you come to that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>cried Acton, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't
I be honest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man opened the _North American_ again, and read a few lines.
<div class="bookquote">``If we have ever had any virtue among us, we had better keep hold of it
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was not quoting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have a Baroness among us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton. <div class="bookquote">``That's what we must keep
hold of!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was too impatient to see Madame Münster again to wonder
what Mr. Wentworth was talking about. Nevertheless, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had passed
out of the house and traversed the garden and the little piece of road
that separated him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) from Eugenia's provisional residence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) stopped a
moment outside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) little garden; the long window of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) parlor was open, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could see the white curtains, with the
lamp-light shining through them, swaying softly to and fro in the warm
night wind. There was a sort of excitement in the idea of seeing Madame
Münster again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) became aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) heart was beating rather faster
than usual. It was this that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) stop, with a half-amused surprise.
But in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) went along the piazza, and, approaching the open
window, tapped upon its lintel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) stick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could see the Baroness
within; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was standing in the middle of the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) came to the
window and pulled aside the curtain; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) a
moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was not smiling; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) seemed serious.

<p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Mais entrez donc!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said at last. Acton passed in across the
window-sill; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wondered, for an instant, what was the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>).
But the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had begun to smile and had put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Better late than never,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is very kind of you to come at
this hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just returned from my journey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, very kind, very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) repeated, looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) where to
sit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went first to the other house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton continued. <div class="bookquote">``I expected to find
you there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had sunk into her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) usual chair; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) got up again, and began
to move about the room. Acton had laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hat and stick; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), conscious that there was in fact a great charm in seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether I ought to tell you to sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``It is too late to begin a visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too early to end one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton declared; <div class="bookquote">``and we needn't mind the
beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) again, and, after a moment, dropped once more into her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
low chair, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) took a place near her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We are in the middle, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Was that where we were when you went away? No, I haven't
been to the other house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yesterday, nor the day before, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how many days it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are tired of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) leaned back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) chair; her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) arms were folded. <div class="bookquote">``That is a terrible
accusation, but I have not the courage to defend myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not attacking you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton. <div class="bookquote">``I expected something of this
kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a proof of extreme intelligence. I hope you enjoyed your journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton declared. <div class="bookquote">``I would much rather have been here with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you _are_ attacking me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``You are contrasting my
inconstancy with your own fidelity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess I never get tired of people I like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are not a poor wicked foreign woman, with irritable nerves and
a sophisticated mind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something has happened to you since I went away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, changing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your going away--that is what has happened to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say that you have missed me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had meant to say it, it would not be worth your making a note of.
I am very dishonest and my compliments are worthless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton was silent for some moments. <div class="bookquote">``You have broken down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said at
last.

<p/>Madame Münster left her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) chair, and began to move about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only for a moment. I shall pull myself together again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better not take it too hard. If you are bored, you needn't be
afraid to say so--to me at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't say such things as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness answered. <div class="bookquote">``You
should encourage me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I admire your patience; that is encouraging.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't even say that. When you talk of my patience you are
disloyal to your own people. Patience implies suffering; and what have I
had to suffer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not hunger, not unkindness, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, laughing.
<div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, we all admire your patience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You all detest me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>cried the Baroness, with a sudden vehemence,
turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) back toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You make it hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, getting up, <div class="bookquote">``for a man to say something
tender to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>This evening there was something particularly striking
and touching about her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>); an unwonted softness and a look of suppressed
emotion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) felt himself suddenly appreciating the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had
behaved very well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had come to this quiet corner of the world
under the weight of a cruel indignity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had been so gracefully,
modestly thankful for the rest she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) found there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had joined that
simple circle over the way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had mingled in its plain, provincial
talk; she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had shared its meagre and savorless pleasures. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had set
herself a task, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had rigidly performed it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had conformed to
the angular conditions of New England life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had had the tact and
pluck to carry it off as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) liked them. Acton felt a more downright
need than he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had ever felt before to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) as a very superior woman. All along, hitherto,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had been on his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) guard with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had been cautious, observant,
suspicious. But now a certain light tumult in his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) blood seemed to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) that a finer degree of confidence in this charming woman would be
its own reward. <div class="bookquote">``We don't detest you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what
you mean. At any rate, I speak for myself; I don't know anything about
the others. Very likely, you detest them for the dull life they make you
lead. Really, it would give me a sort of pleasure to hear you say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia had been looking at the door on the other side of the room;
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) slowly turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) eyes toward Robert Acton. <div class="bookquote">``What can be
the motive,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``of a man like you--an honest man, a _galant
homme_--in saying so base a thing as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it sound very base?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>asked Acton, candidly. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it
does, and I thank you for telling me so. Of course, I don't mean it
literally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How do you mean it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) asked.

<p/>This question was difficult to answer, and Acton, feeling the least
bit foolish, walked to the open window and looked out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) stood there,
thinking a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) turned back. <div class="bookquote">``You know that document
that you were to send to Germany,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You called it your
`renunciation.' Did you ever send it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Münster's eyes expanded; she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) looked very grave. <div class="bookquote">``What a singular
answer to my question!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it isn't an answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton. <div class="bookquote">``I have wished to ask you, many
times. I thought it probable you would tell me yourself. The question,
on my part, seems abrupt now; but it would be abrupt at any time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness was silent a moment; and then, <div class="bookquote">``I think I have told you too
much!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said.

<p/>This declaration appeared to Acton to have a certain force; he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had
indeed a sense of asking more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) returned
to the window, and watched, for a moment, a little star that twinkled
through the lattice of the piazza. There were at any rate offers enough
he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) could make; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had hitherto not been sufficiently explicit in
doing so. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would ask something of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) presently said. <div class="bookquote">``Is
there nothing I can do for you? If you can't stand this dull life any
more, let me amuse you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness had sunk once more into a chair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had taken up a fan
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) held, with both hands, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) mouth. Over the top of the fan
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) eyes were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are very strange tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said,
with a little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do anything in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) rejoined, standing in front
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't you like to travel about and see something of the
country? Won't you go to Niagara? You ought to see Niagara, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With you, do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be delighted to take you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), smiling, and yet with a serious air. <div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; we
might go alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were not what you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I should feel insulted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean--what I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were one of the gentlemen I have been used to all my life. If
you were not a queer Bostonian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If the gentlemen you have been used to have taught you to expect
insults,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad I am what I am. You had much better
come to Niagara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you wish to `amuse' me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness declared, <div class="bookquote">``you need go to no
further expense. You amuse me very effectually.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) sat down opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) still held her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) fan up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) face, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) eyes only showing above it. There was a moment's silence, and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) said, returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) former question, <div class="bookquote">``Have you sent that document
to Germany?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again there was a moment's silence. The expressive eyes of Madame
Münster seemed, however, half to break it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you--at Niagara!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had hardly spoken when the door at the further end of the room
opened--the door upon which, some minutes previous, Eugenia had fixed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) gaze. Clifford Wentworth stood there, blushing and looking rather
awkward. The Baroness rose, quickly, and Acton, more slowly, did the
same. Clifford gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) no greeting; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) was looking at Eugenia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you were here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Acton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was in Felix's studio,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame Münster. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wanted to see his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
sketches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Clifford looked at Robert Acton, but said nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) only fanned
himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``You chose a bad moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton; <div class="bookquote">``you hadn't
much light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't any!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your candle went out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Eugenia asked. <div class="bookquote">``You should have come back here
and lighted it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Clifford looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``So I have--come back. But I have left
the candle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia turned away. <div class="bookquote">``You are very stupid, my poor boy. You had better
go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford, <div class="bookquote">``good-night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you a word to throw to a man when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has safely returned from a
dangerous journey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford. <div class="bookquote">``I thought--I thought you were--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) paused, looking at the Baroness again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought I was at Newport, eh? So I was--this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, clever child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame Münster, over her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>Clifford stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)--not at all like a clever child; and then, with
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) little facetious growls, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>asked Acton, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) was gone. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed
rather in a muddle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia, who was near the window, glanced out, listening a moment. <div class="bookquote">``The
matter--the matter'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``But you don't say such things here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been drinking a little, you can say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't drink any more. I have cured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And in return--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s in
love with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Acton's turn to stare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) instantly thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) sister; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) said nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) began to laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
passion! But I wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forsaking your society for that of your
brother's paint-brushes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia was silent a little. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been in the studio. I invented
that at the moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Invented it? For what purpose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has an idea of being romantic. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has adopted the habit of coming to
see me at midnight--passing only through the orchard and through Felix's
painting-room, which has a door opening that way. It seems to amuse
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>added Eugenia, with a little laugh.

<p/>Acton felt more surprise than he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) confessed to, for this was a new view
of Clifford, whose irregularities had hitherto been quite without
the romantic element. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) tried to laugh again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) felt rather too
serious, and after a moment's hesitation his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) seriousness explained
itself. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you don't encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must not be
inconstant to poor Lizzie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To your sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know they are decidedly intimate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>cried Eugenia, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``has she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--has she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Acton interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has. But I always supposed
that Clifford had a desire to make himself agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, _par exemple!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the Baroness went on. <div class="bookquote">``The little monster! The next
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) becomes sentimental I will him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) tell that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) ought to be ashamed
of himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``You had better say nothing about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) as much already, on general grounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness.
<div class="bookquote">``But in this country, you know, the relations of young people are so
extraordinary that one is quite at sea. They are not engaged when
you would quite say they ought to be. Take Charlotte Wentworth, for
instance, and that young ecclesiastic. If I were her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) father I should
insist upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); but it appears to be thought there is no
urgency. On the other hand, you suddenly learn that a boy of twenty
and a little girl who is still with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) governess--your sister has no
governess? Well, then, who is never away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mamma--a young couple,
in short, between whom you have noticed nothing beyond an exchange of
the childish pleasantries characteristic of their age, are on the
point of setting up as man and wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Baroness</b></font>)</div>The Baroness spoke with a certain
exaggerated volubility which was in contrast with the languid grace that
had characterized her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) manner before Clifford made his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) appearance. It
seemed to Acton that there was a spark of irritation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) eye--a note
of irony -LRB-as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) spoke of Lizzie being never away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) mother-RRB-
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) voice. If Madame Münster was irritated, Robert Acton was vaguely
mystified; she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) began to move about the room again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
without saying anything. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) watch, and, glancing
at it, declared that it was three o’clock in the morning and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
must go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not been here an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and they are still sitting up
at the other house. You can see the lights. Your brother has not come
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, at the other house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>cried Eugenia, <div class="bookquote">``they are terrible people!
I don't know what they may do over there. I am a quiet little humdrum
woman; I have rigid rules and I keep them. One of them is not to
have visitors in the small hours--especially clever men like you. So
good-night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Decidedly, the Baroness was incisive; and though Acton bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
good-night and departed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was still a good deal mystified.

<p/>The next day Clifford Wentworth came to see Lizzie, and Acton, who
was at home and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) pass through the garden, took note of the
circumstance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had a natural desire to make it tally with Madame
Münster's account of Clifford's disaffection; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) ingenuity, finding
itself unequal to the task, resolved at last to ask help of the young
man's candor. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going away, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went out
and overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the grounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish very much you would answer me a question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton said. <div class="bookquote">``What
were you doing, last night, at Madame Münster's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Clifford began to laugh and to blush, by no means like a young man with
a romantic secret. <div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I don't want to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I want to tell you the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford; <div class="bookquote">``and unless I know
it perhaps I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>They had stopped in a garden path; Acton looked hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) rosy
young kinsman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) couldn't fancy what had got into you; you
appeared to have taken a violent dislike to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Clifford stared, looking a little alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) growled, <div class="bookquote">``you
don't mean that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that when--for common civility's sake--you came occasionally to the
house you left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) alone and spent your time in Felix's studio, under
pretext of looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sketches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>growled Clifford, again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever know me to tell an untruth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, lots of them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford, seeing an opening, out of the
discussion, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) sarcastic powers. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) presently added, <div class="bookquote">``I
thought you were my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew someone was there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We heard you coming in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton meditated. <div class="bookquote">``You had been with the Baroness, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was in the parlor. We heard your step outside. I thought it was my
father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And on that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>asked Acton, <div class="bookquote">``you ran away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) told me to go--to go out by the studio.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton meditated more intensely; if there had been a chair at hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)
would have sat down. <div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) wish you not to meet your father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford, <div class="bookquote">``father doesn't like to see me there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton looked askance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) companion and forbore to make any comment
upon this assertion. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``to the Baroness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hasn't said so--in so many
words--to me. But I know it worries him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and I want to stop worrying
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The Baroness knows it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) wants me to stop, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To stop coming to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that; but to stop worrying father. Eugenia knows
everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford added, with an air of knowingness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, interrogatively, <div class="bookquote">``Eugenia knows everything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) knew it was not father coming in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Clifford blushed and laughed afresh. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I was afraid it was. And
besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) told me to go, at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) think it was I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) didn't say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert Acton/Robert</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Robert Acton reflected. <div class="bookquote">``But you didn't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) presently said;
<div class="bookquote">``you came back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't get out of the studio,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``The door was
locked, and Felix has nailed some planks across the lower half of the
confounded windows to make the light come in from above. So they were no
use. I waited there a good while, and then, suddenly, I felt ashamed.
I didn't want to be hiding away from my own father. I couldn't stand
it any longer. I bolted out, and when I found it was you I was a little
flurried. But Eugenia carried it off, didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Clifford added, in
the tone of a young humorist whose perception had not been permanently
clouded by the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) own discomfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautifully!''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton. <div class="bookquote">``Especially,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``when one
remembers that you were very imprudent and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) must have been a
good deal annoyed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>cried Clifford, with the indifference of a young man who feels
that however he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) may have failed of felicity in behavior he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) is extremely
just in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) impressions, <div class="bookquote">``Eugenia doesn't care for anything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you for telling me this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) said at
last. And then, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) hand on Clifford's shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me one thing more: are you by chance a little in love with the
Baroness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford, almost shaking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) hand.



<p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>The first sunday that followed Robert Acton's return from Newport
witnessed a change in the brilliant weather that had long prevailed. The
rain began to fall and the day was cold and dreary. Mr. Wentworth and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughters put on overshoes and went to church, and Felix Young,
without overshoes, went also, holding an umbrella over Gertrude. It is
to be feared that, in the whole observance, this was the privilege he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
most highly valued. The Baroness remained at home; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was in neither a
cheerful nor a devotional mood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had, however, never been, during her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
residence in the United States, what is called a regular attendant at
divine service; and on this particular Sunday morning of which I began
with speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) stood at the window of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) little drawing-room,
watching the long arm of a rose tree that was attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) piazza,
but a portion of which had disengaged itself, sway to and fro, shake and
gesticulate, against the dusky drizzle of the sky. Every now and then,
in a gust of wind, the rose tree scattered a shower of water-drops
against the window-pane; it appeared to have a kind of human movement--a
menacing, warning intention. The room was very cold; Madame Münster put
on a shawl and walked about. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) determined to have some fire; and
summoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ancient negress, the contrast of whose polished ebony and
whose crimson turban had been at first a source of satisfaction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) made arrangements for the production of a crackling flame. This old
woman's name was Azarina. The Baroness had begun by thinking that there
would be a savory wildness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) talk, and, for amusement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
had encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) to chatter. But Azarina was dry and prim; her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
conversation was anything but African; she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) reminded Eugenia of the
tiresome old ladies she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) met in society. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) knew, however, how to make
a fire; so that after she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had laid the logs, Eugenia, who was terribly
bored, found a quarter of an hour's entertainment in sitting and
watching them blaze and sputter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had thought it very likely
Robert Acton would come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had not met him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) since that
infelicitous evening. But the morning waned without his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) coming; several
times she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) step on the piazza; but it was only a
window-shutter shaking in a rain-gust. The Baroness, since the beginning
of that episode in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) career of which a slight sketch has been
attempted in these pages, had had many moments of irritation. But today
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) irritation had a peculiar keenness; it appeared to feed upon
itself. It urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) to do something; but it suggested no particularly
profitable line of action. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) could have done something at the
moment, on the spot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) would have stepped upon a European steamer and
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) back, with a kind of rapture, upon that profoundly mortifying
failure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) American relations. It is not exactly apparent
why she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) should have termed this enterprise a failure, inasmuch as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
had been treated with the highest distinction for which allowance had
been made in American institutions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) irritation came, at bottom, from
the sense, which, always present, had suddenly grown acute, that the
social soil on this big, vague continent was somehow not adapted for
growing those plants whose fragrance she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) especially inclined to
inhale and by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) liked to see herself surrounded--a species of
vegetation for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) carried a collection of seedlings, as we
may say, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) pocket. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) chief happiness in the sense of
exerting a certain power and making a certain impression; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
felt the annoyance of a rather wearied swimmer who, on nearing shore,
to land, finds a smooth straight wall of rock when he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) had counted upon
a clean firm beach. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) power, in the American air, seemed to have lost
its prehensile attributes; the smooth wall of rock was insurmountable.
_<div class="bookquote">``Surely je n’en suis pas là,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``that I let it
make me uncomfortable that a Mr. Robert Acton shouldn't honor me with a
visit!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was vexed that he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) had not come; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was vexed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
vexation.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother, at least, came in, stamping in the hall and shaking the wet
from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) coat. In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) entered the room, with a glow in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cheek
and half-a-dozen rain-drops glistening on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) moustache. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have a
fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said.

<p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Les beaux jours sont passés,'' (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>_ replied the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, never! They have only begun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix declared, planting himself
before the hearth. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) back to the fire, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hands
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), extended his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) legs and looked away through the window with an
expression of face which seemed to denote the perception of rose-color
even in the tints of a wet Sunday.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) chair, looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), watching him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); and what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face was not grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) present mood. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was puzzled
by many things, but her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother's disposition was a frequent source
of wonder to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). I say frequent and not constant, for there were long
periods during which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) attention to other problems. Sometimes
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had said to herself that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) happy temper, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eternal gaiety, was
an affectation, a _pose_; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was vaguely conscious that during the
present summer he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been a highly successful comedian. They had never
yet had an explanation; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had not known the need of one. Felix was
presumably following the bent of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) disinterested genius, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had no advice to give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would understand. With this,
there was always a certain element of comfort about Felix--the assurance
that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would not interfere. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was very delicate, this pure-minded
Felix; in effect, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) brother, and Madame Münster felt that there
was a great propriety, every way, in that. It is true that Felix was
delicate; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not fond of explanations with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister; this was one
of the very few things in the world about which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was uncomfortable.
But now he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not thinking of anything uncomfortable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia at last, <div class="bookquote">``do stop making _les yeux doux_ at
the rain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure. I will make them at you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>answered Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>asked Eugenia, in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``do you propose to remain
in this lovely spot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix stared. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want to go away--already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Already' is delicious. I am not so happy as you.''

<p/>Felix dropped into a chair, looking at the fire. <div class="bookquote">``The fact is I _am_
happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) light, clear tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you propose to spend your life in making love to Gertrude
Wentworth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, smiling sidewise at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister.

<p/>The Baroness returned his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) glance, much more gravely; and then, <div class="bookquote">``Do you
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix demanded.

<p/>The Baroness was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I will answer you in the words of the
gentleman who was asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) liked music: _`Je ne la crains pas!'_''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) admires you immensely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care for that. Other women should not admire one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They should dislike you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Madame Münster hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``They should hate me! It's a measure of
the time I have been losing here that they don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No time is lost in which one has been happy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, with a bright
sententiousness which may well have been a little irritating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And in which,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>rejoined his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, with a harsher laugh, <div class="bookquote">``one has
secured the affections of a young lady with a fortune!''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix explained, very candidly and seriously. <div class="bookquote">``I have secured Gertrude's
affection, but I am by no means sure that I have secured her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) fortune.
That may come--or it may not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, it _may!_ That's the great point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It depends upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't smile upon our union. You know
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) to marry Mr. Brand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>cried the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``Please to put on a log.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix complied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) request and sat watching the quickening of
the flame. Presently his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister added, <div class="bookquote">``And you propose to elope with
mademoiselle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means. I don't wish to do anything that's disagreeable to Mr.
Wentworth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) has been far too kind to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must choose between pleasing yourself and pleasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to please everyone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Felix, joyously. <div class="bookquote">``I have a good
conscience. I made up my mind at the outset that it was not my place to
make love to Gertrude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So, to simplify matters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) made love to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister with sudden gravity. <div class="bookquote">``You say you are not
afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps you ought to be--a little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)'s a
very clever person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to see it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>cried the Baroness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) brother, making no
rejoinder, leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) chair, and there was a long silence. At
last, with an altered accent, Madame Münster put another question. <div class="bookquote">``You
expect, at any rate, to marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be greatly disappointed if we don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A disappointment or two will do you good!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>the Baroness declared. <div class="bookquote">``And,
afterwards, do you mean to turn American?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me I am a very good American already. But we shall go to
Europe. Gertrude wants extremely to see the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, like me, when I came here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, with a little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix rejoined, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister with a certain
gentle seriousness. While he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) chair, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) also got up. <div class="bookquote">``Gertrude is not at all like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``but in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) own way she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) is almost as clever.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) paused a moment; his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) soul was
full of an agreeable feeling and of a lively disposition to express it.
His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spiritual vision, was always like the lunar disk when
only a part of it is lighted. The shadow on this bright surface seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to expand and to contract; but whatever its proportions, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
always appreciated the moonlight. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) looked at the Baroness, and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am very much in love with Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said. Eugenia
turned away and walked about the room, and Felix continued. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) is very
interesting, and very different from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) seems. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) has never had
a chance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) is very brilliant. We will go to Europe and amuse
ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness had gone to the window, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) stood looking out. The
day was drearier than ever; the rain was doggedly falling. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, to
amuse yourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``you had decidedly better go to
Europe!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) turned round, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother. A chair stood
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) hands upon the back of it. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think it
is very good of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``to come all this way with you simply to
see you properly married--if properly it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it will be properly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix, with light eagerness.

<p/>The Baroness gave a little laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You are thinking only of yourself,
and you don't answer my question. While you are amusing yourself--with
the brilliant Gertrude--what shall I be doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>_<div class="bookquote">``Vous serez de la partie!'' (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>_ cried Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you: I should spoil it.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Baroness</b></font>)</div>The Baroness dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) eyes for some
moments. <div class="bookquote">``Do you propose, however, to leave me here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) inquired.

<p/>Felix smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My dearest sister, where you are concerned I never
propose. I execute your commands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia, slowly, <div class="bookquote">``that you are the most heartless
person living. Don't you see that I am in trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw that you were not cheerful, and I gave you some good news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let me give you some news,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``You probably will
not have discovered it for yourself. Robert Acton wants to marry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I had not discovered that. But I quite understand it. Why does it
make you unhappy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I can't decide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix, joyously. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) is the best fellow
in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) is immensely in love with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) has a large fortune. Permit me in turn to remind you of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am perfectly aware of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia. <div class="bookquote">``That's a great item in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) favor. I am terribly candid.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) place and came nearer
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) brother, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was turning over several things;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was wondering in what manner he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) really understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>).

<p/>There were several ways of understanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>): there was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said,
and there was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) meant, and there was something, between the two,
that was neither. It is probable that, in the last analysis, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
meant was that Felix should spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) the necessity of stating the case
more exactly and should hold himself commissioned to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) by all
honorable means to marry the best fellow in the world. But in all this
it was never discovered what Felix understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once you have your liberty, what are your objections?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't particularly like him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, try a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am trying now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia. <div class="bookquote">``I should succeed better if he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) didn't
live here. I could never live here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) go to Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there you speak of happiness based upon violent effort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>the
Baroness rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``That is not what I am looking for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) would never
live in Europe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) would live anywhere, with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, gallantly.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sister looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) still, with a ray of penetration in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
charming eyes; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) turned away again. <div class="bookquote">``You see, at all events,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
presently went on, <div class="bookquote">``that if it had been said of me that I had come over
here to seek my fortune it would have to be added that I have found it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't leave it lying!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>urged Felix, with smiling solemnity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you for your interest,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sister declared, after
a moment. <div class="bookquote">``But promise me one thing: _pas de zèle!_ If Mr. Acton should
ask you to plead his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) cause, excuse yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall certainly have the excuse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``that I have a cause of
my own to plead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) should talk of me--favorably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Eugenia continued, <div class="bookquote">``warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
against dangerous illusions. I detest importunities; I want to decide at
my leisure, with my eyes open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be discreet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``except to you. To you I will say,
Accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) outright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had advanced to the open doorway, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
will go and dress and think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said; and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) moving
slowly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) apartments.

<p/>Late in the afternoon the rain stopped, and just afterwards there was
a great flaming, flickering, trickling sunset. Felix sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
painting-room and did some work; but at last, as the light, which had
not been brilliant, began to fade, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) brushes and came out
to the little piazza of the cottage. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) walked up and down for some
time, looking at the splendid blaze of the western sky and saying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
had often said before, that this was certainly the country of sunsets.
There was something in these glorious deeps of fire that quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
imagination; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) always found images and promises in the western sky. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
thought of a good many things--of roaming about the world with Gertrude
Wentworth; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seemed to see their possible adventures, in a glowing
frieze, between the cloud-bars; then of what Eugenia had just been
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wished very much that Madame Münster would make a
comfortable and honorable marriage. Presently, as the sunset expanded
and deepened, the fancy took him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) of making a note of so magnificent a
piece of coloring. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) studio and fetched out a small
panel, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) palette and brushes, and, placing the panel against a
window-sill, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) began to daub with great gusto. While he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was so occupied
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) saw Mr. Brand, in the distance, slowly come down from Mr. Wentworth's
house, nursing a large folded umbrella. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) walked with a joyless,
meditative tread, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) eyes were bent upon the ground. Felix poised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) brush for a moment, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); then, by a sudden impulse, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) drew nearer, advanced to the garden-gate and signaled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)--the
palette and bunch of brushes contributing to this effect.

<p/>Mr. Brand stopped and started; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) appeared to decide to accept
Felix's invitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) came out of Mr. Wentworth's gate and passed along
the road; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) entered the little garden of the cottage. Felix
had gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sunset; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) visitor welcome while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
rapidly brushed it in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted so much to speak to you that I thought I would call you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
said, in the friendliest tone. <div class="bookquote">``All the more that you have been to
see me so little. You have come to see my sister; I know that. But
you haven't come to see me--the celebrated artist. Artists are very
sensitive, you know; they notice those things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>And Felix turned round,
smiling, with a brush in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>Mr. Brand stood there with a certain blank, candid majesty, pulling
together the large flaps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) umbrella. <div class="bookquote">``Why should I come to see
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of Art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would sound very conceited, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``if I were to
say that it would be a good little chance for you to learn something.
You would ask me why you should learn; and I should have no answer to
that. I suppose a minister has no need for Art, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) has need for good temper, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand, with decision.

<p/>Felix jumped up, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) palette on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) thumb and a movement of the
liveliest deprecation. <div class="bookquote">``That's because I keep you standing there while I
splash my red paint! I beg a thousand pardons! You see what bad manners
Art gives a man; and how right you are to let it alone. I didn't mean
you should stand, either. The piazza, as you see, is ornamented with
rustic chairs; though indeed I ought to warn you that they have nails in
the wrong places. I was just making a note of that sunset. I never saw
such a blaze of different reds. It looks as if the Celestial City were
in flames, eh? If that were really the case I suppose it would be the
business of you theologians to put out the fire. Fancy me--an ungodly
artist--quietly sitting down to paint it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand had always credited Felix Young with a certain impudence, but
it appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) that on this occasion his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) impudence was so great as
to make a special explanation--or even an apology--necessary. And the
impression, it must be added, was sufficiently natural. Felix had at all
times a brilliant assurance of manner which was simply the vehicle of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) good spirits and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) good will; but at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had a special
design, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) would have admitted that the design was audacious, so
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was conscious of having summoned all the arts of conversation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
aid. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was so far from desiring to offend his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) visitor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was
rapidly asking himself what personal compliment he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) could pay the young
clergyman that would gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) most. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) could think of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was
prepared to pay it down. <div class="bookquote">``Have you been preaching one of your beautiful
sermons today?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) suddenly asked, laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) palette. This was not
what Felix had been trying to think of, but it was a tolerable stop-gap.

<p/>Mr. Brand frowned--as much as a man can frown who has very fair, soft
eyebrows, and, beneath them, very gentle, tranquil eyes. <div class="bookquote">``No, I have not
preached any sermon today. Did you bring me over here for the purpose of
making that inquiry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was irritated, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) regretted it immensely; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
had no fear of not being, in the end, agreeable to Mr. Brand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>), smiling and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``No, no, not for
that--not for that. I wanted to ask you something; I wanted to tell
you something. I am sure it will interest you very much. Only--as it is
something rather private--we had better come into my little studio. I
have a western window; we can still see the sunset. _Andiamo!_''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
gave a little pat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) companion's arm.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) led the way in; Mr. Brand stiffly and softly followed. The twilight
had thickened in the little studio; but the wall opposite the western
window was covered with a deep pink flush. There were a great many
sketches and half-finished canvasses suspended in this rosy glow, and
the corners of the room were vague and dusky. Felix begged Mr. Brand to
sit down; then glancing round him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``By Jove, how pretty it looks!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
cried. But Mr. Brand would not sit down; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) went and leaned against
the window; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) wondered what Felix wanted of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>). In the shadow, on the
darker parts of the wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) saw the gleam of three or four pictures
that looked fantastic and surprising. They seemed to represent naked
figures. Felix stood there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) head a little bent and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) eyes
fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) visitor, smiling intensely, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) moustache. Mr.
Brand felt vaguely uneasy. <div class="bookquote">``It is very delicate--what I want to say,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix began. <div class="bookquote">``But I have been thinking of it for some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please to say it as quickly as possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's because you are a clergyman, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix went on. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
think I should venture to say it to a common man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``If it is a question of yielding to a
weakness, of resenting an injury, I am afraid I am a very common man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix, <div class="bookquote">``this is not an injury; it's a
benefit--a great service! You will like it extremely. Only it's so
delicate!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>And, in the dim light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) continued to smile intensely. <div class="bookquote">``You
know I take a great interest in my cousins--in Charlotte and Gertrude
Wentworth. That's very evident from my having traveled some five
thousand miles to see them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand said nothing and Felix proceeded.
<div class="bookquote">``Coming into their society as a perfect stranger I received of course a
great many new impressions, and my impressions had a great freshness, a
great keenness. Do you know what I mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I do; but I should like you to continue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think my impressions have always a good deal of freshness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brand's entertainer; <div class="bookquote">``but on this occasion it was perhaps particularly
natural that--coming in, as I say, from outside--I should be struck with
things that passed unnoticed among yourselves. And then I had my sister
to help me; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is simply the most observant woman in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brand entertainer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand, <div class="bookquote">``that in our little circle two
intelligent persons should have found food for observation. I am sure
that, of late, I have found it myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I shall surprise you yet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Both my
sister and I took a great fancy to my cousin Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your cousin Charlotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Brand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We fell in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) from the first!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You fell in love with Charlotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Dame!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Felix, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s a very charming person; and Eugenia
was especially smitten.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand stood staring, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) pursued,
<div class="bookquote">``Affection, you know, opens one's eyes, and we noticed something.
Charlotte is not happy! Charlotte is in love.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Felix, drawing
nearer, laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hand again upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) companion's arm.

<p/>There was something akin to an acknowledgment of fascination in the way
Mr. Brand looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>); but the young clergyman retained as yet quite
enough self-possession to be able to say, with a good deal of solemnity,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is not in love with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix gave a light laugh, and rejoined with the alacrity of a maritime
adventurer who feels a puff of wind in his (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) sail. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, no; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) were in
love with me I should know it! I am not so blind as you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir, you are stone blind. Poor Charlotte is dead in love with
_you!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand said nothing for a moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) breathed a little heavily. <div class="bookquote">``Is
that what you wanted to say to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have wanted to say it these three weeks. Because of late she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has been
worse. I told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>added Felix, <div class="bookquote">``it was very delicate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Brand began; <div class="bookquote">``well, sir--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sure you didn't know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Felix continued. <div class="bookquote">``But don't you see--as
soon as I mention it--how everything is explained?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand answered
nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) looked for a chair and softly sat down. Felix could see that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was blushing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had looked straight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) host hitherto, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
looked away. The foremost effect of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had heard had been a sort of
irritation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) modesty. <div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``I suggest nothing;
it would be very presumptuous in me to advise you. But I think there is
no doubt about the fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand looked hard at the floor for some moments; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was oppressed
with a mixture of sensations. Felix, standing there, was very sure
that one of them was profound surprise. The innocent young man had been
completely unsuspicious of poor Charlotte's hidden flame. This gave
Felix great hope; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sure that Mr. Brand would be flattered. Felix
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) very transparent, and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was so; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) could neither
simulate nor dissimulate. <div class="bookquote">``I scarcely know what to make of this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
said at last, without looking up; and Felix was struck with the fact
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) offered no protest or contradiction. Evidently Felix had kindled
a train of memories--a retrospective illumination. It was making, to
Mr. Brand's astonished eyes, a very pretty blaze; his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) second emotion had
been a gratification of vanity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank me for telling you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``It's a good thing to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) languish!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix murmured, lightly and softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You _do_ advise me, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Brand looked up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I congratulate you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, smiling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had thought at first his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
visitor was simply appealing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was a little ironical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is in your interest; you have interfered with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>the young
clergyman went on.

<p/>Felix still stood and smiled. The little room had grown darker, and the
crimson glow had faded; but Mr. Brand could see the brilliant expression
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I won't pretend not to know what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix
at last. <div class="bookquote">``But I have not really interfered with you. Of what you had
to lose--with another person--you have lost nothing. And think what you
have gained!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me I am the proper judge, on each side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand
declared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) got up, holding the brim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hat against his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) mouth and
staring at Felix through the dusk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have lost an illusion!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you call an illusion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The belief that you really know--that you have ever really
known--Gertrude Wentworth. Depend upon that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>pursued Felix. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) yet; but I have no illusions; I don't pretend to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand kept gazing, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) has always been a lucid,
limpid nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) said, solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) has always been a dormant nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was waiting for a touchstone.
But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) is beginning to awaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't praise her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand, with a little quaver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
voice. <div class="bookquote">``If you have the advantage of me that is not generous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir, I am melting with generosity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Felix. <div class="bookquote">``And I am
not praising my cousin. I am simply attempting a scientific definition
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) doesn't care for abstractions. Now I think the contrary
is what you have always fancied--is the basis on which you have been
building. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) is extremely preoccupied with the concrete. I care for the
concrete, too. But Gertrude is stronger than I; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) whirls me along!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand looked for a moment into the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``It's a most
interesting nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``But it pulls--it pulls--like a runaway horse.
Now I like the feeling of a runaway horse; and if I am thrown out of
the vehicle it is no great matter. But if _you_ should be thrown, Mr.
Brand'' (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>--and Felix paused a moment--<div class="bookquote">``another person also would suffer
from the accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What other person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte Wentworth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand looked at Felix for a moment sidewise, mistrustfully; then his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
eyes slowly wandered over the ceiling. Felix was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was secretly
struck with the romance of the situation. <div class="bookquote">``I think this is none of our
business,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>the young minister murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None of mine, perhaps; but surely yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand lingered still, looking at the ceiling; there was evidently
something he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) wanted to say. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by Miss Gertrude being
strong?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) asked abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix meditatively, <div class="bookquote">``I mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) has had a great deal
of self-possession. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was waiting--for years; even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) seemed,
perhaps, to be living in the present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) knew how to wait; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had a
purpose. That's what I mean by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) being strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you mean by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) purpose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--the purpose to see the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand eyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) strange informant askance again; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) said nothing.
At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) turned away, as if to take leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) seemed bewildered,
however; for instead of going to the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) moved toward the opposite
corner of the room. Felix stood and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) for a moment--almost
groping about in the dusk; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) to the door, with a tender,
almost fraternal movement. <div class="bookquote">``Is that all you have to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>asked Mr.
Brand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's all--but it will bear a good deal of thinking of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) to the garden-gate, and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) slowly walk
away into the thickening twilight with a relaxed rigidity that tried
to rectify itself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is offended, excited, bewildered, perplexed--and
enchanted!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix said to himself. <div class="bookquote">``That's a capital mixture.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>Since that visit paid by the Baroness Münster to Mrs. Acton, of which
some account was given at an earlier stage of this narrative, the
intercourse between these two ladies had been neither frequent nor
intimate. It was not that Mrs. Acton had failed to appreciate Madame
Münster's charms; on the contrary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) perception of the graces of
manner and conversation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) brilliant visitor had been only too
acute. Mrs. Acton was, as they said in Boston, very <div class="bookquote">``intense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Acton</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
impressions were apt to be too many for her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>). The state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) health
required the restriction of emotion; and this is why, receiving, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) eternal arm-chair, very few visitors, even of the soberest
local type, she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had been obliged to limit the number of her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) interviews
with a lady whose costume and manner recalled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) imagination--Mrs.
Acton's imagination was a marvel--all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had ever read of the most
stirring historical periods. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had sent the Baroness a great many
quaintly-worded messages and a great many nosegays from her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) garden and
baskets of beautiful fruit. Felix had eaten the fruit, and the Baroness
had arranged the flowers and returned the baskets and the messages. On
the day that followed that rainy Sunday of which mention has been made,
Eugenia determined to go and pay the beneficent invalid a _<div class="bookquote">``visite
d’adieux'' (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>_; so it was that, to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) qualified her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) enterprise.
It may be noted that neither on the Sunday evening nor on the Monday
morning had she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) received that expected visit from Robert Acton. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
own consciousness, evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``keeping away;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and as the Baroness,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) side, was keeping away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) uncle's, whither, for several
days, Felix had been the unembarrassed bearer of apologies and regrets
for absence, chance had not taken the cards from the hands of design.
Mr. Wentworth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughters had respected Eugenia's seclusion;
certain intervals of mysterious retirement appeared to them, vaguely, a
natural part of the graceful, rhythmic movement of so remarkable a
life. Gertrude especially held these periods in honor; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wondered
what Madame Münster did at such times, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) would not have permitted
herself to inquire too curiously.

<p/>The long rain had freshened the air, and twelve hours' brilliant
sunshine had dried the roads; so that the Baroness, in the late
afternoon, proposing to walk to Mrs. Acton's, exposed herself to no
great discomfort. As with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) charming undulating step she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) moved along
the clean, grassy margin of the road, beneath the thickly-hanging boughs
of the orchards, through the quiet of the hour and place and the rich
maturity of the summer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was even conscious of a sort of luxurious
melancholy. The Baroness had the amiable weakness of attaching herself
to places--even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had begun with a little aversion; and now, with
the prospect of departure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) felt tenderly toward this well-wooded
corner of the Western world, where the sunsets were so beautiful and
one's ambitions were so pure. Mrs. Acton was able to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>); but on
entering this lady's large, freshly-scented room the Baroness saw that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was looking very ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was wonderfully white and transparent,
and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) flowered arm-chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) made no attempt to move. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
flushed a little--like a young girl, the Baroness thought--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) clear, smiling eyes upon those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) visitor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) voice
was low and monotonous, like a voice that had never expressed any human
passions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come to bid you good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia. <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon be going
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When are you going away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very soon--any day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Acton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Acton. <div class="bookquote">``I hoped you would stay--always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Eugenia demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I mean a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Acton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Acton, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) sweet, feeble tone.
<div class="bookquote">``They tell me you are so comfortable--that you have got such a beautiful
little house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia stared--that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) smiled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) poor little
chalet and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) wondered whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) hostess were jesting. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my house
is exquisite,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``though not to be compared to yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my son is so fond of going to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Acton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Acton added. <div class="bookquote">``I am
afraid my son will miss you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia, with a little laugh, <div class="bookquote">``I can't stay in
America for your son!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like America?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Baroness</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness looked at the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) dress. <div class="bookquote">``If I liked it--that
would not be staying for your son!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Acton gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) grave, tender eyes, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had not
quite understood. The Baroness at last found something irritating in
the sweet, soft stare of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) hostess; and if one were not bound to be
merciful to great invalids she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) would almost have taken the liberty of
pronouncing her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), mentally, a fool. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid, then, I shall never see
you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Acton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Acton. <div class="bookquote">``You know I am dying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>murmured Eugenia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to leave my children cheerful and happy. My daughter will
probably marry her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two such interesting young people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, vaguely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was
not thinking of Clifford Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel so tranquil about my end,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Acton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Acton went on. <div class="bookquote">``It is coming
so easily, so surely.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) paused, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) mild gaze always on
Eugenia's.

<p/>The Baroness hated to be reminded of death; but even in its imminence,
so far as Mrs. Acton was concerned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) good manners. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,
madam, you are too charming an invalid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) rejoined.

<p/>But the delicacy of this rejoinder was apparently lost upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hostess,
who went on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) low, reasonable voice. <div class="bookquote">``I want to leave my children
bright and comfortable. You seem to me all so happy here--just as you
are. So I wish you could stay. It would be so pleasant for Robert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia wondered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) meant by its being pleasant for Robert; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) would never know what such a woman as that meant.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) got up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) was afraid Mrs. Acton would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) again that she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
was dying. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I must remember that your
strength is precious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Acton took her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hand and held it a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you _have_ been
happy here, haven't you? And you like us all, don't you? I wish you
would stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``in your beautiful little house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had told Eugenia that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) waiting-woman would be in the hall, to
show her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) downstairs; but the large landing outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) door was empty,
and Eugenia stood there looking about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) felt irritated; the dying
lady had not _<div class="bookquote">``la main heureuse.'' (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>_ She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) passed slowly downstairs, still
looking about. The broad staircase made a great bend, and in the angle
was a high window, looking westward, with a deep bench, covered with
a row of flowering plants in curious old pots of blue china-ware. The
yellow afternoon light came in through the flowers and flickered a
little on the white wainscots. Eugenia paused a moment; the house was
perfectly still, save for the ticking, somewhere, of a great clock. The
lower hall stretched away at the foot of the stairs, half covered over
with a large Oriental rug. Eugenia lingered a little, noticing a great
many things. _<div class="bookquote">``Comme c’est bien!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said to herself; such a large,
solid, irreproachable basis of existence the place seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) to
indicate. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) reflected that Mrs. Acton was soon to withdraw
from it. The reflection accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) the rest of the way downstairs,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) paused again, making more observations. The hall was extremely
broad, and on either side of the front door was a wide, deeply-set
window, which threw the shadows of everything back into the house.
There were high-backed chairs along the wall and big Eastern vases upon
tables, and, on either side, a large cabinet with a glass front and
little curiosities within, dimly gleaming. The doors were open--into the
darkened parlor, the library, the dining-room. All these rooms seemed
empty. Eugenia passed along, and stopped a moment on the threshold of
each. _<div class="bookquote">``Comme c’est bien!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) murmured again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had thought of just
such a house as this when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) decided to come to America. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) opened
the front door for herself--her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) light tread had summoned none of the
servants--and on the threshold she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) gave a last look. Outside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
was still in the humor for curious contemplation; so instead of going
directly down the little drive, to the gate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) wandered away towards
the garden, which lay to the right of the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had not gone
many yards over the grass before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) paused quickly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) perceived a
gentleman stretched upon the level verdure, beneath a tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had not
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) coming, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lay motionless, flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
hands clasped under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, staring up at the sky; so that the
Baroness was able to reflect, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) leisure, upon the question of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) identity. It was that of a person who had lately been much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
thoughts; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) first impulse, nevertheless, was to turn away; the
last thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) desired was to have the air of coming in quest of Robert
Acton. The gentleman on the grass, however, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) no time to decide;
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not long remain unconscious of so agreeable a presence. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
rolled back his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes, stared, gave an exclamation, and then jumped up.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood an instant, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse my ridiculous position,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just now no sense of the ridiculous. But, in case you have,
don't imagine I came to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>rejoined Acton, <div class="bookquote">``how you put it into my head! I was
thinking of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The occupation of extreme leisure!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``To think of a
woman when you are in that position is no compliment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say I was thinking well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton affirmed, smiling.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) turned away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though I didn't come to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``remember at least that I
am within your gates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted--I am honored! Won't you come into the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just come out of it. I have been calling upon your mother. I
have been bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) farewell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going away,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) turned away again, as if
to illustrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) meaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>asked Acton, standing a moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) place. But
the Baroness made no answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came this way to look at your garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said, walking back to the
gate, over the grass. <div class="bookquote">``But I must go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me at least go with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), and they said nothing
till they reached the gate. It was open, and they looked down the road
which was darkened over with long bosky shadows. <div class="bookquote">``Must you go straight
home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton asked.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) made no answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said, after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``Why have you not been
to see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said nothing, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you answer
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am trying to invent an answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton confessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you none ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None that I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But let me walk with you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may do as you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) moved slowly along the road, and Acton went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>). Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``If I had done as I liked I would have come to see you several
times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that invented?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>asked Eugenia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that is natural. I stayed away because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, here comes the reason, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I wanted to think about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you wanted to lie down!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen you
lie down--almost--in my drawing-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton stopped in the road, with a movement which seemed to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) to
linger a little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) paused, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) awhile; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
very charming. <div class="bookquote">``You are jesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but if you are really going
away it is very serious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) gave a little laugh, <div class="bookquote">``it is more serious still!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When shall you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because we all admire you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not a reason. I am admired also in Europe.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) began to
walk homeward again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What could I say to keep you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>asked Acton. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wanted to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), and
it was a fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) for a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was in
love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) now; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was conscious of that, or he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was; and
the only question with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was whether he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What you can say to keep me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``As I want very much to go
it is not in my interest to tell you. Besides, I can't imagine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) in silence; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was much more affected by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) than appeared. Ever since that evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) return from
Newport her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) image had had a terrible power to trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). What Clifford
Wentworth had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)--that had affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), too, in an adverse sense;
but it had not liberated him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) from the discomfort of a charm of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
intelligence was impatient. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is not honest, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is not honest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
kept murmuring to himself. That is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had been saying to the summer
sky, ten minutes before. Unfortunately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was unable to say it
finally, definitively; and now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) it seemed to matter
wonderfully little. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a woman who will lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had said to
himself. Now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) went along, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) reminded himself of this observation;
but it failed to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) as it had done before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) almost wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) lie and then convict her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) of it, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might see how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should like that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) kept thinking of this as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) side,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) moved forward with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) light, graceful dignity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had sat
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) before; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had driven with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had never walked with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove, how _comme il faut_ she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
sidewise. When they reached the cottage in the orchard she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) passed into
the gate without asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) to follow; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) turned round, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) stood
there, to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) good-night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked you a question the other night which you never answered,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Have you sent off that document--liberating yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hesitated for a single moment--very naturally. Then, <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
said, simply.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) turned away; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wondered whether that would do for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) lie. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) again that evening, for the Baroness reappeared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) uncle's.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had little talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>), however; two gentlemen had driven out from
Boston, in a buggy, to call upon Mr. Wentworth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughters,
and Madame Münster was an object of absorbing interest to both of the
visitors. One of them, indeed, said nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) only sat and
watched with intense gravity, and leaned forward solemnly, presenting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) ear -LRB-a very large one-RRB-, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) were deaf, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) dropped
an observation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had evidently been impressed with the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
misfortunes and reverses: he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) never smiled. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) companion adopted a
lighter, easier style; sat as near as possible to Madame Münster;
attempted to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) out, and proposed every few moments a new topic
of conversation. Eugenia was less vividly responsive than usual and
had less to say than, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) brilliant reputation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) interlocutor
expected, upon the relative merits of European and American
institutions; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) was inaccessible to Robert Acton, who roamed about
the piazza with his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) pockets, listening for the grating
sound of the buggy from Boston, as it should be brought round to the
side-door. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) listened in vain, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) lost patience. His (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
sister came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) to take her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) presently
went off with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Eugenia observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) leaving the house with Lizzie;
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) present mood the fact seemed a contribution to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) irritated
conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had several precious qualities. <div class="bookquote">``Even that
_mal-élevée_ little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) reflected, <div class="bookquote">``makes him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) do what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
wishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had been sitting just within one of the long windows that opened
upon the piazza; but very soon after Acton had gone away she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) got up
abruptly, just when the talkative gentleman from Boston was asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) thought of the <div class="bookquote">``moral tone''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>of that city. On the piazza she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
encountered Clifford Wentworth, coming round from the other side of the
house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) wished to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you go home with your cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Clifford stared. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Robert has taken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so. But you don't usually leave that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford, <div class="bookquote">``I want to see those fellows start off. They don't
know how to drive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not, then, that you have quarreled with your cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Clifford reflected a moment, and then with a simplicity which had, for
the Baroness, a singularly baffling quality, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; we have made up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) for some moments; but Clifford had begun to be afraid
of the Baroness's looks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) endeavored, now, to shift himself out
of their range. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you never come to see me any more?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Have I displeased you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Displeased me? Well, I guess not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford, with a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why haven't you come, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, because I am afraid of getting shut up in that back room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenia kept looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I should think you would like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>cried Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should, if I were a young man calling upon a charming woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A charming woman isn't much use to me when I am shut up in that back
room!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I am not of much use to you anywhere!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame Münster.
<div class="bookquote">``And yet you know how I have offered to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>observed Clifford, by way of response, <div class="bookquote">``there comes the buggy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind the buggy. Do you know I am going away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean in a few days. I leave this place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going back to Europe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Europe, where you are to come and see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I'll come out there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But before that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Eugenia declared, <div class="bookquote">``you must come and see me here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I shall keep clear of that back room!''  (<font color='red'><b>kinsman</b></font>)</div>rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) simple young
kinsman.

<p/>The Baroness was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you must come frankly--boldly.
That will be very much better. I see that now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Clifford. And then, in an instant, <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter
with that buggy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) practiced ear had apparently detected an unnatural
creak in the wheels of the light vehicle which had been brought to the
portico, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) hurried away to investigate so grave an anomaly.

<p/>The Baroness walked homeward, alone, in the starlight, asking herself
a question. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) to have gained nothing--was she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) to have gained
nothing?

<p/>Gertrude Wentworth had held a silent place in the little circle gathered
about the two gentlemen from Boston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was not interested in the
visitors; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was watching Madame Münster, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) constantly watched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knew that Eugenia also was not interested--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) was bored;
and Gertrude was absorbed in study of the problem how, in spite of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) indifference and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) absent attention, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) managed to have such a
charming manner. That was the manner Gertrude would have liked to have;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) determined to cultivate it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wished that--to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) the
charm--she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) might in future very often be bored. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) was engaged in
these researches, Felix Young was looking for Charlotte, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had
something to say. For some time, now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had had something to say to
Charlotte, and this evening his (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sense of the propriety of holding some
special conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had reached the motive-point--resolved
itself into acute and delightful desire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) wandered through the empty
rooms on the large ground-floor of the house, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) at last in
a small apartment denominated, for reasons not immediately apparent, Mr.
Wentworth's <div class="bookquote">``office:''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>an extremely neat and well-dusted room, with an
array of law-books, in time-darkened sheep-skin, on one of the walls; a
large map of the United States on the other, flanked on either side by
an old steel engraving of one of Raphael's Madonnas; and on the third
several glass cases containing specimens of butterflies and beetles.
Charlotte was sitting by a lamp, embroidering a slipper. Felix did not
ask for whom the slipper was destined; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) saw it was very large.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) moved a chair toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) and sat down, smiling as usual, but, at
first, not speaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) needle poised, and with
a certain shy, fluttered look which she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) always wore when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) approached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). There was something in Felix's manner that quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) modesty,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) self-consciousness; if absolute choice had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would
have preferred never to find herself alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>); and in fact,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) a most brilliant, distinguished, and well-meaning
person, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had exercised a much larger amount of tremulous tact than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) had ever suspected, to circumvent the accident of _tête-à-tête_. Poor
Charlotte could have given no account of the matter that would not have
seemed unjust both to herself and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) foreign kinsman; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could only
have said--or rather, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would never have said it--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did
not like so much gentleman's society at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was not reassured,
accordingly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) began, emphasizing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) words with a kind of
admiring radiance, <div class="bookquote">``My dear cousin, I am enchanted at finding you
alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very often alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte observed. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) quickly added, <div class="bookquote">``I
don't mean I am lonely!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So clever a woman as you is never lonely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``You have
company in your beautiful work.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) glanced at the big slipper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>declared Charlotte, simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``And I like to idle too. But it is not
to idle that I have come in search of you. I want to tell you something
very particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte nothing</b></font>)</div>murmured Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">``of course, if you must--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte nothing</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte nothing</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``it's nothing that a young lady may not
listen to. At least I suppose it isn't. But _voyons_; you shall judge. I
am terribly in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Wentworth</b></font>)</div>began Miss Wentworth, gravely. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) very gravity
appeared to check the development of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) phrase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in love with your sister; but in love, Charlotte--in love!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the
young man pursued. Charlotte had laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) work in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lap; her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hands
were tightly folded on top of it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was staring at the carpet. <div class="bookquote">``In
short, I'm in love, dear lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``Now I want you to help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To help you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>asked Charlotte, with a tremor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean with Gertrude; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) and I have a perfect understanding; and
oh, how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) understands one! I mean with your father and with the
world in general, including Mr. Brand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mr. Brand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, slowly, but with a simplicity which
made it evident to Felix that the young minister had not repeated to
Miss Wentworth the talk that had lately occurred between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, now, don't say `poor' Mr. Brand! I don't pity Mr. Brand at all.
But I pity your father a little, and I don't want to displease him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
Therefore, you see, I want you to plead for me. You don't think me very
shabby, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shabby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Charlotte softly, for whom Felix represented the
most polished and iridescent qualities of mankind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean in my appearance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>rejoined Felix, laughing; for Charlotte
was looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) boots. <div class="bookquote">``I mean in my conduct. You don't think it's an
abuse of hospitality?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To--to care for Gertrude?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>asked Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To have really expressed one's self. Because I _have_ expressed myself,
Charlotte; I must tell you the whole truth--I have! Of course I want to
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)--and here is the difficulty. I held off as long as I could;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is such a terribly fascinating person! She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s a strange creature,
Charlotte; I don't believe you really know her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte/Charlotte Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Charlotte took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
tapestry again, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) laid it down. <div class="bookquote">``I know your father has had
higher views,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix continued; <div class="bookquote">``and I think you have shared them. You
have wanted to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to Mr. Brand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, very earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brand has always admired
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). But we did not want anything of that kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix stared. <div class="bookquote">``Surely, marriage was what you proposed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but we didn't wish to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_A la bonne heure!_ That's very unsafe you know. With these arranged
marriages there is often the deuce to pay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, ``we didn't want to `arrange.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted to hear that. Because in such cases--even when the
woman is a thoroughly good creature--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can't help looking for a
compensation. A charming fellow comes along--and _voilà!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte sat
mutely staring at the floor, and Felix presently added, <div class="bookquote">``Do go on with
your slipper, I like to see you work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) variegated canvas, and began to draw vague blue
stitches in a big round rose. <div class="bookquote">``If Gertrude is so--so strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``why do you want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's it, dear Charlotte! I like strange women; I always have
liked them. Ask Eugenia! And Gertrude is wonderful; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) says the most
beautiful things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>), almost for the first time, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) meaning
required to be severely pointed. <div class="bookquote">``You have a great influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--and no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``I had at first, I think; but now it is six
of one and half-a-dozen of the other; it is reciprocal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) affects me
strongly--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) _is_ so strong. I don't believe you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>); it's a
beautiful nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Felix; I have always thought Gertrude's nature beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you think so now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man, <div class="bookquote">``wait and see! She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)'s
a folded flower. Let me pluck her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) from the parent tree and you will see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) expand. I'm sure you will enjoy it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>murmured Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``I _can't_, Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can understand this--that I beg you to say a good word for
me to your father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) regards me, I naturally believe, as a very light
fellow, a Bohemian, an irregular character. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) I am not all this;
if I ever was, I have forgotten it. I am fond of pleasure--yes; but of
innocent pleasure. Pain is all one; but in pleasure, you know, there are
tremendous distinctions. Say to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that Gertrude is a folded flower and
that I am a serious man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) chair slowly rolling up her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``We know you
are very kind to everyone, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But we are extremely sorry
for Mr. Brand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you are--you especially! Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>added Felix hastily, <div class="bookquote">``you
are a woman. But I don't pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>). It ought to be enough for any man
that you take an interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not enough for Mr. Brand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, simply. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stood
there a moment, as if waiting conscientiously for anything more that
Felix might have to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brand is not so keen about his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) marriage as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presently
said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) is afraid of your sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) begins to think she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now with beautiful, appealing eyes--eyes into
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the tears rising. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``what have
you done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was asleep; I have waked her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>But Charlotte, apparently, was really crying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) walked straight out
of the room. And Felix, standing there and meditating, had the apparent
brutality to take satisfaction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) tears.

<p/>Late that night Gertrude, silent and serious, came to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the garden;
it was a kind of appointment. Gertrude seemed to like appointments.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) plucked a handful of heliotrope and stuck it into the front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) dress, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said nothing. They walked together along one of the
paths, and Felix looked at the great, square, hospitable house, massing
itself vaguely in the starlight, with all its windows darkened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a little of a bad conscience,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I oughtn't to meet you
this way till I have got your father's consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for some time. <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You very often say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Considering how little we
understand each other, it is a wonder how well we get on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have done nothing but meet since you came here--but meet alone. The
first time I ever saw you we were alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude went on. <div class="bookquote">``What is the
difference now? Is it because it is at night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The difference, Gertrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, stopping in the path, <div class="bookquote">``the
difference is that I love you more--more than before!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>And then they
stood there, talking, in the warm stillness and in front of the closed
dark house. <div class="bookquote">``I have been talking to Charlotte--been trying to bespeak
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) interest with your father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has a kind of sublime perversity; was
ever a woman so bent upon cutting off her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude; <div class="bookquote">``you are too diplomatic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't come here to make anyone
unhappy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked round her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) awhile in the odorous darkness. <div class="bookquote">``I will do
anything you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For instance?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>asked Felix, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go away. I will do anything you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) in solemn admiration. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, we will go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``But we will make peace first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) again, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) broke out, passionately,
<div class="bookquote">``Why do they try to make one feel guilty? Why do they make it so
difficult? Why can't they understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will make them understand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
arm, and they wandered about in the garden, talking, for an hour.



<p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>Felix allowed Charlotte time to plead his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cause; and then, on the third
day, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sought an interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle. It was in the morning;
Mr. Wentworth was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) office; and, on going in, Felix found that
Charlotte was at that moment in conference with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had, in
fact, been constantly near him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) interview with Felix; she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) duty to repeat very literally her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
cousin's passionate plea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had accordingly followed Mr. Wentworth
about like a shadow, in order to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) at hand when she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) should have
mustered sufficient composure to speak. For poor Charlotte, in this
matter, naturally lacked composure; especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) meditated upon
some of Felix's intimations. It was not cheerful work, at the best, to
keep giving small hammer-taps to the coffin in which one had laid
away, for burial, the poor little unacknowledged offspring of one's own
misbehaving heart; and the occupation was not rendered more agreeable
by the fact that the ghost of one's stifled dream had been summoned from
the shades by the strange, bold words of a talkative young foreigner.
What had Felix meant by saying that Mr. Brand was not so keen? To
herself her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) sister's justly depressed suitor had shown no sign of
faltering. Charlotte trembled all over when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) allowed herself to
believe for an instant now and then that, privately, Mr. Brand might
have faltered; and as it seemed to give more force to Felix's words to
repeat them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was waiting until she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) should have taught
herself to be very calm. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had now begun to tell Mr. Wentworth
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was extremely anxious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was proceeding to develop this idea,
to enumerate the objects of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) anxiety, when Felix came in.

<p/>Mr. Wentworth sat there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) legs crossed, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) dry, pure
countenance from the Boston _Advertiser_. Felix entered smiling, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had something particular to say, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) both expected and deprecated this event. Felix vividly expressing
himself had come to be a formidable figure to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle, who had not yet
arrived at definite views as to a proper tone. For the first time in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) life, as I have said, Mr. Wentworth shirked a responsibility; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
earnestly desired that it might not be laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) to determine how
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) nephew's lighter propositions should be treated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) lived under an
apprehension that Felix might yet beguile him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) into assent to doubtful
inductions, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) conscience instructed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) that the best form of
vigilance was the avoidance of discussion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hoped that the pleasant
episode of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) nephew's visit would pass away without a further lapse of
consistency.

<p/>Felix looked at Charlotte with an air of understanding, and then at Mr.
Wentworth, and then at Charlotte again. Mr. Wentworth bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) refined
eyebrows upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) nephew and stroked down the first page of the
_Advertiser_. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to have brought a bouquet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, laughing.
<div class="bookquote">``In France they always do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not in France,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Wentworth, gravely, while Charlotte
earnestly gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, luckily, we are not in France, where I am afraid I should have
a harder time of it. My dear Charlotte, have you rendered me that
delightful service?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>And Felix bent toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) as if someone had been
presenting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/>Charlotte looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) with almost frightened eyes; and Mr. Wentworth
thought this might be the beginning of a discussion. <div class="bookquote">``What is the
bouquet for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) inquired, by way of turning it off.

<p/>Felix gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), smiling. _<div class="bookquote">``Pour la demande!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>_ And then, drawing up
a chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) seated himself, hat in hand, with a kind of conscious
solemnity.

<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) turned to Charlotte again. <div class="bookquote">``My good Charlotte, my admirable
Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``you have not played me false--you have not
sided against me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte got up, trembling extremely, though imperceptibly. <div class="bookquote">``You must
speak to my father yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I think you are clever enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>But Felix, rising too, begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to remain. <div class="bookquote">``I can speak better to an
audience!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it is nothing disagreeable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's something delightful, for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>And Felix, laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hat,
clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hands a little between his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``My dear uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``I desire, very earnestly, to marry your daughter Gertrude.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Charlotte
sank slowly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) chair again, and Mr. Wentworth sat staring, with a
light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) face that might have been flashed back from an iceberg.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) stared and stared; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said nothing. Felix fell back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hands
still clasped. <div class="bookquote">``Ah--you don't like it. I was afraid!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) blushed deeply,
and Charlotte noticed it--remarking to herself that it was the first
time she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) blush. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) began to blush herself and to
reflect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might be much in love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very abrupt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you never suspected it, dear uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix inquired. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that
proves how discreet I have been. Yes, I thought you wouldn't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very serious, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think it's an abuse of hospitality!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Felix, smiling
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of hospitality?--an abuse?''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle repeated very slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what Felix said to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, conscientiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you think so; don't defend yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix pursued. <div class="bookquote">``It
_is_ an abuse, obviously; the most I can claim is that it is perhaps a
pardonable one. I simply fell head over heels in love; one can hardly
help that. Though you are Gertrude's progenitor I don't believe you
know how attractive she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) is. Dear uncle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) contains the elements of a
singularly--I may say a strangely--charming woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has always been to me an object of extreme concern,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``We have always desired her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, here it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix declared. <div class="bookquote">``I will make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believes
it, too. Now hadn't you noticed that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was much changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth declared, in
a tone whose unexpressive, unimpassioned quality appeared to Felix to
reveal a profundity of opposition. <div class="bookquote">``It may be that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is only becoming
what you call a charming woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gertrude, at heart, is so earnest, so true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, very
softly, fastening her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I delight to hear you praise her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) has a very peculiar temperament,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, even that is praise!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``I know I am not the man you
might have looked for. I have no position and no fortune; I can give
Gertrude no place in the world. A place in the world--that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
ought to have; that would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A place to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) duty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how charmingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) does it--her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) duty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix exclaimed, with a
radiant face. <div class="bookquote">``What an exquisite conception she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) has of it! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) comes
honestly by that, dear uncle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte both looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) as if they were watching a greyhound doubling. <div class="bookquote">``Of course with
me she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) light under a bushel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``I being the
bushel! Now I know you like me--you have certainly proved it. But you
think I am frivolous and penniless and shabby! Granted--granted--a
thousand times granted. I have been a loose fish--a fiddler, a painter,
an actor. But there is this to be said: In the first place, I fancy
you exaggerate; you lend me qualities I haven't had. I have been a
Bohemian--yes; but in Bohemia I always passed for a gentleman. I wish
you could see some of my old _camarades_--they would tell you! It
was the liberty I liked, but not the opportunities! My sins were all
peccadilloes; I always respected my neighbor's property--my neighbor's
wife. Do you see, dear uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth ought to have seen; his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
cold blue eyes were intently fixed. <div class="bookquote">``And then, _c’est fini!_ It's all
over. _Je me range_. I have settled down to a jog-trot. I find I can
earn my living--a very fair one--by going about the world and painting
bad portraits. It's not a glorious profession, but it is a perfectly
respectable one. You won't deny that, eh? Going about the world, I say?
I must not deny that, for that I am afraid I shall always do--in quest
of agreeable sitters. When I say agreeable, I mean susceptible of
delicate flattery and prompt of payment. Gertrude declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) is
willing to share my wanderings and help to pose my models. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) even
thinks it will be charming; and that brings me to my third point.
Gertrude likes me. Encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) a little and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) will tell you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix's tongue obviously moved much faster than the imagination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
auditors; his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) eloquence, like the rocking of a boat in a deep, smooth
lake, made long eddies of silence. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) seemed to be pleading and
chattering still, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) brightly eager smile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uplifted eyebrows,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) expressive mouth, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had ceased speaking, and while, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
glance quickly turning from the father to the daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sat waiting
for the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) appeal. <div class="bookquote">``It is not your want of means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Wentworth, after a period of severe reticence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now it's delightful of you to say that! Only don't say it's my want of
character. Because I have a character--I assure you I have; a small one,
a little slip of a thing, but still something tangible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought you not to tell Felix that it is Mr. Brand, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Charlotte
asked, with infinite mildness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not only Mr. Brand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth solemnly declared. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knee for a long time. <div class="bookquote">``It is difficult to explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wished, evidently, to be very just. <div class="bookquote">``It rests on moral grounds,
as Mr. Brand says. It is the question whether it is the best thing for
Gertrude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is better--what is better, dear uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix rejoined urgently,
rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) urgency and standing before Mr. Wentworth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) uncle had
been looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) knee; but when Felix moved he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) transferred his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) gaze
to the handle of the door which faced him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is usually a fairly good
thing for a girl to marry the man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loves!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) spoke, Mr. Wentworth saw the handle of the door begin to turn;
the door opened and remained slightly ajar, until Felix had delivered
himself of the cheerful axiom just quoted. Then it opened altogether
and Gertrude stood there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) looked excited; there was a spark in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>)
sweet, dull eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) came in slowly, but with an air of resolution,
and, closing the door softly, looked round at the three persons present.
Felix went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) with tender gallantry, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hand, and
Charlotte made a place for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) on the sofa. But Gertrude put her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) hands
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) and made no motion to sit down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are talking of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``That's why I came.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) fastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father, who returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) gaze very fixedly. In his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own cold
blue eyes there was a kind of pleading, reasoning light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is better you should be present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth. <div class="bookquote">``We are
discussing your future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why discuss it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Gertrude. <div class="bookquote">``Leave it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is, to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I leave it, in the last resort, to a greater wisdom than ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said
the old man.

<p/>Felix rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) forehead gently. <div class="bookquote">``But _en attendant_ the last resort,
your father lacks confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said to Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you confidence in Felix?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude was frowning; there was
something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father and Charlotte had never seen.
Charlotte got up and came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), as if to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); but
suddenly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) seemed afraid to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Wentworth, however, was not afraid. <div class="bookquote">``I have had more confidence in
Felix than in you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have never had confidence in me--never, never! I don't know
why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh sister, sister!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>murmured Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have always needed advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wentworth declared. <div class="bookquote">``You have had a
difficult temperament.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you call it difficult? It might have been easy, if you had
allowed it. You wouldn't let me be natural. I don't know what you wanted
to make of me. Mr. Brand was the worst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte at last took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) two hands upon
Gertrude's arm. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) cares so much for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) almost whispered.

<p/>Gertrude looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) intently an instant; then kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
does not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never seen you so passionate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Wentworth, with an
air of indignation mitigated by high principles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry if I offend you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You offend me, but I don't think you are sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would even go further, dear uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix interposed. <div class="bookquote">``I would
question whether she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) really offends you. How can she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) offend you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Mr. Wentworth made no immediate answer. Then, in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
has not profited as we hoped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Profited? _Ah voilà!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix exclaimed.

<p/>Gertrude was very pale; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) stood looking down. <div class="bookquote">``I have told Felix I
would go away with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) presently said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have said some admirable things!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>asked Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Away--away; to some strange country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is to frighten you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix, smiling at Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To--what do you call it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Gertrude, turning an instant to Felix.
<div class="bookquote">``To Bohemia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you propose to dispense with preliminaries?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Wentworth,
getting up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear uncle, _vous plaisantez!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that these
are preliminaries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``I _have_ profited,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You
wanted to form my character. Well, my character is formed--for my age.
I know what I want; I have chosen. I am determined to marry this
gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better consent, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix very gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, you had better consent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>added a very different voice.

<p/>Charlotte gave a little jump, and the others turned to the direction
from which it had come. It was the voice of Mr. Brand, who had stepped
through the long window which stood open to the piazza. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) stood patting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was very much flushed; his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
face wore a singular expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, you had better consent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand repeated, coming forward.
<div class="bookquote">``I know what Miss Gertrude means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>murmured Felix, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hand caressingly on the
young minister's arm.

<p/>Mr. Brand looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>); then at Mr. Wentworth; lastly at Gertrude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
did not look at Charlotte. But Charlotte's earnest eyes were fastened
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own countenance; they were asking an immense question of it.
The answer to this question could not come all at once; but some of the
elements of it were there. It was one of the elements of it that Mr.
Brand was very red, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) head very high, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had a
bright, excited eye and an air of embarrassed boldness--the air of a
man who has taken a resolve, in the execution of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) apprehends
the failure, not of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moral, but of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal, resources. Charlotte
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked very grand; and it is incontestable that Mr. Brand
felt very grand. This, in fact, was the grandest moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) life;
and it was natural that such a moment should contain opportunities of
awkwardness for a large, stout, modest young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, with an angular wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``It is very proper that you should be present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what you are talking about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brand rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``I heard what
your nephew said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) heard what you said!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Felix, patting him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) again on the
arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I understood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth, who had
angularity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) voice as well as in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) gestures.

<p/>Gertrude had been looking hard at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) former suitor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) had been
puzzled, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) imagination moved more quickly than
Charlotte's. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brand asked you to let Felix take me away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father.

<p/>The young minister gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a strange look. <div class="bookquote">``It is not because I don't
want to see you any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) declared, in a tone intended as it were
for publicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think you would want to see me any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude
answered, gently.

<p/>Mr. Wentworth stood staring. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't this rather a change, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Brand looked anywhere; only still not at Charlotte.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) repeated. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) handkerchief a few moments to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are our moral grounds?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Wentworth, who had always
thought Mr. Brand would be just the thing for a younger daughter with a
peculiar temperament.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is sometimes very moral to change, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>suggested Felix.

<p/>Charlotte had softly left her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister's side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had edged gently toward
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, and now her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hand found its way into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm. Mr. Wentworth
had folded up the _Advertiser_ into a surprisingly small compass, and,
holding the roll with one hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) earnestly clasped it with the other.
Mr. Brand was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>); and yet, though Charlotte was so near, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
eyes failed to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own. Gertrude watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is better not to speak of change,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brand. <div class="bookquote">``In one sense
there is no change. There was something I desired--something I asked of
you; I desire something still--I ask it of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) paused a moment;
Mr. Wentworth looked bewildered. <div class="bookquote">``I should like, in my ministerial
capacity, to unite this young couple.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister, saw Charlotte flushing intensely, and Mr.
Wentworth felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) pressing upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``Heavenly Powers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>murmured
Mr. Wentworth. And it was the nearest approach to profanity he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had ever
made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very nice; that is very handsome!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth; though it was plain that
everyone else did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very beautiful, Mr. Brand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Gertrude, emulating Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to marry you. It will give me great pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As Gertrude says, it's a beautiful idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/>Felix was smiling, but Mr. Brand was not even trying to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) himself
treated his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) proposition very seriously. <div class="bookquote">``I have thought of it, and I
should like to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) affirmed.

<p/>Charlotte, meanwhile, was staring with expanded eyes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) imagination,
as I have said, was not so rapid as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister's, but now it had taken
several little jumps. <div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``consent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) looked away. Mr. Wentworth, evidently, had no
imagination at all. <div class="bookquote">``I have always thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) began, slowly, <div class="bookquote">``that
Gertrude's character required a special line of development.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte consent</b></font>)</div>repeated Charlotte, _<div class="bookquote">``consent.'' (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte consent</b></font>)</div>_

<p/>Then, at last, Mr. Brand looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) leaning more
heavily upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) folded arm than she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had ever done before; and this,
with a certain sweet faintness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) voice, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) wonder what was
the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) and saw the encounter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gaze with
the young theologian's; but even this told him (<font color='blue'><b>theologian</b></font>) nothing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>theologian</b></font>) continued
to be bewildered. Nevertheless, <div class="bookquote">``I consent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>theologian</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``since Mr.
Brand recommends it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to perform the ceremony very soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Brand,
with a sort of solemn simplicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, that's charming!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>cried Felix, profanely.

<p/>Mr. Wentworth sank into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Doubtless, when you understand it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said, with a certain judicial asperity.

<p/>Gertrude went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) sister and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) away, and Felix having passed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) arm into Mr. Brand's and stepped out of the long window with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>),
the old man was left sitting there in unillumined perplexity.

<p/>Felix did no work that day. In the afternoon, with Gertrude, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got into
one of the boats and floated about with idly-dipping oars. They talked a
good deal of Mr. Brand--though not exclusively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a fine stroke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``It was really heroic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude sat musing, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) eyes upon the ripples. <div class="bookquote">``That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
wanted to be; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) wanted to do something fine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) won't be comfortable till he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) has married us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``So much
the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) wanted to be magnanimous; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) wanted to have a fine moral pleasure.
I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div>Gertrude went on. Felix looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) spoke
slowly, gazing at the clear water. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) thought of it a great deal, night
and day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) thought it would be beautiful. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) mind
that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) duty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) duty to do just that--nothing less than that.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) felt exalted; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) felt sublime. That's how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) likes to feel. It is
better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) than if I had listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's better for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>smiled Felix. <div class="bookquote">``But do you know, as regards the
sacrifice, that I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) admired you when this decision was
taken quite so much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) had done a fortnight before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) never admired me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) admires Charlotte; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) pitied me. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) so
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) didn't pity you so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gertrude/Gertrude Wentworth/Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Gertrude looked at Felix a little, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't permit
yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to diminish the splendor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) action. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) admires
Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's capital!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>said Felix laughingly, and dipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) oars. I cannot
say exactly to which member of Gertrude's phrase he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) alluded; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) oars again, and they kept floating about.

<p/>Neither Felix nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) sister, on that day, was present at Mr.
Wentworth's at the evening repast. The two occupants of the chalet dined
together, and the young man informed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage was
now an assured fact. Eugenia congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and replied that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
were as reasonable a husband as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been, on the whole, a brother,
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife would have nothing to complain of.

<p/>Felix looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a moment, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``not to be
thrown back on my reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>Eugenia rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``that one's reason is dismally
flat. It's a bed with the mattress removed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/>But the brother and sister, later in the evening, crossed over to
the larger house, the Baroness desiring to compliment her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) prospective
sister-in-law. They found the usual circle upon the piazza, with the
exception of Clifford Wentworth and Lizzie Acton; and as everyone stood
up as usual to welcome the Baroness, Eugenia had an admiring audience
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) compliment to Gertrude.

<p/>Robert Acton stood on the edge of the piazza, leaning against one of
the white columns, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) found himself next to Eugenia while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
acquitted herself of a neat little discourse of congratulation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be so glad to know you better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I have seen so much
less of you than I should have liked. Naturally; now I see the reason
why! You will love me a little, won't you? I think I may say I gain
on being known.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And terminating these observations with the softest
cadence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) voice, the Baroness imprinted a sort of grand official
kiss upon Gertrude's forehead.

<p/>Increased familiarity had not, to Gertrude's imagination, diminished
the mysterious impressiveness of Eugenia's personality, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) felt
flattered and transported by this little ceremony. Robert Acton
also seemed to admire it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) admired so many of the gracious
manifestations of Madame Münster's wit.

<p/>They had the privilege of making him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) restless, and on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
walked away, suddenly, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) pockets, and then came back
and leaned against his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) column. Eugenia was now complimenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) uncle
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) daughter's engagement, and Mr. Wentworth was listening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
usual plain yet refined politeness. It is to be supposed that by this
time his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) perception of the mutual relations of the young people who
surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had become more acute; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) still took the matter very
seriously, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was not at all exhilarated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Felix will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a good husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will be a
charming companion; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has a great quality--indestructible gaiety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think that's a great quality?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the old man.

<p/>Eugenia meditated, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) eyes upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You think one gets tired of
it, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I am prepared to say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we will say, then, that it is tiresome for others but delightful
for one's self. A woman's husband, you know, is supposed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
second self; so that, for Felix and Gertrude, gaiety will be a common
property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gertrude was always very gay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wentworth/Clifford/Clifford Wentworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wentworth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was trying to
follow this argument.

<p/>Robert Acton took his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) pockets and came a little nearer
to the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``You say you gain by being known,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``One
certainly gains by knowing you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have _you_ gained?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>asked Eugenia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An immense amount of wisdom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a questionable advantage for a man who was already so wise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No, I was a great fool before I knew you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And being a fool you made my acquaintance? You are very complimentary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me keep it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I hope, for our pleasure,
that your brother's marriage will detain you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I stop for my brother's marriage when I would not stop for
my own?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't you stop in either case, now that, as you say, you have
dissolved that mechanical tie that bound you to Europe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Baroness</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``As I say? You look as if you
doubted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>said Acton, returning her (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) glance, <div class="bookquote">``that is a remnant of my old
folly! We have other attractions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``We are to have another
marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) seemed not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) still. <div class="bookquote">``My word
was never doubted before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are to have another marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton repeated, smiling.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) appeared to understand. <div class="bookquote">``Another marriage?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) looked at
the others. Felix was chattering to Gertrude; Charlotte, at a distance,
was watching them; and Mr. Brand, in quite another quarter, was turning
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) back to them, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hands under his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) coat-tails and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) large
head on one side, was looking at the small, tender crescent of a young
moon. <div class="bookquote">``It ought to be Mr. Brand and Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia, <div class="bookquote">``but it
doesn't look like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton answered, <div class="bookquote">``you must judge just now by contraries. There
is more than there looks to be. I expect that combination one of these
days; but that is not what I meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, <div class="bookquote">``I never guess my own lovers; so I can't
guess other people's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton gave a loud laugh, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) was about to add a rejoinder when Mr.
Wentworth approached his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) niece. <div class="bookquote">``You will be interested to hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the
old man said, with a momentary aspiration toward jocosity, <div class="bookquote">``of another
matrimonial venture in our little circle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just telling the Baroness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Acton was apparently about to announce his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) own engagement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said
Eugenia.

<p/>Mr. Wentworth's jocosity increased. <div class="bookquote">``It is not exactly that; but it
is in the family. Clifford, hearing this morning that Mr. Brand had
expressed a desire to tie the nuptial knot for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) sister, took it into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) head to arrange that, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>) hand was in, our good friend should
perform a like ceremony for himself and Lizzie Acton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/>The Baroness threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) head and smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) uncle; then turning,
with an intenser radiance, to Robert Acton, <div class="bookquote">``I am certainly very stupid
not to have thought of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert Acton/Robert</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said. Acton looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>)
boots, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) had perhaps reached the limits of legitimate
experimentation, and for a moment Eugenia said nothing more. It had
been, in fact, a sharp knock, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) needed to recover herself. This
was done, however, promptly enough. <div class="bookquote">``Where are the young people?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are spending the evening with my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not the thing very sudden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Acton looked up. <div class="bookquote">``Extremely sudden. There had been a tacit
understanding; but within a day or two Clifford appears to have received
some mysterious impulse to precipitate the affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The impulse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, <div class="bookquote">``was the charms of your very pretty
sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Münster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my sister's charms were an old story; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) had always known her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton had begun to experiment again.

<p/>Here, however, it was evident the Baroness would not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah, one
can't say! Clifford is very young; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) is a nice boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>)'s a likeable sort of boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) will be a rich man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>This was
Acton's last experiment. Madame Münster turned away.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) made but a short visit and Felix took her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) home. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) little
drawing-room she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) went almost straight to the mirror over the
chimney-piece, and, with a candle uplifted, stood looking into it. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall not wait for your marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow my
maid shall pack up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>Felix exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``we are to be married immediately!
Mr. Brand is too uncomfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div><p/>But Eugenia, turning and still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) candle aloft, only looked
about the little sitting-room at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) gimcracks and curtains and
cushions. <div class="bookquote">``My maid shall pack up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) repeated. ``_Bonté divine_, what
rubbish! I feel like a strolling actress; these are my `properties.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the play over, Eugenia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Young</b></font>)</div>asked Felix.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a sharp glance. <div class="bookquote">``I have spoken my part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With great applause!''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, applause--applause!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) murmured. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) gathered up two or three
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) dispersed draperies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) glanced at the beautiful brocade, and
then, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see how I can have endured it!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Endure it a little longer. Come to my wedding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; that's your affair. My affairs are elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Germany--by the first ship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have decided not to marry Mr. Acton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) brother looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) in silence. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rejoined at last.
<div class="bookquote">``But I was very discreet, as you asked me to be. I said nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please continue, then, not to allude to the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenia</b></font>)</div>said Eugenia.

<p/>Felix inclined himself gravely. <div class="bookquote">``You shall be obeyed. But your position
in Germany?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pursued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please to make no observations upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only going to say that I supposed it was altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought you had signed--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not signed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness.

<p/>Felix urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) no further, and it was arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should
immediately assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to embark.

<p/>Mr. Brand was indeed, it appeared, very impatient to consummate his (<font color='blue'><b>Brand</b></font>)
sacrifice and deliver the nuptial benediction which would set it off so
handsomely; but Eugenia's impatience to withdraw from a country in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had not found the fortune she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had come to seek was even less to be
mistaken. It is true she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had not made any very various exertion; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) appeared to feel justified in generalizing--in deciding that the
conditions of action on this provincial continent were not favorable
to really superior women. The elder world was, after all, their natural
field. The unembarrassed directness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) proceeded to
apply these intelligent conclusions appeared to the little circle of
spectators who have figured in our narrative but the supreme exhibition
of a character to which the experience of life had imparted an
inimitable pliancy. It had a distinct effect upon Robert Acton, who, for
the two days preceding her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) departure, was a very restless and irritated
mortal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) last evening at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) uncle's, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenia</b></font>) had never
been more charming; and in parting with Clifford Wentworth's affianced
bride she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) own finger a curious old ring and presented it
to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) with the prettiest speech and kiss. Gertrude, who as an affianced
bride was also indebted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) gracious bounty, admired this little
incident extremely, and Robert Acton almost wondered whether it did not
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) the right, as Lizzie's brother and guardian, to offer in return
a handsome present to the Baroness. It would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) extremely
happy to be able to offer a handsome present to the Baroness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
abstained from this expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sentiments, and they were in
consequence, at the very last, by so much the less comfortable. It was
almost at the very last that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)--late the night before she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) went
to Boston to embark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For myself, I wish you might have stayed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But not for your
own sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't make so many differences,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``I am simply
sorry to be going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a much deeper difference than mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div>Acton declared; <div class="bookquote">``for you
mean you are simply glad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Acton/Lizzie/Lizzie Acton</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix parted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) on the deck of the ship. <div class="bookquote">``We shall often meet over
there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Europe seems to me much larger than
America.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brand</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brand, of course, in the days that immediately followed, was not the
only impatient spirit; but it may be said that of all the young spirits
interested in the event none rose more eagerly to the level of the
occasion. Gertrude left her (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) father's house with Felix Young; they were
imperturbably happy and they went far away. Clifford and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clifford</b></font>) young wife
sought their felicity in a narrower circle, and the latter's influence
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband was such as to justify, strikingly, that theory of the
elevating effect of easy intercourse with clever women which Felix had
propounded to Mr. Wentworth. Gertrude was for a good while a distant
figure, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gertrude</b></font>) came back when Charlotte married Mr. Brand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
present at the wedding feast, where Felix's gaiety confessed to no
change. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) disappeared, and the echo of a gaiety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own,
mingled with that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) husband, often came back to the home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
earlier years. Mr. Wentworth at last found himself listening for it;
and Robert Acton, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Acton</b></font>) mother's death, married a particularly nice
young girl.
