<p/>Editorial note:

<p/>_The Way We Live Now_ was first published in twenty monthly
parts from February, 1874, to September, 1875, and in book
form by Chapman and Hall in 1875.

<p/>Both the monthly parts and the Chapman and Hall first edition
contained forty illustrations. The artist, whose name is not
listed on the title page, was long thought to be Samuel Luke
Fildes, but recent scholarship attributes the illustrations
to Lionel Grimston Fawkes. These illustrations are included
in this e-book and can be seen by viewing the HTML version

<p/>CHAPTER I.

<p/>THREE EDITORS.


<p/>Let the reader be introduced to Lady Carbury, upon whose character
and doings much will depend of whatever interest these pages may
have, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sits at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) writing-table in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own room in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own
house in Welbeck Street. Lady Carbury spent many hours at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) desk,
and wrote many letters,--wrote also very much beside letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
spoke of herself in these days as a woman devoted to Literature,
always spelling the word with a big L. Something of the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
devotion may be learned by the perusal of three letters which on this
morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had written with a quickly running hand. Lady Carbury was
rapid in everything, and in nothing more rapid than in the writing of
letters. Here is Letter No. 1;--


<p/>Thursday,
Welbeck Street.

<p/>DEAR FRIEND,--

<p/>I have taken care that you shall have the early sheets of
my two new volumes to-morrow, or Saturday at latest, so
that you may, if so minded, give a poor struggler like
myself a lift in your next week's paper. Do give a poor
struggler a lift. You and I have so much in common, and
I have ventured to flatter myself that we are really
friends! I do not flatter you when I say, that not only
would aid from you help me more than from any other
quarter, but also that praise from you would gratify my
vanity more than any other praise. I almost think you will
like my <div class="bookquote">``Criminal Queens.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The sketch of Semiramis is at
any rate spirited, though I had to twist it about a little
to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in guilty. Cleopatra, of course, I have taken
from Shakespeare. What a wench she (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) was! I could not quite
make Julia a queen; but it was impossible to pass over
so piquant a character. You will recognise in the two or
three ladies of the empire how faithfully I have studied
my Gibbon. Poor dear old Belisarius! I have done the best
I could with Joanna, but I could not bring myself to
care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Joanna</b></font>). In our days she (<font color='blue'><b>Joanna</b></font>) would simply have gone to
Broadmore. I hope you will not think that I have been too
strong in my delineations of Henry VIII. and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sinful
but unfortunate Howard. I don't care a bit about Anne
Boleyne. I am afraid that I have been tempted into too
great length about the Italian Catherine; but in truth she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
has been my favourite. What a woman! What a devil! Pity
that a second Dante could not have constructed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a
special hell. How one traces the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) training
in the life of our Scotch Mary. I trust you will go with
me in my view as to the Queen of Scots. Guilty! guilty
always! Adultery, murder, treason, and all the rest of it.
But recommended to mercy because she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was royal. A queen
bred, born and married, and with such other queens around
her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), how could she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) have escaped to be guilty? Marie
Antoinette I have not quite acquitted. It would be
uninteresting;--perhaps untrue. I have accused her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>)
lovingly, and have kissed when I scourged. I trust
the British public will not be angry because I do not
whitewash Caroline, especially as I go along with them
altogether in abusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) husband.

<p/>But I must not take up your time by sending you another
book, though it gratifies me to think that I am writing
what none but yourself will read. Do it yourself, like a
dear man, and, as you are great, be merciful. Or rather,
as you are a friend, be loving.

<p/>Yours gratefully and faithfully,

<p/>MATILDA CARBURY.

<p/>After all how few women there are who can raise themselves
above the quagmire of what we call love, and make
themselves anything but playthings for men. Of almost all
these royal and luxurious sinners it was the chief sin
that in some phase of their lives they consented to be
playthings without being wives. I have striven so hard to
be proper; but when girls read everything, why should not
an old woman write anything?


<p/>This letter was addressed to Nicholas Broune, Esq., the editor of the
<div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table,''  (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>a daily newspaper of high character; and,
as it was the longest, so was it considered to be the most important
of the three. Mr. Broune was a man powerful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) profession,--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was fond of ladies. Lady Carbury in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) letter had called herself
an old woman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was satisfied to do so by a conviction that no
one else regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in that light. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) age shall be no secret to
the reader, though to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) most intimate friends, even to Mr. Broune,
it had never been divulged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was forty-three, but carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
years so well, and had received such gifts from nature, that it was
impossible to deny that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was still a beautiful woman. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
used her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) beauty not only to increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) influence,--as is natural
to women who are well-favoured,--but also with a well-considered
calculation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could obtain material assistance in the
procuring of bread and cheese, which was very necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), by
a prudent adaptation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) purposes of the good things with which
providence had endowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not fall in love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not
wilfully flirt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not commit herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) smiled and
whispered, and made confidences, and looked out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own eyes into
men's eyes as though there might be some mysterious bond between her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
and them--if only mysterious circumstances would permit it. But the
end of all was to induce some one to do something which would cause
a publisher to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) good payment for indifferent writing, or an
editor to be lenient when, upon the merits of the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) should
have been severe. Among all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) literary friends, Mr. Broune was the
one in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) most trusted; and Mr. Broune was fond of handsome
women. It may be as well to give a short record of a scene which had
taken place between Lady Carbury and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend about a month before
the writing of this letter which has been produced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had wanted
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to take a series of papers for the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and
to have them paid for at rate No. 1, whereas she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
was rather doubtful as to their merit, and knew that, without special
favour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not hope for remuneration above rate No. 2, or
possibly even No. 3. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes, and had left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) soft, plump hand for a moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). A man in such circumstances
is so often awkward, not knowing with any accuracy when to do one
thing and when another! Mr. Broune, in a moment of enthusiasm, had
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) arm round Lady Carbury's waist and had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). To say
that Lady Carbury was angry, as most women would be angry if so
treated, would be to give an unjust idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) character. It was a
little accident which really carried with it no injury, unless it
should be the injury of leading to a rupture between herself and
a valuable ally. No feeling of delicacy was shocked. What did it
matter? No unpardonable insult had been offered; no harm had been
done, if only the dear susceptible old donkey could be made at once
to understand that that wasn't the way to go on!

<p/>Without a flutter, and without a blush, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) arm, and
then made him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) an excellent little speech. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Broune, how foolish,
how wrong, how mistaken! Is it not so? Surely you do not wish to put
an end to the friendship between us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put an end to our friendship, Lady Carbury! Oh, certainly not that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why risk it by such an act? Think of my son and of my
daughter,--both grown up. Think of the past troubles of my life;--so
much suffered and so little deserved. No one knows them so well as
you do. Think of my name, that has been so often slandered but never
disgraced! Say that you are sorry, and it shall be forgotten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>When a man has kissed a woman it goes against the grain with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
say the very next moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is sorry for what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done. It is
as much as to declare that the kiss had not answered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expectation.
Mr. Broune could not do this, and perhaps Lady Carbury did not quite
expect it. <div class="bookquote">``You know that for worlds I would not offend you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
said. This sufficed. Lady Carbury again looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) eyes, and
a promise was given that the articles should be printed--and with
generous remuneration.

<p/>When the interview was over Lady Carbury regarded it as having been
quite successful. Of course when struggles have to be made and hard
work done, there will be little accidents. The lady who uses a street
cab must encounter mud and dust which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) richer neighbour, who has a
private carriage, will escape. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have preferred not to have
been kissed;--but what did it matter? With Mr. Broune the affair was
more serious. <div class="bookquote">``Confound them all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) left the
house; <div class="bookquote">``no amount of experience enables a man to know them.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
went away he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) almost thought that Lady Carbury had intended him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) to
kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was almost angry with himself in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had
not done so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) three or four times since, but had not
repeated the offence.

<p/>We will now go on to the other letters, both of which were addressed
to the editors of other newspapers. The second was written to Mr.
Booker, of the <div class="bookquote">``Literary Chronicle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>Mr. Booker was a hard-working
professor of literature, by no means without talent, by no means
without influence, and by no means without a conscience. But,
from the nature of the struggles in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) had been engaged,
by compromises which had gradually been driven upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) by the
encroachment of brother authors on the one side and by the demands
on the other of employers who looked only to their profits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) had
fallen into a routine of work in which it was very difficult to be
scrupulous, and almost impossible to maintain the delicacies of a
literary conscience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) was now a bald-headed old man of sixty, with
a large family of daughters, one of whom was a widow dependent on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) with two little children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) had five hundred a year for editing
the <div class="bookquote">``Literary Chronicle,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>which, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) energy, had become
a valuable property. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) wrote for magazines, and brought out some
book of his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) own almost annually. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) head above water, and
was regarded by those who knew about him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>), but did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>), as
a successful man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always kept up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spirits, and was able in
literary circles to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hold his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
driven by the stress of circumstances to take such good things as
came in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, and could hardly afford to be independent. It must
be confessed that literary scruple had long departed from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.
Letter No. 2 was as follows;--


<p/>Welbeck Street,
25th February, 187--.

<p/>DEAR MR. BOOKER,--

<p/>I have told Mr. Leadham---LSB-Mr. Leadham was senior partner
in the enterprising firm of publishers known as Messrs.
Leadham and Loiter-RSB---to send you an early copy of my
<div class="bookquote">``Criminal Queens.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leadham/Leadham</b></font>)</div>I have already settled with my friend
Mr. Broune that I am to do your <div class="bookquote">``New Tale of a Tub''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in
the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Indeed, I am about it now, and
am taking great pains with it. If there is anything
you wish to have specially said as to your view of the
Protestantism of the time, let me know. I should like you
to say a word as to the accuracy of my historical details,
which I know you can safely do. Don't put it off, as the
sale does so much depend on early notices. I am only
getting a royalty, which does not commence till the first
four hundred are sold.

<p/>Yours sincerely,

<p/>MATILDA CARBURY.

<p/>ALFRED BOOKER, Esq.,
<div class="bookquote">``Literary Chronicle,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Office, Strand.


<p/>There was nothing in this which shocked Mr. Booker. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) laughed
inwardly, with a pleasantly reticent chuckle, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) thought of Lady
Carbury dealing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) views of Protestantism,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) thought also
of the numerous historical errors into which that clever lady must
inevitably fall in writing about matters of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to
know nothing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) was quite alive to the fact that a favourable
notice in the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) very thoughtful work, called
the <div class="bookquote">``New Tale of a Tub,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>), even though written by the
hand of a female literary charlatan, and he (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) would have no compunction
as to repaying the service by fulsome praise in the <div class="bookquote">``Literary
Chronicle.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) would not probably say that the book was accurate,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) would be able to declare that it was delightful reading, that
the feminine characteristics of the queens had been touched with a
masterly hand, and that the work was one which would certainly make
its way into all drawing-rooms. He (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) was an adept at this sort of work,
and knew well how to review such a book as Lady Carbury's <div class="bookquote">``Criminal
Queens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>without bestowing much trouble on the reading. He (<font color='blue'><b>charlatan</b></font>) could
almost do it without cutting the book, so that its value for purposes
of after sale might not be injured. And yet Mr. Booker was an
honest man, and had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) face persistently against many literary
malpractices. Stretched-out type, insufficient lines, and the French
habit of meandering with a few words over an entire page, had been
rebuked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) with conscientious strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) was supposed to be
rather an Aristides among reviewers. But circumstanced as he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>)
could not oppose himself altogether to the usages of the time. <div class="bookquote">``Bad;
of course it is bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) said to a young friend who was working with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) periodical. <div class="bookquote">``Who doubts that? How many very bad things are
there that we do! But if we were to attempt to reform all our bad
ways at once, we should never do any good thing. I am not strong
enough to put the world straight, and I doubt if you are.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>Such was
Mr. Booker.

<p/>Then there was letter No. 3, to Mr. Ferdinand Alf. Mr. Alf managed,
and, as it was supposed, chiefly owned, the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>which
during the last two years had become <div class="bookquote">``quite a property,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>as men
connected with the press were in the habit of saying. The <div class="bookquote">``Evening
Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>readers</b></font>)</div>was supposed to give daily to its readers all that had been
said and done up to two o'clock in the day by all the leading people
in the metropolis, and to prophesy with wonderful accuracy what would
be the sayings and doings of the twelve following hours. This was
effected with an air of wonderful omniscience, and not unfrequently
with an ignorance hardly surpassed by its arrogance. But the
writing was clever. The facts, if not true, were well invented; the
arguments, if not logical, were seductive. The presiding spirit of
the paper had the gift, at any rate, of knowing what the people for
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) catered would like to read, and how to get his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) subjects
handled, so that the reading should be pleasant. Mr. Booker's
<div class="bookquote">``Literary Chronicle''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>did not presume to entertain any special
political opinions. The <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was decidedly Liberal. The
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was much given to politics, but held strictly to the
motto which it had assumed;--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri;'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>and consequently had at all times the invaluable privilege of abusing
what was being done, whether by one side or by the other. A newspaper
that wishes to make its fortune should never waste its columns and
weary its readers by praising anything. Eulogy is invariably dull,--a
fact that Mr. Alf had discovered and had utilized.

<p/>Mr. Alf had, moreover, discovered another fact. Abuse from those who
occasionally praise is considered to be personally offensive, and
they who give personal offence will sometimes make the world too
hot to hold them. But censure from those who are always finding
fault is regarded so much as a matter of course that it ceases to be
objectionable. The caricaturist, who draws only caricatures, is held
to be justifiable, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) take what liberties he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) may with a man's
face and person. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) trade, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) business calls upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) to
vilify all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) touches. But were an artist to publish a series of
portraits, in which two out of a dozen were made to be hideous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
would certainly make two enemies, if not more. Mr. Alf never made
enemies, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) praised no one, and, as far as the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
newspaper went, was satisfied with nothing.

<p/>Personally, Mr. Alf was a remarkable man. No one knew whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) came
or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) had been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) was supposed to have been born a German Jew;
and certain ladies said that they could distinguish in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) tongue the
slightest possible foreign accent. Nevertheless it was conceded to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) knew England as only an Englishman can know it. During
the last year or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``come up''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the phrase goes, and had
come up very thoroughly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had been black-balled at three or four
clubs, but had effected an entrance at two or three others, and
had learned a manner of speaking of those which had rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)
calculated to leave on the minds of hearers a conviction that the
societies in question were antiquated, imbecile, and moribund. He (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>)
was never weary of implying that not to know Mr. Alf, not to be on
good terms with Mr. Alf, not to understand that let Mr. Alf have been
born where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) might and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) might he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) was always to be recognised
as a desirable acquaintance, was to be altogether out in the dark.
And that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) so constantly asserted, or implied, men and
women around him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) began at last to believe,--and Mr. Alf became an
acknowledged something in the different worlds of politics, letters,
and fashion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) was a good-looking man, about forty years old, but carrying
himself as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) was much younger, spare, below the middle
height, with dark brown hair which would have shown a tinge of
grey but for the dyer's art, with well-cut features, with a smile
constantly on his (<font color='blue'><b>dyer</b></font>) mouth the pleasantness of which was always belied
by the sharp severity of his (<font color='blue'><b>dyer</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>dyer</b></font>) dressed with the utmost
simplicity, but also with the utmost care. He (<font color='blue'><b>dyer</b></font>) was unmarried, had
a small house of his (<font color='blue'><b>dyer</b></font>) own close to Berkeley Square at which he (<font color='blue'><b>dyer</b></font>)
gave remarkable dinner parties, kept four or five hunters in
Northamptonshire, and was reputed to earn #6,000 a year out of the
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>hunters</b></font>)</div>and to spend about half of that income. He (<font color='blue'><b>dyer</b></font>) also was
intimate after his (<font color='blue'><b>dyer</b></font>) fashion with Lady Carbury, whose diligence in
making and fostering useful friendships had been unwearied. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
letter to Mr. Alf was as follows;--


<p/>DEAR MR. ALF,--

<p/>Do tell me who wrote the review on Fitzgerald Barker's
last poem. Only I know you won't. I remember nothing done
so well. I should think the poor wretch will hardly hold
his (<font color='blue'><b>ALF</b></font>) head up again before the autumn. But it was fully
deserved. I have no patience with the pretensions of
would-be poets who contrive by toadying and underground
influences to get their volumes placed on every
drawing-room table. I know no one to whom the world has
been so good-natured in this way as to Fitzgerald Barker,
but I have heard of no one who has extended the good
nature to the length of reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) poetry.

<p/>Is it not singular how some men continue to obtain the
reputation of popular authorship without adding a word
to the literature of their country worthy of note? It is
accomplished by unflagging assiduity in the system of
puffing. To puff and to get one's self puffed have become
different branches of a new profession. Alas, me! I wish
I might find a class open in which lessons could be taken
by such a poor tyro as myself. Much as I hate the thing
from my very soul, and much as I admire the consistency
with which the <div class="bookquote">``Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>has opposed it, I myself am so
much in want of support for my own little efforts, and
am struggling so hard honestly to make for myself a
remunerative career, that I think, were the opportunity
offered to me, I should pocket my honour, lay aside the
high feeling which tells me that praise should be bought
neither by money nor friendship, and descend among the low
things, in order that I might one day have the pride of
feeling that I had succeeded by my own work in providing
for the needs of my children.

<p/>But I have not as yet commenced the descent downwards;
and therefore I am still bold enough to tell you that I
shall look, not with concern but with a deep interest,
to anything which may appear in the <div class="bookquote">``Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>respecting
my <div class="bookquote">``Criminal Queens.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I venture to think that the
book,--though I wrote it myself,--has an importance of
its own which will secure for it some notice. That my
inaccuracy will be laid bare and presumption scourged I do
not in the least doubt, but I think your reviewer will be
able to certify that the sketches are life-like and the
portraits well considered. You will not hear me told,
at any rate, that I had better sit at home and darn
my stockings, as you said the other day of that poor
unfortunate Mrs. Effington Stubbs.

<p/>I have not seen you for the last three weeks. I have a few
friends every Tuesday evening;--pray come next week or
the week following. And pray believe that no amount of
editorial or critical severity shall make me receive you
otherwise than with a smile.

<p/>Most sincerely yours,

<p/>MATILDA CARBURY.


<p/>Lady Carbury, having finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) third letter, threw herself back
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) chair, and for a moment or two closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes, as though
about to rest. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) soon remembered that the activity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life
did not admit of such rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) therefore seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) pen and began
scribbling further notes.




<p/>CHAPTER II.

<p/>THE CARBURY FAMILY.


<p/>Something of herself and condition Lady Carbury has told the reader
in the letters given in the former chapter, but more must be added.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) has declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been cruelly slandered; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) has also
shown that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was not a woman whose words about herself could be
taken with much confidence. If the reader does not understand so much
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) letters to the three editors they have been written in vain.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) has been made to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) object in work was to provide for
the need of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) children, and that with that noble purpose before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was struggling to make for herself a career in literature.
Detestably false as had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) letters to the editors, absolutely
and abominably foul as was the entire system by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was
endeavouring to achieve success, far away from honour and honesty as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been carried by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ready subserviency to the dirty things
among which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had lately fallen, nevertheless her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) statements about
herself were substantially true. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been ill-treated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
been slandered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) children,--especially devoted to
one of them,--and was ready to work her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) nails off if by doing so she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
could advance their interests.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was the widow of one Sir Patrick Carbury, who many years since
had done great things as a soldier in India, and had been thereupon
created a baronet. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had married a young wife late in life and,
having found out when too late that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had made a mistake, had
occasionally spoilt his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) darling and occasionally ill used her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). In
doing each he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had done it abundantly. Among Lady Carbury's faults
had never been that of even incipient,--not even of sentimental
infidelity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) husband. When as a very lovely and penniless girl
of eighteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had consented to marry a man of forty-four who had
the spending of a large income, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind to abandon
all hope of that sort of love which poets describe and which young
people generally desire to experience. Sir Patrick at the time of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) marriage was red-faced, stout, bald, very choleric, generous in
money, suspicious in temper, and intelligent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) knew how to govern
men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) could read and understand a book. There was nothing mean
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) attractive qualities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) was a man who might
be loved;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) was hardly a man for love. The young Lady Carbury
had understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) position and had determined to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) duty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had resolved before she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) went to the altar that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would never allow
herself to flirt and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had never flirted. For fifteen years things
had gone tolerably well with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),--by which it is intended that the
reader should understand that they had so gone that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been able
to tolerate them. They had been home in England for three or four
years, and then Sir Patrick had returned with some new and higher
appointment. For fifteen years, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) had been passionate,
imperious, and often cruel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) had never been jealous. A boy and
a girl had been born to them, to whom both father and mother had
been over indulgent;--but the mother, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lights, had
endeavoured to do her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) duty by them. But from the commencement of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
life she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been educated in deceit, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) married life had seemed
to make the practice of deceit necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother had run
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been tossed to and fro between
this and that protector, sometimes being in danger of wanting any
one to care for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), till she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been made sharp, incredulous,
and untrustworthy by the difficulties of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) position. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
clever, and had picked up an education and good manners amidst the
difficulties of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) childhood,--and had been beautiful to look at.
To marry and have the command of money, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) duty correctly, to
live in a big house and be respected, had been her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ambition,--and
during the first fifteen years of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) married life she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was successful
amidst great difficulties. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would smile within five minutes of
violent ill-usage. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband would even strike her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),--and the first
effort of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind would be given to conceal the fact from all the
world. In latter years he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) drank too much, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) struggled hard
first to prevent the evil, and then to prevent and to hide the ill
effects of the evil. But in doing all this she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) schemed, and lied, and
lived a life of manoeuvres. Then, at last, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was no longer quite a young woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) allowed herself to attempt to
form friendships for herself, and among her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends was one of the
other sex. If fidelity in a wife be compatible with such friendship,
if the married state does not exact from a woman the necessity of
debarring herself from all friendly intercourse with any man except
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lord, Lady Carbury was not faithless. But Sir Carbury became
jealous, spoke words which even she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not endure, did things
which drove even her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) beyond the calculations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) prudence,--and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But even this she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did in so guarded a way that, as to
every step she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) took, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) innocence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life at that
period is of little moment to our story, except that it is essential
that the reader should know in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been slandered. For
a month or two all hard words had been said against her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
husband's friends, and even by Sir Patrick himself. But gradually
the truth was known, and after a year's separation they came again
together and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) remained the mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) house till he (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) died. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) home to England, but during the short period left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>)
of life in his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) old country he (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) had been a worn-out, dying invalid.
But the scandal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) great misfortune had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), and some
people were never tired of reminding others that in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
married life Lady Carbury had run away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) husband, and had been
taken back again by the kind-hearted old gentleman.

<p/>Sir Patrick had left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) a moderate fortune, though by no
means great wealth. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) son, who was now Sir Felix Carbury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) had
left #1,000 a year; and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) widow as much, with a provision that
after her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) death the latter sum should be divided between his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) son
and daughter. It therefore came to pass that the young man, who had
already entered the army when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father died, and upon whom devolved
no necessity of keeping a house, and who in fact not unfrequently
lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's house, had an income equal to that with which
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister were obliged to maintain a roof over their
head. Now Lady Carbury, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was released from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thraldom
at the age of forty, had no idea at all of passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) future
life amidst the ordinary penances of widowhood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had hitherto
endeavoured to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) duty, knowing that in accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) position
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was bound to take the good and the bad together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
certainly encountered hitherto much that was bad. To be scolded,
watched, beaten, and sworn at by a choleric old man till she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was at
last driven out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) house by the violence of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ill-usage; to be
taken back as a favour with the assurance that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) name would for
the remainder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life be unjustly tarnished; to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) flight
constantly thrown in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) face; and then at last to become for a year
or two the nurse of a dying debauchee, was a high price to pay for
such good things as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had hitherto enjoyed. Now at length had come
to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) a period of relaxation--her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) reward, her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) freedom, her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) chance of
happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) thought much about herself, and resolved on one or two
things. The time for love had gone by, and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would have nothing
to do with it. Nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) marry again for convenience. But she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
would have friends,--real friends; friends who could help her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>),--and
whom possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) might help. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would, too, make some career for
herself, so that life might not be without an interest to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
would live in London, and would become somebody at any rate in some
circle. Accident at first rather than choice had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) among
literary people, but that accident had, during the last two years,
been supported and corroborated by the desire which had fallen upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) of earning money. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had known from the first that economy
would be necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>),--not chiefly or perhaps not at all from a
feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) daughter could not live comfortably together
on a thousand a year,--but on behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) wanted no luxury
but a house so placed that people might conceive of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
lived in a proper part of the town. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) daughter's prudence she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
was as well convinced as of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could trust Henrietta in
everything. But her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) son, Sir Felix, was not very trustworthy. And yet
Sir Felix was the darling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) heart.

<p/>At the time of the writing of the three letters, at which our story
is supposed to begin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was driven very hard for money. Sir Felix
was then twenty-five, had been in a fashionable regiment for four
years, had already sold out, and, to own the truth at once, had
altogether wasted the property which his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father had left him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). So much
the mother knew,--and knew, therefore, that with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) limited income
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must maintain not only herself and daughter, but also the
baronet. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not know, however, the amount of the baronet's
obligations;--nor, indeed, did he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), or any one else. A baronet,
holding a commission in the Guards, and known to have had a fortune
left him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, may go very far in getting into debt; and Sir
Felix had made full use of all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) privileges. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) life had been in
every way bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had become a burden on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother so heavy,--and
on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sister also,--that their life had become one of unavoidable
embarrassments. But not for a moment had either of them ever
quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). Henrietta had been taught by the conduct of both
father and mother that every vice might be forgiven in a man and in
a son, though every virtue was expected from a woman, and especially
from a daughter. The lesson had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) so early in life that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
had learned it without the feeling of any grievance. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lamented
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brother's evil conduct as it affected him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pardoned it
altogether as it affected herself. That all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) interests in life
should be made subservient to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
found that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) little comforts were discontinued, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) moderate
expenses curtailed because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), having eaten up all that was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
own, was now eating up also all that was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother's, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never
complained. Henrietta had been taught to think that men in that rank
of life in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had been born always did eat up everything.

<p/>The mother's feeling was less noble,--or perhaps, it might better
be said, more open to censure. The boy, who had been beautiful as a
star, had ever been the cynosure of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, the one thing on which
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart had rivetted itself. Even during the career of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) folly
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had hardly ventured to say a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with the purport of
stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) road to ruin. In everything she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had spoilt him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
as a boy, and in everything she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still spoilt him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as a man. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
almost proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) vices, and had taken delight in hearing of doings
which if not vicious of themselves had been ruinous from their
extravagance. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had so indulged him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that even in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own presence
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was never ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own selfishness or apparently conscious
of the injustice which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did to others.

<p/>From all this it had come to pass that that dabbling in literature
which had been commenced partly perhaps from a sense of pleasure in
the work, partly as a passport into society, had been converted into
hard work by which money if possible might be earned. So that Lady
Carbury when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friends, the editors, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) struggles
was speaking the truth. Tidings had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) of this and the other
man's success, and,--coming near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) still,--of this and that
other woman's earnings in literature. And it had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that,
within moderate limits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might give a wide field to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hopes. Why
should she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) not add a thousand a year to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) income, so that Felix
might again live like a gentleman and marry that heiress who, in Lady
Carbury's look-out into the future, was destined to make all things
straight! Who was so handsome as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son? Who could make himself more
agreeable? Who had more of that audacity which is the chief thing
necessary to the winning of heiresses? And then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could make his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
wife Lady Carbury. If only enough money might be earned to tide over
the present evil day, all might be well.

<p/>The one most essential obstacle to the chance of success in all
this was probably Lady Carbury's conviction that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) end was to
be obtained not by producing good books, but by inducing certain
people to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) books were good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did work hard at what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wrote,--hard enough at any rate to cover her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) pages quickly;
and was, by nature, a clever woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could write after a glib,
common-place, sprightly fashion, and had already acquired the knack
of spreading all she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew very thin, so that it might cover a vast
surface. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had no ambition to write a good book, but was painfully
anxious to write a book that the critics should say was good. Had Mr.
Broune, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) closet, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) book was absolutely trash,
but had undertaken at the same time to have it violently praised in
the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>it may be doubted whether the critic's own
opinion would have even wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) vanity. The woman was false from
head to foot, but there was much of good in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), false though she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was.

<p/>Whether Sir Felix, her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) son, had become what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was solely by bad
training, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had been born bad, who shall say? It is
hardly possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should not have been better had he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) been taken
away as an infant and subjected to moral training by moral teachers.
And yet again it is hardly possible that any training or want of
training should have produced a heart so utterly incapable of feeling
for others as was his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could not even feel his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own misfortunes
unless they touched the outward comforts of the moment. It seemed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lacked sufficient imagination to realise future misery though
the futurity to be considered was divided from the present but by
a single month, a single week,--but by a single night. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) liked to
be kindly treated, to be praised and petted, to be well fed and
caressed; and they who so treated him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) were his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) chosen friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
had in this the instincts of a horse, not approaching the higher
sympathies of a dog. But it cannot be said of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had
ever loved any one to the extent of denying himself a moment's
gratification on that loved one's behalf. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart was a stone. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was beautiful to look at, ready-witted, and intelligent. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
very dark, with that soft olive complexion which so generally gives
to young men an appearance of aristocratic breeding. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hair, which
was never allowed to become long, was nearly black, and was soft
and silky without that taint of grease which is so common with
silken-headed darlings. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes were long, brown in colour, and
were made beautiful by the perfect arch of the perfect eyebrow. But
perhaps the glory of the face was due more to the finished moulding
and fine symmetry of the nose and mouth than to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) other features.
On his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) short upper lip he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had a moustache as well formed as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
eyebrows, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wore no other beard. The form of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) chin too was
perfect, but it lacked that sweetness and softness of expression,
indicative of softness of heart, which a dimple conveys. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was about
five feet nine in height, and was as excellent in figure as in face.
It was admitted by men and clamorously asserted by women that no man
had ever been more handsome than Felix Carbury, and it was admitted
also that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never showed consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beauty. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given
himself airs on many scores;--on the score of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, poor fool,
while it lasted; on the score of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) title; on the score of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) army
standing till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost it; and especially on the score of superiority
in fashionable intellect. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been clever enough to dress
himself always with simplicity and to avoid the appearance of thought
about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outward man. As yet the little world of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) associates had
hardly found out how callous were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affections,--or rather how
devoid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was of affection. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) airs and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance, joined with
some cleverness, had carried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through even the viciousness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. In one matter he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had marred his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name, and by a moment's
weakness had injured his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
done by the folly of three years. There had been a quarrel between
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and a brother officer, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been the aggressor; and,
when the moment came in which a man's heart should have produced
manly conduct, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had first threatened and had then shown the white
feather. That was now a year since, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had partly outlived the
evil;--but some men still remembered that Felix Carbury had been
cowed, and had cowered.

<p/>It was now his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business to marry an heiress. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was well aware that
it was so, and was quite prepared to face his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) destiny. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lacked
something in the art of making love. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was beautiful, had the
manners of a gentleman, could talk well, lacked nothing of audacity,
and had no feeling of repugnance at declaring a passion which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
not feel. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew so little of the passion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly
make even a young girl believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked of
love, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not only thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking nonsense, but showed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought so. From this fault he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already failed with one
young lady reputed to have #40,000, who had refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) because, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) naively said, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not really care.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can I show
that I care more than by wishing to make you my wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know that you can, but all the same you don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
said. And so that young lady escaped the pit-fall. Now there was
another young lady, to whom the reader shall be introduced in time,
whom Sir Felix was instigated to pursue with unremitting diligence.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) wealth was not defined, as had been the #40,000 of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
predecessor, but was known to be very much greater than that. It was,
indeed, generally supposed to be fathomless, bottomless, endless.
It was said that in regard to money for ordinary expenditure, money
for houses, servants, horses, jewels, and the like, one sum was
the same as another to the father of this young lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had great
concerns;--concerns so great that the payment of ten or twenty
thousand pounds upon any trifle was the same thing to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),--as to men
who are comfortable in their circumstances it matters little whether
they pay sixpence or ninepence for their mutton chops. Such a man
may be ruined at any time; but there was no doubt that to any one
marrying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter during the present season of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outrageous
prosperity he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could give a very large fortune indeed. Lady Carbury,
who had known the rock on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son had been once wrecked, was
very anxious that Sir Felix should at once make a proper use of the
intimacy which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had effected in the house of this topping Croesus
of the day.

<p/>And now there must be a few words said about Henrietta Carbury. Of
course she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was of infinitely less importance than her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) brother, who
was a baronet, the head of that branch of the Carburys, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
mother's darling; and, therefore, a few words should suffice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
also was very lovely, being like her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) brother; but somewhat less
dark and with features less absolutely regular. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
countenance a full measure of that sweetness of expression which
seems to imply that consideration of self is subordinated to
consideration for others. This sweetness was altogether lacking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) brother. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) face was a true index of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) character. Again,
who shall say why the brother and sister had become so opposite to
each other; whether they would have been thus different had both been
taken away as infants from their father's and mother's training, or
whether the girl's virtues were owing altogether to the lower place
which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had held in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parent's heart? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), at any rate, had
not been spoilt by a title, by the command of money, and by the
temptations of too early acquaintance with the world. At the present
time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was barely twenty-one years old, and had not seen much of
London society. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother did not frequent balls, and during the
last two years there had grown upon them a necessity for economy
which was inimical to many gloves and costly dresses. Sir Felix went
out of course, but Hetta Carbury spent most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) time at home with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mother in Welbeck Street. Occasionally the world saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), and
when the world did see her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) the world declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was a charming
girl. The world was so far right.

<p/>But for Henrietta Carbury the romance of life had already commenced
in real earnest. There was another branch of the Carburys, the head
branch, which was now represented by one Roger Carbury, of Carbury
Hall. Roger Carbury was a gentleman of whom much will have to be
said, but here, at this moment, it need only be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was
passionately in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin Henrietta. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was, however,
nearly forty years old, and there was one Paul Montague whom
Henrietta had seen.




<p/>CHAPTER III.

<p/>THE BEARGARDEN.


<p/>Lady Carbury's house in Welbeck Street was a modest house
enough,--with no pretensions to be a mansion, hardly assuming even
to be a residence; but, having some money in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hands when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
first took it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had made it pretty and pleasant, and was still
proud to feel that in spite of the hardness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) position she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
comfortable belongings around her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) literary friends came to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) Tuesday evenings. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was now living with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son
and daughter. The back drawing-room was divided from the front by
doors that were permanently closed, and in this she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) carried on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
great work. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) books and contrived her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) system for the
inveigling of editors and critics. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was rarely disturbed by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter, and admitted no visitors except editors and critics.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son was controlled by no household laws, and would break
in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) privacy without remorse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had hardly finished two
galloping notes after completing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) letter to Mr. Ferdinand Alf,
when Felix entered the room with a cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) mouth and threw
himself upon the sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``pray leave your tobacco below when you come

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What affectation it is, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) said, throwing, however, the
half-smoked cigar into the fire-place. <div class="bookquote">``Some women swear they like
smoke, others say they hate it like the devil. It depends altogether
on whether they wish to flatter or snub a fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I don't know. I wonder whether you can let me have
twenty pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Felix!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, mother;--but how about the twenty pounds?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it for, Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--to tell the truth, to carry on the game for the nonce till
something is settled. A fellow can't live without some money in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
pocket. I do with as little as most fellows. I pay for nothing that
I can help. I even get my hair cut on credit, and as long as it was
possible I had a brougham, to save cabs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to be the end of it, Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never could see the end of anything, mother. I never could nurse
a horse when the hounds were going well in order to be in at the
finish. I never could pass a dish that I liked in favour of those
that were to follow. What's the use?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man did not say
<div class="bookquote">``carpe diem,''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>but that was the philosophy which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to
preach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been at the Melmottes' to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>It was now five o'clock on
a winter afternoon, the hour at which ladies are drinking tea, and
idle men playing whist at the clubs,--at which young idle men are
sometimes allowed to flirt, and at which, as Lady Carbury thought,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son might have been paying his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) court to Marie Melmotte the great
heiress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just come away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you think of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell the truth, mother, I have thought very little about her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is not pretty, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is not plain; she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is not clever, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is not
stupid; she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is neither saint nor sinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The more likely to make a good wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so. I am at any rate quite willing to believe that as wife
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would be `good enough for me.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does the mother say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The mother is a caution. I cannot help speculating whether, if I
marry the daughter, I shall ever find out where the mother came from.
Dolly Longestaffe says that somebody says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was a Bohemian
Jewess; but I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)'s too fat for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter, Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) civil to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, civil enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does not turn me out, or anything of that sort. Of course
there are half-a-dozen after her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), and I think the old fellow is
bewildered among them all. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s thinking more of getting dukes to
dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) than of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) daughter's lovers. Any fellow might pick
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) up who happened to hit her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, mother? I am doing my best, and it's no good flogging a
willing horse. Can you let me have the money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix, I think you hardly know how poor we are. You have still
got your hunters down at the place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have got two horses, if you mean that; and I haven't paid a
shilling for their keep since the season began. Look here, mother;
this is a risky sort of game, I grant, but I am playing it by your
advice. If I can marry Miss Melmotte, I suppose all will be right.
But I don't think the way to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be to throw up everything
and let all the world know that I haven't got a copper. To do that
kind of thing a man must live a little up to the mark. I've brought
my hunting down to a minimum, but if I gave it up altogether there
would be lots of fellows to tell them in Grosvenor Square why I had
done so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an apparent truth in this argument which the poor woman was
unable to answer. Before the interview was over the money demanded
was forthcoming, though at the time it could be but ill afforded, and
the youth went away apparently with a light heart, hardly listening
to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother's entreaties that the affair with Marie Melmotte might,
if possible, be brought to a speedy conclusion.

<p/>Felix, when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, went down to the only club to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) now belonged. Clubs are pleasant resorts in all respects but one.
They require ready money, or even worse than that in respect to
annual payments,--money in advance; and the young baronet had been
absolutely forced to restrict himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), as a matter of course, out
of those to which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had possessed the right of entrance, chose the
worst. It was called the Beargarden, and had been lately opened with
the express view of combining parsimony with profligacy. Clubs were
ruined, so said certain young parsimonious profligates, by providing
comforts for old fogies who paid little or nothing but their
subscriptions, and took out by their mere presence three times as
much as they gave. This club was not to be opened till three o'clock
in the afternoon, before which hour the promoters of the Beargarden
thought it improbable that they and their fellows would want a
club. There were to be no morning papers taken, no library, no
morning-room. Dining-rooms, billiard-rooms, and card-rooms would
suffice for the Beargarden. Everything was to be provided by a
purveyor, so that the club should be cheated only by one man.
Everything was to be luxurious, but the luxuries were to be achieved
at first cost. It had been a happy thought, and the club was said to
prosper. Herr Vossner, the purveyor, was a jewel, and so carried on
affairs that there was no trouble about anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) would assist
even in smoothing little difficulties as to the settling of card
accounts, and had behaved with the greatest tenderness to the drawers
of cheques whose bankers had harshly declared them to have <div class="bookquote">``no
effects.''  (<font color='red'><b>bankers</b></font>)</div>Herr Vossner was a jewel, and the Beargarden was a
success. Perhaps no young man about town enjoyed the Beargarden more
thoroughly than did Sir Felix Carbury. The club was in the close
vicinity of other clubs, in a small street turning out of St. James's
Street, and piqued itself on its outward quietness and sobriety. Why
pay for stone-work for other people to look at;--why lay out money
in marble pillars and cornices, seeing that you can neither eat such
things, nor drink them, nor gamble with them? But the Beargarden had
the best wines,--or thought that it had,--and the easiest chairs, and
two billiard-tables than which nothing more perfect had ever been
made to stand upon legs. Hither Sir Felix wended on that January
afternoon as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mother's cheque for #20 in his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
pocket.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) special friend, Dolly Longestaffe, standing on the steps
with a cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mouth, and gazing vacantly at the dull brick
house opposite. <div class="bookquote">``Going to dine here, Dolly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I shall, because it's such a lot of trouble to go anywhere
else. I'm engaged somewhere, I know; but I'm not up to getting home
and dressing. By George! I don't know how fellows do that kind of
thing. I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to hunt to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; but I don't suppose I shall. I was going to hunt every
day last week, but my fellow never would get me up in time. I can't
tell why it is that things are done in such a beastly way. Why
shouldn't fellows begin to hunt at two or three, so that a fellow
needn't get up in the middle of the night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because one can't ride by moonlight, Dolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't moonlight at three. At any rate I can't get myself to
Euston Square by nine. I don't think that fellow of mine likes
getting up himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes in and wakes me, but I never
remember it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many horses have you got at Leighton, Dolly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many? There were five, but I think that fellow down there sold
one; but then I think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) bought another. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who rides them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) does, I suppose. That is, of course, I ride them myself, only I
so seldom get down. Somebody told me that Grasslough was riding two
of them last week. I don't think I ever told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) might. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
tipped that fellow of mine; and I call that a low kind of thing to
do. I'd ask him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), only I know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d say that I had lent them. Perhaps
I did when I was tight, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You and Grasslough were never pals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) a bit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) gives himself airs because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) is a lord,
and is devilish ill-natured. I don't know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) should want to ride
my horses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To save his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) isn't hard up. Why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) own horses? I'll tell you
what, Carbury, I've made up my mind to one thing, and, by Jove, I'll
stick to it. I never will lend a horse again to anybody. If fellows
want horses let them buy them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But some fellows haven't got any money, Dolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they ought to go tick. I don't think I've paid for any of mine
I've bought this season. There was somebody here yesterday--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! here at the club?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; followed me here to say he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wanted to be paid for something! It
was horses, I think, because of the fellow's trousers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! Oh, I didn't say anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how did it end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d done talking I offered him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a cigar, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was
biting off the end I went up-stairs. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went away when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
was tired of waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what, Dolly; I wish you'd let me ride two of yours
for a couple of days,--that is, of course, if you don't want them
yourself. You ain't tight now, at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I ain't tight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, with melancholy acquiescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that I wouldn't like to borrow your horses without your
remembering all about it. Nobody knows as well as you do how awfully
done up I am. I shall pull through at last, but it's an awful squeeze
in the meantime. There's nobody I'd ask such a favour of except you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you may have them;--that is, for two days. I don't know
whether that fellow of mine will believe you. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wouldn't believe
Grasslough, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) so. But Grasslough took them out of the
stables. That's what somebody told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could write a line to your groom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear fellow, that is such a bore; I don't think I could do
that. My fellow will believe you, because you and I have been pals.
I think I'll have a little drop of curaçoa before dinner. Come along
and try it. It'll give us an appetite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was then nearly seven o'clock. Nine hours afterwards the same
two men, with two others,--of whom young Lord Grasslough, Dolly
Longestaffe's peculiar aversion, was one,--were just rising from a
card-table in one of the up-stairs rooms of the club. For it was
understood that, though the Beargarden was not to be open before
three o'clock in the afternoon, the accommodation denied during
the day was to be given freely during the night. No man could get
a breakfast at the Beargarden, but suppers at three o'clock in
the morning were quite within the rule. Such a supper, or rather
succession of suppering, there had been to-night, various devils and
broils and hot toasts having been brought up from time to time first
for one and then for another. But there had been no cessation of
gambling since the cards had first been opened about ten o'clock. At
four in the morning Dolly Longestaffe was certainly in a condition
to lend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horses and to remember nothing about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite
affectionate with Lord Grasslough, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was also with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) other
companions,--affection being the normal state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) mind when
in that condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was by no means helplessly drunk, and was,
perhaps, hardly more silly than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was sober; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was willing
to play at any game whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) understood it or not, and for any
stakes. When Sir Felix got up and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) would play no more, Dolly
also got up, apparently quite contented. When Lord Grasslough, with
a dark scowl on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) face, expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) opinion that it was not
just the thing for men to break up like that when so much money had
been lost, Dolly as willingly sat down again. But Dolly's sitting
down was not sufficient. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to hunt to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir
Felix,--meaning that day,--<div class="bookquote">``and I shall play no more. A man must go
to bed at some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Lord Grasslough. <div class="bookquote">``It's an understood
thing that when a man has won as much as you have he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay how long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, with an angry look. <div class="bookquote">``That's
nonsense; there must be an end of everything, and there's an end of
this for me to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you choose,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) lordship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do choose. Good night, Dolly; we'll settle this next time we meet.
I've got it all entered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>The night had been one very serious in its results to Sir Felix. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
had sat down to the card-table with the proceeds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) mother's
cheque, a poor #20, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) didn't at all know how much
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) also had drunk, but not so as to obscure his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) mind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) knew that Longestaffe owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) over #800, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) knew also that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had received more than that in ready money and cheques from Lord
Grasslough and the other player. Dolly Longestaffe's money, too,
would certainly be paid, though Dolly did complain of the importunity
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) tradesmen. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) walked up St. James's Street, looking for a
cab, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) presumed himself to be worth over #700. When begging for a
small sum from Lady Carbury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) could not carry
on the game without some ready money, and had considered himself
fortunate in fleecing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) mother as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had done. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was in
the possession of wealth,--of wealth that might, at any rate, be
sufficient to aid him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) materially in the object he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had in hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
never for a moment thought of paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) bills. Even the large sum of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had become so unexpectedly possessed would not have gone far
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) in such a quixotic object as that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) could now look
bright, and buy presents, and be seen with money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) hands. It is
hard even to make love in these days without something in your purse.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) found no cab, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) present frame of mind was indifferent to
the trouble of walking home. There was something so joyous in the
feeling of the possession of all this money that it made the night
air pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>). Then, of a sudden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) remembered the low wail
with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) mother had spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) poverty when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) demanded
assistance from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) could give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back the #20. But it
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) sharply, with an amount of carefulness quite new to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>), that it would be foolish to do so. How soon might he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) want it
again? And, moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) could not repay the money without explaining
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had gotten it. It would be preferable to say nothing
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) money. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) let himself into the house and went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
room he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) would not say anything about it.

<p/>On that morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was at the station at nine, and hunted down in
Buckinghamshire, riding two of Dolly Longestaffe's horses,--for the
use of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) paid Dolly Longestaffe's <div class="bookquote">``fellow''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>thirty shillings.




<p/>CHAPTER IV.

<p/>MADAME MELMOTTE``S BALL.


<p/>The next night but one after that of the gambling transaction at the
Beargarden, a great ball was given in Grosvenor Square. It was a
ball on a scale so magnificent that it had been talked about ever
since Parliament met, now about a fortnight since. Some people had
expressed an opinion that such a ball as this was intended to be
could not be given successfully in February. Others declared that the
money which was to be spent,--an amount which would make this affair
something quite new in the annals of ball-giving,--would give the
thing such a character that it would certainly be successful. And
much more than money had been expended. Almost incredible efforts
had been made to obtain the co-operation of great people, and these
efforts had at last been grandly successful. The Duchess of Stevenage
had come up from Castle Albury herself to be present at it and to
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) daughters, though it has never been her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) Grace's wont to be
in London at this inclement season. No doubt the persuasion used with
the Duchess had been very strong. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) brother, Lord Alfred Grendall,
was known to be in great difficulties, which,--so people said,--had
been considerably modified by opportune pecuniary assistance. And
then it was certain that one of the young Grendalls, Lord Alfred's
second son, had been appointed to some mercantile position, for which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) received a salary which his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) most intimate friends thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
was hardly qualified to earn. It was certainly a fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) went to
Abchurch Lane, in the City, four or five days a week, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) did
not occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) time in so unaccustomed a manner for nothing. Where
the Duchess of Stevenage went all the world would go. And it became
known at the last moment, that is to say only the day before the
party, that a prince of the blood royal was to be there. How this
had been achieved nobody quite understood; but there were rumours
that a certain lady's jewels had been rescued from the pawnbroker's.
Everything was done on the same scale. The Prime Minister had indeed
declined to allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) name to appear on the list; but one Cabinet
Minister and two or three under-secretaries had agreed to come
because it was felt that the giver of the ball might before long be
the master of considerable parliamentary interest. It was believed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had an eye to politics, and it is always wise to have great
wealth on one's own side. There had at one time been much solicitude
about the ball. Many anxious thoughts had been given. When great
attempts fail, the failure is disastrous, and may be ruinous. But
this ball had now been put beyond the chance of failure.

<p/>The giver of the ball was Augustus Melmotte, Esq., the father of the
girl whom Sir Felix Carbury desired to marry, and the husband of the
lady who was said to have been a Bohemian Jewess. It was thus that
the gentleman chose to have himself designated, though within the
last two years he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had arrived in London from Paris, and had at first
been known as M. Melmotte. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had declared of himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
had been born in England, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was an Englishman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) admitted
that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife was a foreigner,--an admission that was necessary as
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spoke very little English. Melmotte himself spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``native''
 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>language fluently, but with an accent which betrayed at least a long
expatriation. Miss Melmotte,--who a very short time since had been
known as Mademoiselle Marie,--spoke English well, but as a foreigner.
In regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) it was acknowledged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been born out of
England,--some said in New York; but Madame Melmotte, who must have
known, had declared that the great event had taken place in Paris.

<p/>It was at any rate an established fact that Mr. Melmotte had made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wealth in France. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) no doubt had had enormous dealings in other
countries, as to which stories were told which must surely have been
exaggerated. It was said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had made a railway across Russia,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) provisioned the Southern army in the American civil war, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had supplied Austria with arms, and had at one time bought up all
the iron in England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could make or mar any company by buying or
selling stock, and could make money dear or cheap as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pleased. All
this was said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) praise,--but it was also said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
was regarded in Paris as the most gigantic swindler that had ever
lived; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had made that City too hot to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
endeavoured to establish himself in Vienna, but had been warned away
by the police; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had at length found that British freedom
would alone allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to enjoy, without persecution, the fruits of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) industry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was now established privately in Grosvenor Square
and officially in Abchurch Lane; and it was known to all the world
that a Royal Prince, a Cabinet Minister, and the very cream of
duchesses were going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife's ball. All this had been done
within twelve months.

<p/>There was but one child in the family, one heiress for all this
wealth. Melmotte himself was a large man, with bushy whiskers and
rough thick hair, with heavy eyebrows, and a wonderful look of power
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mouth and chin. This was so strong as to redeem his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face
from vulgarity; but the countenance and appearance of the man were
on the whole unpleasant, and, I may say, untrustworthy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) looked as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were purse-proud and a bully. She (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) was fat and fair,--unlike
in colour to our traditional Jewesses; but she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) had the Jewish nose
and the Jewish contraction of the eyes. There was certainly very
little in Madame Melmotte to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>), unless it was a readiness
to spend money on any object that might be suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)
new acquaintances. It sometimes seemed that she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) had a commission from
her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) husband to give away presents to any who would accept them. The
world had received the man as Augustus Melmotte, Esq.. The world so
addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) on the very numerous letters which reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and so
inscribed him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) among the directors of three dozen companies to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) belonged. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife was still Madame Melmotte. The daughter had
been allowed to take her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rank with an English title. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was now Miss
Melmotte on all occasions.

<p/>Marie Melmotte had been accurately described by Felix Carbury to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not beautiful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not clever, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not a
saint. But then neither was she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) plain, nor stupid, nor, especially, a
sinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a little thing, hardly over twenty years of age, very
unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father or mother, having no trace of the Jewess in her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
countenance, who seemed to be overwhelmed by the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
position. With such people as the Melmottes things go fast, and it
was very well known that Miss Melmotte had already had one lover
who had been nearly accepted. The affair, however, had gone off.
In this <div class="bookquote">``going off''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>no one imputed to the young lady blame or even
misfortune. It was not supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had either jilted or been
jilted. As in royal espousals interests of State regulate their
expedience with an acknowledged absence, with even a proclaimed
impossibility, of personal predilections, so in this case was money
allowed to have the same weight. Such a marriage would or would not
be sanctioned in accordance with great pecuniary arrangements. The
young Lord Nidderdale, the eldest son of the Marquis of Auld Reekie,
had offered to take the girl and make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Marchioness in the process
of time for half a million down. Melmotte had not objected to the
sum,--so it was said,--but had proposed to tie it up. Nidderdale had
desired to have it free in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) own grasp, and would not move on any
other terms. Melmotte had been anxious to secure the Marquis,--very
anxious to secure the Marchioness; for at that time terms had not
been made with the Duchess; but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) temper, and
had asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lordship's lawyer whether it was likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would
entrust such a sum of money to such a man. <div class="bookquote">``You are willing to trust
your only child to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer. Melmotte scowled at the man
for a few seconds from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bushy eyebrows; then told him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) answer had nothing in it, and marched out of the room. So that
affair was over. I doubt whether Lord Nidderdale had ever said a word
of love to Marie Melmotte,--or whether the poor girl had expected it.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) destiny had no doubt been explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/>Others had tried and had broken down somewhat in the same fashion.
Each had treated the girl as an encumbrance he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was to undertake,--at
a very great price. But as affairs prospered with the Melmottes, as
princes and duchesses were obtained by other means,--costly no doubt,
but not so ruinously costly,--the immediate disposition of Marie
became less necessary, and Melmotte reduced his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) offers. The girl
herself, too, began to have an opinion. It was said that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
absolutely rejected Lord Grasslough, whose father indeed was in a
state of bankruptcy, who had no income of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, who was ugly,
vicious, ill-tempered, and without any power of recommending himself
to a girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had had experience since Lord Nidderdale, with a half
laugh, had told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) might just as well take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
wife, and was now tempted from time to time to contemplate her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own
happiness and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own condition. People around were beginning to say
that if Sir Felix Carbury managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) affairs well he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) might be the
happy man.

<p/>There was considerable doubt whether Marie was the daughter of that
Jewish-looking woman. Enquiries had been made, but not successfully,
as to the date of the Melmotte marriage. There was an idea abroad
that Melmotte had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) first money with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife, and had gotten
it not very long ago. Then other people said that Marie was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
daughter at all. Altogether the mystery was rather pleasant as the
money was certain. Of the certainty of the money in daily use there
could be no doubt. There was the house. There was the furniture.
There were the carriages, the horses, the servants with the livery
coats and powdered heads, and the servants with the black coats and
unpowdered heads. There were the gems, and the presents, and all the
nice things that money can buy. There were two dinner parties every
day, one at two o'clock called lunch, and the other at eight. The
tradesmen had learned enough to be quite free of doubt, and in the
City Mr. Melmotte's name was worth any money,--though his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) character
was perhaps worth but little.

<p/>The large house on the south side of Grosvenor Square was all
ablaze by ten o'clock. The broad verandah had been turned into a
conservatory, had been covered in with boards contrived to look like
trellis-work, was heated with hot air and filled with exotics at
some fabulous price. A covered way had been made from the door, down
across the pathway, to the road, and the police had, I fear, been
bribed to frighten foot passengers into a belief that they were bound
to go round. The house had been so arranged that it was impossible to
know where you were, when once in it. The hall was a paradise. The
staircase was fairyland. The lobbies were grottoes rich with ferns.
Walls had been knocked away and arches had been constructed. The
leads behind had been supported and walled in, and covered and
carpeted. The ball had possession of the ground floor and first
floor, and the house seemed to be endless. <div class="bookquote">``It's to cost sixty
thousand pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marchioness</b></font>)</div>said the Marchioness of Auld Reekie to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) old
friend the Countess of Mid-Lothian. The Marchioness had come in spite
of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) son's misfortune when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heard that the Duchess of Stevenage
was to be there. <div class="bookquote">``And worse spent money never was wasted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>said
the Countess. <div class="bookquote">``By all accounts it was as badly come by,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marchioness</b></font>)</div>said the
Marchioness. Then the two old noblewomen, one after the other, made
graciously flattering speeches to the much-worn Bohemian Jewess, who
was standing in fairyland to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) guests, almost fainting
under the greatness of the occasion.

<p/>The three saloons on the first or drawing-room floor had been
prepared for dancing, and here Marie was stationed. The Duchess
had however undertaken to see that somebody should set the dancing
going, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) had commissioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) nephew Miles Grendall, the young
gentleman who now frequented the City, to give directions to the band
and to make himself generally useful. Indeed there had sprung up a
considerable intimacy between the Grendall family,--that is Lord
Alfred's branch of the Grendalls,--and the Melmottes; which was as
it should be, as each could give much and each receive much. It was
known that Lord Alfred had not a shilling; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) brother was a duke
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) sister was a duchess, and for the last thirty years there
had been one continual anxiety for poor dear Alfred, who had tumbled
into an unfortunate marriage without a shilling, had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) own
moderate patrimony, had three sons and three daughters, and had lived
now for a very long time entirely on the unwilling contributions
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) noble relatives. Melmotte could support the whole family in
affluence without feeling the burden;--and why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) not? There
had once been an idea that Miles should attempt to win the heiress,
but it had soon been found expedient to abandon it. Miles had no
title, no position of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) own, and was hardly big enough for the
place. It was in all respects better that the waters of the fountain
should be allowed to irrigate mildly the whole Grendall family;--and
so Miles went into the city.

<p/>The ball was opened by a quadrille in which Lord Buntingford, the
eldest son of the Duchess, stood up with Marie. Various arrangements
had been made, and this among them. We may say that it had been part
of a bargain. Lord Buntingford had objected mildly, being a young man
devoted to business, fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buntingford</b></font>) own order, rather shy, and not given
to dancing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Buntingford</b></font>) had allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Buntingford</b></font>) mother to prevail. <div class="bookquote">``Of course they
are vulgar,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>the Duchess had said,--<div class="bookquote">``so much so as to be no longer
distasteful because of the absurdity of the thing. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
hasn't been very honest. When men make so much money, I don't know
how they can have been honest. Of course it's done for a purpose.
It's all very well saying that it isn't right, but what are we to do
about Alfred's children? Miles is to have #500 a-year. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) is
always about the house. And between you and me they have got up those
bills of Alfred's, and have said they can lie in their safe till it
suits your uncle to pay them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will lie there a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Buntingford</b></font>)</div>said Lord Buntingford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they expect something in return; do dance with the girl
once.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Buntingford</b></font>)</div>Lord Buntingford disapproved--mildly, and did as his (<font color='blue'><b>Buntingford</b></font>) mother
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Buntingford</b></font>).

<p/>The affair went off very well. There were three or four card-tables
in one of the lower rooms, and at one of them sat Lord Alfred
Grendall and Mr. Melmotte, with two or three other players, cutting
in and out at the end of each rubber. Playing whist was Lord Alfred's
only accomplishment, and almost the only occupation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
began it daily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) club at three o'clock, and continued playing
till two in the morning with an interval of a couple of hours for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
dinner. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) did during ten months of the year, and during the
other two he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) frequented some watering-place at which whist prevailed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) did not gamble, never playing for more than the club stakes and
bets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) gave to the matter his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) whole mind, and must have excelled
those who were generally opposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>). But so obdurate was fortune
to Lord Alfred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) could not make money even of whist. Melmotte
was very anxious to get into Lord Alfred's club,--The Peripatetics.
It was pleasant to see the grace with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) money, and
the sweet intimacy with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) lordship Alfred. Lord
Alfred had a remnant of feeling left, and would have liked to kick
him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>). Though Melmotte was by far the bigger man, and was also the
younger, Lord Alfred would not have lacked the pluck to kick him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>).
Lord Alfred, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) habitual idleness and vapid uselessness,
had still left about him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) a dash of vigour, and sometimes thought that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) would kick Melmotte and have done with it. But there were his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) poor
boys, and those bills in Melmotte's safe. And then Melmotte lost
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) points so regularly, and paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bets with such absolute good
humour! <div class="bookquote">``Come and have a glass of champagne, Alfred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Melmotte
said, as the two cut out together. Lord Alfred liked champagne, and
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) host; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) went he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) almost made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) mind that on
some future day he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) would kick the man.

<p/>Late in the evening Marie Melmotte was waltzing with Felix Carbury,
and Henrietta Carbury was then standing by talking to one Mr. Paul
Montague. Lady Carbury was also there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was not well inclined
either to balls or to such people as the Melmottes; nor was
Henrietta. But Felix had suggested that, bearing in mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
prospects as to the heiress, they had better accept the invitation
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would cause to have sent to them. They did so; and then
Paul Montague also got a card, not altogether to Lady Carbury's
satisfaction. Lady Carbury was very gracious to Madame Melmotte for
two minutes, and then slid into a chair expecting nothing but misery
for the evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), however, was a woman who could do her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) duty and
endure without complaint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the first great ball I ever was at in London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta
Carbury to Paul Montague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. How should I like it? I know nobody here. I don't
understand how it is that at these parties people do know each other,
or whether they all go dancing about without knowing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just that; I suppose when they are used to it they get introduced
backwards and forwards, and then they can know each other as fast as
they like. If you would wish to dance why won't you dance with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have danced with you,--twice already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any law against dancing three times?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't especially want to dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div>said Henrietta. <div class="bookquote">``I think
I'll go and console poor mamma, who has got nobody to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Just at this moment, however, Lady Carbury was not in that wretched
condition, as an unexpected friend had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) relief.

<p/>Sir Felix and Marie Melmotte had been spinning round and round
throughout a long waltz, thoroughly enjoying the excitement of the
music and the movement. To give Felix Carbury what little praise
might be his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) due, it is necessary to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not lack
physical activity. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would dance, and ride, and shoot eagerly, with
an animation that made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) happy for the moment. It was an affair not
of thought or calculation, but of physical organisation. And Marie
Melmotte had been thoroughly happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) loved dancing with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
heart if she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could only dance in a manner pleasant to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had been warned especially as to some men,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should not dance
with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been almost thrown into Lord Nidderdale's arms,
and had been prepared to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father's bidding. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had never had the slightest pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) society, and had only not
been wretched because she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not as yet recognised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had an
identity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own in the disposition of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) herself should
have a voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) certainly had never cared to dance with Lord
Nidderdale. Lord Grasslough she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had absolutely hated, though at first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had hardly dared to say so. One or two others had been obnoxious
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) in different ways, but they had passed on, or were passing on,
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) way. There was no one at the present moment whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
been commanded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father to accept should an offer be made. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did like dancing with Sir Felix Carbury.

<p/>It was not only that the man was handsome but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a power of
changing the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance, a play of face, which
belied altogether his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) real disposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could seem to be hearty
and true till the moment came in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had really to expose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
heart,--or to try to expose it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) failed, knowing nothing
about it. But in the approaches to intimacy with a girl he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
be very successful. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already nearly got beyond this with
Marie Melmotte; but Marie was by no means quick in discovering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
deficiencies. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seemed like a god. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) might be
allowed to be wooed by Sir Felix Carbury, and to give herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would be contented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How well you dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had breath for
speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) spoke with a slightly foreign accent, which gave a little
prettiness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) speech. <div class="bookquote">``I was never told so. But nobody ever told
me anything about myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to tell you everything about yourself, from the
beginning to the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,--but you don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would find out. I think I could make some good guesses. I'll tell
you what you would like best in all the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Somebody that liked you best in all the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,--yes; if one knew who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you know, Miss Melmotte, but by believing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not the way to know. If a girl told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liked me
better than any other girl, I should not know it, just because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
said so. I should have to find it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if a gentleman told you so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't believe him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a bit, and I should not care to find out.
But I should like to have some girl for a friend whom I could love,
oh, ten times better than myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So should I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you no particular friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean a girl whom I could love,--oh, ten times better than myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are laughing at me, Sir Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Melmotte/MISS MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Miss Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether that will come to anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul Montague to
Miss Carbury. They had come back into the drawing-room, and had been
watching the approaches to love-making which the baronet was opening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean Felix and Miss Melmotte. I hate to think of such things,
Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a magnificent chance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To marry a girl, the daughter of vulgar people, just because
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will have a great deal of money? He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) can't care for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
really,--because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wants money so dreadfully! It seems to me that there is no
other condition of things under which Felix can face the world, but
by being the husband of an heiress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a dreadful thing to say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But isn't it true? He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has beggared himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) will beggar you and your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care about myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Others do though.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), but spoke
through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were angry both with himself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not think you would have spoken so harshly of Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't speak harshly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), Miss Carbury. I haven't said that it
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) seems to be one of those who have been born to
spend money; and as this girl will have plenty of money to spend, I
think it would be a good thing if he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) were to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). If Felix had
#20,000 a year, everybody would think him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) the finest fellow in the
world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Montague/Mr. Paul Montague</b></font>)</div>In saying this, however, Mr. Paul Montague showed himself
unfit to gauge the opinion of the world. Whether Sir Felix be rich or
poor, the world, evil-hearted as it is, will never think him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) a fine
fellow.

<p/>Lady Carbury had been seated for nearly half an hour in uncomplaining
solitude under a bust, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was delighted by the appearance of
Mr. Ferdinand Alf. <div class="bookquote">``You here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? Melmotte and I are brother adventurers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought you would find so little here to amuse you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have found you; and, in addition to that, duchesses and their
daughters without number. They expect Prince George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Legge Wilson from the India Office is here already. I spoke to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) in some jewelled bower as I made my way here, not five minutes
since. It's quite a success. Don't you think it very nice, Lady
Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether you are joking or in earnest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never joke. I say it is very nice. These people are spending
thousands upon thousands to gratify you and me and others, and all
they want in return is a little countenance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to give it then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am giving it them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ah;--but the countenance of the ``Evening Pulpit.<div class="bookquote">'' Do you mean to
give them that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; it is not in our line exactly to give a catalogue of names
and to record ladies' dresses. Perhaps it may be better for our host
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should be kept out of the newspapers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to be very severe upon poor me, Mr. Alf?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the
lady after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are never severe upon anybody, Lady Carbury. Here's the Prince.
What will they do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) now they've caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)! Oh, they're going
to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) dance with the heiress. Poor heiress!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Prince!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)'s a nice little girl enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'ll have nothing
to trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). But how is she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>), poor thing, to talk to royal blood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor thing indeed! The Prince was brought into the big room where
Marie was still being talked to by Felix Carbury, and was at once
made to understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was to stand up and dance with royalty.
The introduction was managed in a very business-like manner. Miles
Grendall first came in and found the female victim; the Duchess
followed with the male victim. Madame Melmotte, who had been on her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)
legs till she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was ready to sink, waddled behind, but was not allowed
to take any part in the affair. The band were playing a galop, but
that was stopped at once, to the great confusion of the dancers. In
two minutes Miles Grendall had made up a set. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) stood up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
aunt, the Duchess, as vis-a-vis to Marie and the Prince, till, about
the middle of the quadrille, Legge Wilson was found and made to take
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) place. Lord Buntingford had gone away; but then there were still
present two daughters of the Duchess who were rapidly caught. Sir
Felix Carbury, being good-looking and having a name, was made to
dance with one of them, and Lord Grasslough with the other. There
were four other couples, all made up of titled people, as it was
intended that this special dance should be chronicled, if not in the
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>in some less serious daily journal. A paid reporter
was present in the house ready to rush off with the list as soon as
the dance should be a realized fact. The Prince himself did not quite
understand why he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was there, but they who marshalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) life for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had so marshalled it for the present moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) himself probably
knew nothing about the lady's diamonds which had been rescued, or
the considerable subscription to St. George's Hospital which had been
extracted from Mr. Melmotte as a make-weight. Poor Marie felt as
though the burden of the hour would be greater than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could bear,
and looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would have fled had flight been possible.
But the trouble passed quickly, and was not really severe. The Prince
said a word or two between each figure, and did not seem to expect a
reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) made a few words go a long way, and was well trained in the
work of easing the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own greatness for those who were for
the moment inflicted with it. When the dance was over he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was allowed
to escape after the ceremony of a single glass of champagne drank in
the presence of the hostess. Considerable skill was shown in keeping
the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) royal guest a secret from the host himself
till the Prince was gone. Melmotte would have desired to pour out
that glass of wine with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own hands, to solace his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) tongue by
Royal Highnesses, and would probably have been troublesome and
disagreeable. Miles Grendall had understood all this and had managed
the affair very well. <div class="bookquote">``Bless my soul;--his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Royal Highness come and
gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``You and my father were so fast at your
whist that it was impossible to get you away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles. Melmotte
was not a fool, and understood it all;--understood not only that it
had been thought better that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should not speak to the Prince, but
also that it might be better that it should be so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could not have
everything at once. Miles Grendall was very useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
would not quarrel with Miles, at any rate as yet.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: The Duchess followed with the male victim.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have another rubber, Alfred?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) said to Miles's father as the
carriages were taking away the guests.

<p/>Lord Alfred had taken sundry glasses of champagne, and for a moment
forgot the bills in the safe, and the good things which his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) boys were
receiving. <div class="bookquote">``Damn that kind of nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Call people by
their proper names.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) left the house without a further word
to the master of it. That night before they went to sleep Melmotte
required from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) weary wife an account of the ball, and especially
of Marie's conduct. <div class="bookquote">``Marie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Madame Melmotte said, ``had behaved well,
but had certainly preferred ``Sir Carbury' to any other of the young
men.'' Hitherto Mr. Melmotte had heard very little of ``Sir Carbury,''
except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a baronet. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eyes and ears were always
open, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) attended to everything, and was a man of sharp
intelligence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not yet quite understand the bearing and
sequence of English titles. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must get for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter
either an eldest son, or one absolutely in possession himself.
Sir Felix, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learned, was only a baronet; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
in possession. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had discovered also that Sir Felix's son would
in course of time also become Sir Felix. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not therefore at
the present moment disposed to give any positive orders as to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter's conduct to the young baronet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not, however,
conceive that the young baronet had as yet addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) girl in such
words as Felix had in truth used when they parted. ``You know who it
is,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``likes you better than any one else in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody does;--don't, Sir Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) hand for a minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
face and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) thought it very sweet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had studied the words as a
lesson, and, repeating them as a lesson, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it fairly well. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
did it well enough at any rate to send the poor girl to bed with a
sweet conviction that at last a man had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could
love.




<p/>CHAPTER V.

<p/>AFTER THE BALL.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's weary work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got into the brougham with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother and sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What must it have been to me then, who had nothing to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the having something to do that makes me call it weary work.
By-the-bye, now I think of it, I'll run down to the club before I go
home.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So saying he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head out of the brougham, and stopped the
driver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is two o'clock, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it is, but you see I'm hungry. You had supper, perhaps;
I had none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going down to the club for supper at this time in the
morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go to bed hungry if I don't. Good night.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped
out of the brougham, called a cab, and had himself driven to the
Beargarden. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared to himself that the men there would think it
mean of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not give them their revenge. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
play on the preceding night, and had again won. Dolly Longestaffe
owed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now a considerable sum of money, and Lord Grasslough was
also in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) debt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was sure that Grasslough would go to the club
after the ball, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was determined that they should not think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had submitted to be carried home by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) mother and sister. So
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) argued with himself; but in truth the devil of gambling was hot
within his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) bosom; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) feared that in losing he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) might lose
real money, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) won it would be long before he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was paid,
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could not keep himself from the card-table.

<p/>Neither mother or daughter said a word till they reached home and had
got up-stairs. Then the elder spoke of the trouble that was nearest
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart at the moment. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) gambles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) has got no money, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear that might not hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) has money with him (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), though,
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) and such friends as he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) has, it is not much. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) gambles
everything is lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose they all do play,--more or less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) played. I am wearied too, out of all heart,
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) want of consideration to me. It is not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) will not obey
me. A mother perhaps should not expect obedience from a grown-up son.
But my word is nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has no respect for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would as
soon do what is wrong before me as before the merest stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) has been so long his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own master, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own master! And yet I must provide for him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
were but a child. Hetta, you spent the whole evening talking to Paul
Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mamma;--that is unjust.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was always with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew nobody else. I could not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) not to speak to me. I
danced with him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) twice.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother was seated, with both her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands up
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forehead, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``If you did not want me to speak
to Paul you should not have taken me there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to prevent your speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). You know what I
want.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div>Henrietta came up and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) good night.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I am the unhappiest woman in all London,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) said, sobbing
hysterically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it my fault, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could save me from much if you would. I work like a horse,
and I never spend a shilling that I can help. I want nothing for
myself,--nothing for myself. Nobody has suffered as I have. But Felix
never thinks of me for a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think of you, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you did you would accept your cousin's offer. What right have you
to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)? I believe it is all because of that young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mamma; it is not because of that young man. I like my cousin
very much;--but that is all. Good night, mamma.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury just
allowed herself to be kissed, and then was left alone.

<p/>At eight o'clock the next morning daybreak found four young men who
had just risen from a card-table at the Beargarden. The Beargarden
was so pleasant a club that there was no rule whatsoever as to its
being closed,--the only law being that it should not be opened before
three in the afternoon. A sort of sanction had, however, been given
to the servants to demur to producing supper or drinks after six in
the morning, so that, about eight, unrelieved tobacco began to be too
heavy even for juvenile constitutions. The party consisted of Dolly
Longestaffe, Lord Grasslough, Miles Grendall, and Felix Carbury, and
the four had amused themselves during the last six hours with various
innocent games. They had commenced with whist, and had culminated
during the last half-hour with blind hookey. But during the whole
night Felix had won. Miles Grendall hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>), and there had been an
expressed opinion between Miles and the young lord that it would be
both profitable and proper to relieve Sir Felix of the winnings of
the last two nights. The two men had played with the same object, and
being young had shown their intention,--so that a certain feeling of
hostility had been engendered. The reader is not to understand that
either of them had cheated, or that the baronet had entertained
any suspicion of foul play. But Felix had felt that Grendall and
Grasslough were his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) enemies, and had thrown himself on Dolly for
sympathy and friendship. Dolly, however, was very tipsy.

<p/>At eight o'clock in the morning there came a sort of settling, though
no money then passed. The ready-money transactions had not lasted
long through the night. Grasslough was the chief loser, and the
figures and scraps of paper which had been passed over to Carbury,
when counted up, amounted to nearly #2,000. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) lordship contested
the fact bitterly, but contested it in vain. There were his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) own
initials and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) own figures, and even Miles Grendall, who was
supposed to be quite wide awake, could not reduce the amount. Then
Grendall had lost over #400 to Carbury,--an amount, indeed, that
mattered little, as Miles could, at present, as easily have raised
#40,000. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) I.O.U. to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) opponent with an easy
air. Grasslough, also, was impecunious; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had a father,--also
impecunious, indeed; but with them the matter would not be hopeless.
Dolly Longestaffe was so tipsy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) could not even assist in
making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) own account. That was to be left between him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) and
Carbury for some future occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you'll be here to-morrow,--that is to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,--only one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>answered Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What one thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think these things should be squared before we play any more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Grasslough angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to
hint anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never hint anything, my Grassy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``I believe when
people play cards, it's intended to be ready-money, that's all. But
I'm not going to stand on P's and Q's with you. I'll give you your
revenge to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was speaking to Lord Grasslough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) is an old
friend, and we know each other. You have been rather rough to-night,
Mr. Grendall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rough;--what the devil do you mean by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think it will be as well that our account should be settled
before we begin again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A settlement once a week is the kind of thing I'm used to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said
Grendall.

<p/>There was nothing more said; but the young men did not part on good
terms. Felix, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) got himself taken home, calculated that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
could realize his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) spoil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) might begin the campaign again with
horses, servants, and all luxuries as before. If all were paid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
would have over #3,000!




<p/>CHAPTER VI.

<p/>ROGER CARBURY AND PAUL MONTAGUE.


<p/>Roger Carbury, of Carbury Hall, the owner of a small property in
Suffolk, was the head of the Carbury family. The Carburys had been in
Suffolk a great many years,--certainly from the time of the War of
the Roses,--and had always held up their heads. But they had never
held them very high. It was not known that any had risen ever to
the honour of knighthood before Sir Patrick, going higher than that,
had been made a baronet. They had, however, been true to their
acres and their acres true to them through the perils of civil wars,
Reformation, Commonwealth, and Revolution, and the head Carbury of
the day had always owned, and had always lived at, Carbury Hall. At
the beginning of the present century the squire of Carbury had been
a considerable man, if not in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) county, at any rate in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part of
the county. The income of the estate had sufficed to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
live plenteously and hospitably, to drink port wine, to ride a stout
hunter, and to keep an old lumbering coach for his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) wife's use when
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went avisiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had an old butler who had never lived anywhere
else, and a boy from the village who was in a way apprenticed to the
butler. There was a cook, not too proud to wash up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own dishes,
and a couple of young women;--while the house was kept by Mrs.
Carbury herself, who marked and gave out her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own linen, made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
preserves, and looked to the curing of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own hams. In the year 1800
the Carbury property was sufficient for the Carbury house. Since that
time the Carbury property has considerably increased in value, and
the rents have been raised. Even the acreage has been extended by
the enclosure of commons. But the income is no longer comfortably
adequate to the wants of an English gentleman's household. If a
moderate estate in land be left to a man now, there arises the
question whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not damaged unless an income also be left to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wherewith to keep up the estate. Land is a luxury, and of all
luxuries is the most costly. Now the Carburys never had anything but
land. Suffolk has not been made rich and great either by coal or
iron. No great town had sprung up on the confines of the Carbury
property. No eldest son had gone into trade or risen high in a
profession so as to add to the Carbury wealth. No great heiress had
been married. There had been no ruin,--no misfortune. But in the days
of which we write the Squire of Carbury Hall had become a poor man
simply through the wealth of others. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) estate was supposed to bring
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in #2,000 a year. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been content to let the Manor House, to
live abroad, and to have an agent at home to deal with the tenants,
he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) would undoubtedly have had enough to live luxuriously. But he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>)
lived on his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) own land among his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) own people, as all the Carburys
before him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had done, and was poor because he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) was surrounded by rich
neighbours. The Longestaffes of Caversham,--of which family Dolly
Longestaffe was the eldest son and hope,--had the name of great
wealth, but the founder of the family had been a Lord Mayor of
London and a chandler as lately as in the reign of Queen Anne. The
Hepworths, who could boast good blood enough on their own side, had
married into new money. The Primeros,--though the good nature of the
country folk had accorded to the head of them the title of Squire
Primero,--had been trading Spaniards fifty years ago, and had bought
the Bundlesham property from a great duke. The estates of those three
gentlemen, with the domain of the Bishop of Elmham, lay all around
the Carbury property, and in regard to wealth enabled their owners
altogether to overshadow our squire. The superior wealth of a bishop
was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) desired that bishops should be rich, and was
among those who thought that the country had been injured when the
territorial possessions of our prelates had been converted into
stipends by Act of Parliament. But the grandeur of the Longestaffes
and the too apparent wealth of the Primeros did oppress him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), though
he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was a man who would never breathe a word of such oppression into
the ear even of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) dearest friend. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) opinion,--which he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
did not care to declare loudly, but which was fully understood to be
his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) opinion by those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) lived intimately,--that a man's
standing in the world should not depend at all upon his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) wealth. The
Primeros were undoubtedly beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) in the social scale, although
the young Primeros had three horses apiece, and killed legions of
pheasants annually at about 10_s_. a head. Hepworth of Eardly was a
very good fellow, who gave himself no airs and understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Hepworth</b></font>) duties
as a country gentleman; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hepworth</b></font>) could not be more than on a par with
Carbury of Carbury, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hepworth</b></font>) was supposed to enjoy #7,000 a year.
The Longestaffes were altogether oppressive. Their footmen, even in
the country, had powdered hair. They had a house in town,--a house
of their own,--and lived altogether as magnates. The lady was Lady
Pomona Longestaffe. The daughters, who certainly were handsome, had
been destined to marry peers. The only son, Dolly, had, or had had,
a fortune of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own. They were an oppressive people in a country
neighbourhood. And to make the matter worse, rich as they were,
they never were able to pay anybody anything that they owed. They
continued to live with all the appurtenances of wealth. The girls
always had horses to ride, both in town and country. The acquaintance
of Dolly the reader has already made. Dolly, who certainly was a poor
creature though good natured, had energy in one direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would
quarrel perseveringly with his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) father, who only had a life interest
in the estate. The house at Caversham Park was during six or seven
months, of the year full of servants, if not of guests, and all
the tradesmen in the little towns around, Bungay, Beccles, and
Harlestone, were aware that the Longestaffes were the great people
of that country. Though occasionally much distressed for money,
they would always execute the Longestaffe orders with submissive
punctuality, because there was an idea that the Longestaffe property
was sound at the bottom. And, then, the owner of a property so
managed cannot scrutinise bills very closely.

<p/>Carbury of Carbury had never owed a shilling that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) could not pay,
or his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) father before him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) orders to the tradesmen at Beccles were
not extensive, and care was used to see that the goods supplied were
neither overcharged nor unnecessary. The tradesmen, consequently, of
Beccles did not care much for Carbury of Carbury;--though perhaps one
or two of the elders among them entertained some ancient reverence
for the family. Roger Carbury, Esq., was Carbury of Carbury,--a
distinction of itself, which, from its nature, could not belong to
the Longestaffes and Primeros, which did not even belong to the
Hepworths of Eardly. The very parish in which Carbury Hall stood,--or
Carbury Manor House, as it was more properly called,--was Carbury
parish. And there was Carbury Chase, partly in Carbury parish and
partly in Bundlesham,--but belonging, unfortunately, in its entirety
to the Bundlesham estate.

<p/>Roger Carbury himself was all alone in the world. His (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) nearest
relatives of the name were Sir Felix and Henrietta, but they were no
more than second cousins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had sisters, but they had long since
been married and had gone away into the world with their husbands,
one to India, and another to the far west of the United States. At
present he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was not much short of forty years of age, and was still
unmarried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was a stout, good-looking man, with a firmly set square
face, with features finely cut, a small mouth, good teeth, and
well-formed chin. His (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hair was red, curling round his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) head, which
was now partly bald at the top. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wore no other beard than small,
almost unnoticeable whiskers. His (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes were small, but bright, and
very cheery when his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) humour was good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was about five feet nine in
height, having the appearance of great strength and perfect health.
A more manly man to the eye was never seen. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was one with
whom you would instinctively wish at first sight to be on good
terms,--partly because in looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) there would come on you an
unconscious conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be very stout in holding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opponents; partly also from a conviction equally strong,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be very pleasant to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends.

<p/>When Sir Patrick had come home from India as an invalid, Roger
Carbury had hurried up to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in London, and had proffered him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
all kindness. Would Sir Patrick and his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) wife and children like to
go down to the old place in the country? Sir Patrick did not care
a straw for the old place in the country, and so told his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) cousin
in almost those very words. There had not, therefore, been much
friendship during Sir Patrick's life. But when the violent
ill-conditioned old man was dead, Roger paid a second visit, and
again offered hospitality to the widow and her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) daughter,--and to the
young baronet. The young baronet had just joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) regiment and
did not care to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin in Suffolk; but Lady Carbury and
Henrietta had spent a month there, and everything had been done to
make them happy. The effort as regarded Henrietta had been altogether
successful. As regarded the widow, it must be acknowledged that
Carbury Hall had not quite suited her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) tastes. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had already begun
to sigh for the glories of a literary career. A career of some
kind,--sufficient to repay her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) for the sufferings of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) early
life,--she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) certainly desired. <div class="bookquote">``Dear cousin Roger,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>),
had not seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) to have much power of assisting her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) in these
views. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was a woman who did not care much for country charms.
She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had endeavoured to get up some mild excitement with the
bishop, but the bishop had been too plain spoken and sincere for
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). The Primeros had been odious; the Hepworths stupid; the
Longestaffes,--she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had endeavoured to make up a little friendship
with Lady Pomona,--insufferably supercilious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) had declared to
Henrietta <div class="bookquote">``that Carbury Hall was very dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div><p/>But then there had come a circumstance which altogether changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
opinions as to Carbury Hall, and its proprietor. The proprietor
after a few weeks followed them up to London, and made a most
matter-of-fact offer to the mother for the daughter's hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) was at
that time thirty-six, and Henrietta was not yet twenty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) was very
cool;--some might have thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) phlegmatic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) love-making.
Henrietta declared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had not in the least
expected it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) was very urgent, and very persistent. Lady
Carbury was eager on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) side. Though the Carbury Manor House did not
exactly suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), it would do admirably for Henrietta. And as for
age, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) thinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) being then over forty, a man of thirty-six
was young enough for any girl. But Henrietta had an opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin, but did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was amazed, and
even annoyed by the offer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had praised him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) and praised the house
so loudly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother,--having in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) innocence never dreamed of
such a proposition as this,--so that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) found it difficult to
give an adequate reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) refusal. Yes;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had undoubtedly
said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin was charming, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had not meant charming in
that way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) did refuse the offer very plainly, but still with some
apparent lack of persistency. When Roger suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) should
take a few months to think of it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother supported Roger's
suggestion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could say nothing stronger than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was afraid
that thinking about it would not do any good. Their first visit to
Carbury had been made in September. In the following February she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
went there again,--much against the grain as far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own wishes
were concerned; and when there had been cold, constrained, almost
dumb in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin. Before they left the offer was
renewed, but Henrietta declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could not do as they would
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could give no reason, only she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin
in that way. But Roger declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) by no means intended to
abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) suit. In truth he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) verily loved the girl, and love with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was a serious thing. All this happened a full year before the
beginning of our present story.

<p/>But something else happened also. While that second visit was being
made at Carbury there came to the hall a young man of whom Roger
Carbury had said much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousins,--one Paul Montague, of whom
some short account shall be given in this chapter. The squire,--Roger
Carbury was always called the squire about his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own place,--had
anticipated no evil when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) so timed this second visit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousins
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) house that they must of necessity meet Paul Montague there.
But great harm had come of it. Paul Montague had fallen into love
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin's guest, and there had sprung up much unhappiness.

<p/>Lady Carbury and Henrietta had been nearly a month at Carbury, and
Paul Montague had been there barely a week, when Roger Carbury thus
spoke to the guest who had last arrived. <div class="bookquote">``I've got to tell you
something, Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything serious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very serious to me. I may say so serious that nothing in my own
life can approach it in importance.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had unconsciously assumed
that look, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend so thoroughly understood, indicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
resolve to hold to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) believed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own, and to fight if
fighting be necessary. Montague knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) well, and became half aware
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had done something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew not what, militating against this
serious resolve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) looked up, but said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``I
have offered my hand in marriage to my cousin Henrietta,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger
very gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; to Henrietta Carbury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) has not accepted it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) has refused
me twice. But I still have hopes of success. Perhaps I have no right
to hope, but I do. I tell it you just as it is. Everything in life to
me depends upon it. I think I may count upon your sympathy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you not tell me before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul Montague in a hoarse
voice.

<p/>Then there had come a sudden and rapid interchange of quick speaking
between the men, each of them speaking the truth exactly, each of
them declaring himself to be in the right and to be ill-used by
the other, each of them equally hot, equally generous, and equally
unreasonable. Montague at once asserted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) also loved Henrietta
Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) blurted out his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) assurance in the baldest and most
incomplete manner, but still in such words as to leave no doubt.
No;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not said a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had intended to consult Roger
Carbury himself,--should have done so in a day or two,--perhaps on
that very day had not Roger spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You have neither of you
a shilling in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger; <div class="bookquote">``and now you know what my
feelings are you must abandon it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Then Montague declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
had a right to speak to Miss Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not suppose that Miss
Carbury cared a straw about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not the least reason to think
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did. It was altogether impossible. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had a right to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
chance. That chance was all the world to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). As to money,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would
not admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was a pauper, and, moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might earn an
income as well as other men. Had Carbury told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that the young
lady had shown the slightest intention to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), Carbury's,
addresses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), Paul, would at once have disappeared from the scene.
But as it was not so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
hope.

<p/>The scene lasted for above an hour. When it was ended, Paul Montague
packed up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) clothes and was driven away to the railway station
by Roger himself, without seeing either of the ladies. There had been
very hot words between the men, but the last words which Roger spoke
to the other on the railway platform were not quarrelsome in their
nature. <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said, pressing Paul's hands.
Paul's eyes were full of tears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) replied only by returning the
pressure.

<p/>Paul Montague's father and mother had long been dead. The father had
been a barrister in London, having perhaps some small fortune of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
own. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had, at any rate, left to this son, who was one among others,
a sufficiency with which to begin the world. Paul when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had come
of age had found himself possessed of about #6,000. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was then at
Oxford, and was intended for the bar. An uncle of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), a younger
brother of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) father, had married a Carbury, the younger sister
of two, though older than her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother Roger. This uncle many years
since had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife out to California, and had there become an
American. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had a large tract of land, growing wool, and wheat, and
fruit; but whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) prospered or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not, had not always
been plain to the Montagues and Carburys at home. The intercourse
between the two families had in the quite early days of Paul
Montague's life, created an affection between him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and Roger, who, as
will be understood by those who have carefully followed the above
family history, were not in any degree related to each other. Roger,
when quite a young man, had had the charge of the boy's education,
and had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to Oxford. But the Oxford scheme, to be followed by
the bar, and to end on some one of the many judicial benches of the
country, had not succeeded. Paul had got into a <div class="bookquote">``row''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>at Balliol, and
had been rusticated,--had then got into another row, and was sent
down. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had a talent for rows,--though, as Roger Carbury
always declared, there was nothing really wrong about any of them.
Paul was then twenty-one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) took himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) money out to
California, and joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) uncle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had perhaps an idea,--based on
very insufficient grounds,--that rows are popular in California. At
the end of three years he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not like farming life in
California,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not like his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) uncle. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
returned to England, but on returning was altogether unable to get
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) #6,000 out of the Californian farm. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been compelled
to come away without any of it, with funds insufficient even to take
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) home, accepting with much dissatisfaction an assurance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
uncle that an income amounting to ten per cent. upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) capital
should be remitted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) with the regularity of clockwork. The
clock alluded to must have been one of Sam Slick's. It had gone
very badly. At the end of the first quarter there came the proper
remittance;--then half the amount;--then there was a long interval
without anything; then some dropping payments now and again;--and
then a twelvemonth without anything. At the end of that twelvemonth
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) paid a second visit to California, having borrowed money from
Roger for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) journey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had now again returned, with some little
cash in hand, and with the additional security of a deed executed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) favour by one Hamilton K. Fisker, who had gone into partnership
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) uncle, and who had added a vast flour-mill to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) uncle's
concerns. In accordance with this deed he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was to get twelve per cent.
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) capital, and had enjoyed the gratification of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) name
put up as one of the firm, which now stood as Fisker, Montague, and
Montague. A business declared by the two elder partners to be most
promising had been opened at Fiskerville, about two hundred and fifty
miles from San Francisco, and the hearts of Fisker and the elder
Montague were very high. Paul hated Fisker horribly, did not love his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
uncle much, and would willingly have got back his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) #6,000 had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) been
able. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was not able, and returned as one of Fisker, Montague,
and Montague, not altogether unhappy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had succeeded in
obtaining enough of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) back income to pay what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) owed to Roger, and
to live for a few months. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was intent on considering how he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should
bestow himself, consulting daily with Roger on the subject, when
suddenly Roger had perceived that the young man was becoming attached
to the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) himself loved. What then occurred has been told.

<p/>Not a word was said to Lady Carbury or her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter of the real
cause of Paul's sudden disappearance. It had been necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
should go to London. Each of the ladies probably guessed something
of the truth, but neither spoke a word to the other on the subject.
Before they left the Manor the squire again pleaded his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) cause with
Henrietta, but he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) pleaded it in vain. Henrietta was colder than
ever,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) made use of one unfortunate phrase which destroyed all
the effect which her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) coldness might have had. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was
too young to think of marrying yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had meant to imply that the
difference in their ages was too great, but had not known how to
say it. It was easy to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) that in a twelvemonth she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would be
older;--but it was impossible to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) that any number of
twelvemonths would alter the disparity between her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin.
But even that disparity was not now her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) strongest reason for feeling
sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could not marry Roger Carbury.

<p/>Within a week of the departure of Lady Carbury from the Manor House,
Paul Montague returned, and returned as a still dear friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
promised before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not see Henrietta again for
three months, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would promise nothing further. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) won't
take you, there is no reason why I shouldn't try.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That had been
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) argument. Roger would not accede to the justice even of this.
It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that Paul was bound to retire altogether, partly
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had got no income, partly because of Roger's previous
claim,--partly no doubt in gratitude, but of this last reason Roger
never said a word. If Paul did not see this himself, Paul was not
such a man as his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friend had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to be.

<p/>Paul did see it himself, and had many scruples. But why should his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
friend be a dog in the manger? He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would yield at once to Roger
Carbury's older claims if Roger could make anything of them. Indeed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could have no chance if the girl were disposed to take Roger for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband. Roger had all the advantage of Carbury Manor at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
back, whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) share in the doubtful business
of Fisker, Montague, and Montague, in a wretched little town 250
miles further off than San Francisco! But if, with all this, Roger
could not prevail, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) not try? What Roger said about want
of money was mere nonsense. Paul was sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friend would have
created no such difficulty had not he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) himself been interested. Paul
declared to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had money, though doubtful money, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) certainly would not give up Henrietta on that score.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came up to London at various times in search of certain employment
which had been half promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and, after the expiration of the
three months, constantly saw Lady Carbury and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter. But from
time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had given renewed promises to Roger Carbury that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would not declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) passion,--now for two months, then for
six weeks, then for a month. In the meantime the two men were fast
friends,--so fast that Montague spent by far the greater part of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) time as his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend's guest,--and all this was done with the
understanding that Roger Carbury was to blaze up into hostile wrath
should Paul ever receive the privilege to call himself Henrietta
Carbury's favoured lover, but that everything was to be smooth
between them should Henrietta be persuaded to become the mistress of
Carbury Hall. So things went on up to the night at which Montague
met Henrietta at Madame Melmotte's ball. The reader should also be
informed that there had been already a former love affair in the
young life of Paul Montague. There had been, and indeed there still
was, a widow, one Mrs. Hurtle, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had been desperately anxious
to marry before his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) second journey to California;--but the marriage
had been prevented by the interference of Roger Carbury.




<p/>CHAPTER VII.

<p/>MENTOR.


<p/>Lady Carbury's desire for a union between Roger and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter was
greatly increased by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) solicitude in respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son. Since
Roger's offer had first been made, Felix had gone on from bad to
worse, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) condition had become one of hopeless embarrassment.
If her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) daughter could but be settled in the world, Lady Carbury said
to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could then devote herself to the interests of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had no very clear idea of what that devotion would be. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had paid so much money for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and would have
so much more extracted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), that it might well come to pass that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would be unable to keep a home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter. In all these
troubles she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) constantly appealed to Roger Carbury for advice,--which,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) never followed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
house in town, to find a home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter elsewhere, and also
for Felix if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would consent to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) not so
consent, then let the young man bear the brunt of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own misdoings.
Doubtless, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could no longer get bread in London he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would find
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) out. Roger was always severe when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke of the baronet,--or
seemed to Lady Carbury to be severe.

<p/>But, in truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not ask for advice in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might
follow it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had plans in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) head with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that Roger
would not sympathise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) still thought that Sir Felix might bloom
and burst out into grandeur, wealth, and fashion, as the husband of a
great heiress, and in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) son's vices, was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in
that anticipation. When he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) succeeded in obtaining from her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) money, as
in the case of that #20,--when, with brazen-faced indifference to her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)
remonstrances, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) started off to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) club at two in the morning, when
with impudent drollery he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) almost boasted of the hopelessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
debts, a sickness of heart would come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) would weep
hysterically, and lie the whole night without sleeping. But could he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
marry Miss Melmotte, and thus conquer all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) troubles by means of
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own personal beauty,--then she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be proud of all that had
passed. With such a condition of mind Roger Carbury could have no
sympathy. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) it seemed that a gentleman was disgraced who owed
money to a tradesman which he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) could not pay. And Lady Carbury's heart
was high with other hopes,--in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hysterics and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) fears.
The <div class="bookquote">``Criminal Queens''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>might be a great literary success. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) almost
thought that it would be a success. Messrs. Leadham and Loiter, the
publishers, were civil to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). Mr. Broune had promised. Mr. Booker
had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) would see what could be done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had gathered from
Mr. Alf's caustic and cautious words that the book would be noticed
in the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>No;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would not take dear Roger's advice
as to leaving London. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would continue to ask Roger's advice.
Men like to have their advice asked. And, if possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would
arrange the marriage. What country retirement could be so suitable
for a Lady Carbury when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wished to retire for awhile,--as Carbury
Manor, the seat of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own daughter? And then her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind would fly away
into regions of bliss. If only by the end of this season Henrietta
could be engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin, Felix be the husband of the richest
bride in Europe, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) be the acknowledged author of the cleverest
book of the year, what a Paradise of triumph might still be open to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) troubles! Then the sanguine nature of the woman
would bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) up almost to exultation, and for an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would be
happy, in spite of everything.

<p/>A few days after the ball Roger Carbury was up in town, and was
closeted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) back drawing-room. The declared cause
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) coming was the condition of the baronet's affairs and the
indispensable necessity,--so Roger thought,--of taking some steps by
which at any rate the young man's present expenses might be brought
to an end. It was horrible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that a man who had not a shilling
in the world or any prospect of a shilling, who had nothing and never
thought of earning anything, should have hunters! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very much in
earnest about it, and quite prepared to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to the young
man himself,--if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) now, Lady
Carbury;--at this moment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s out with the Baron.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Being <div class="bookquote">``out with the Baron''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>meant
that the young man was hunting with the stag hounds some forty miles
away from London.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) manage it? Whose horses does he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) ride? Who pays for
them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be angry with me, Roger. What can I do to prevent it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you should refuse to have anything to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
continues in such courses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My own son!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--exactly. But what is to be the end of it? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to be allowed
to ruin you, and Hetta? It can't go on long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't have me throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is throwing you over. And then it is so thoroughly
dishonest,--so ungentlemanlike! I don't understand how it goes on
from day to day. I suppose you don't supply him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) with ready money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has had a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger frowned angrily. <div class="bookquote">``I can understand that you should provide him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
with bed and food, but not that you should pander to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) vices by
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) money.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>This was very plain speaking, and Lady Carbury
winced under it. <div class="bookquote">``The kind of life that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is leading requires a
large income of itself. I understand the thing, and know that with
all I have in the world I could not do it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am older of course,--very much older. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is not so young that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should not begin to comprehend. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) any money beyond what you
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Lady Carbury revealed certain suspicions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had begun to
entertain during the last day or two. <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has been playing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the way to lose money,--not to get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose somebody wins,--sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They who win are the sharpers. They who lose are the dupes. I would
sooner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) were a fool than a knave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Roger, you are so severe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) plays. How would he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pay, were he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to lose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about it. I don't even know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) does play; but
I have reason to think that during the last week he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has had money at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) command. Indeed I have seen it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) comes home at all manner of
hours and sleeps late. Yesterday I went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) room about ten and
did not wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). There were notes and gold lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) table;--ever
so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you not take them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What; rob my own boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you tell me that you are absolutely in want of money to pay
your own bills, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has not hesitated to take yours from you!
Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not repay you what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has borrowed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ah, indeed;--why not? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ought to if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has it. And there were
papers there;--I. O. U.<div class="bookquote">``s, signed by other men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You looked at them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw as much as that. It is not that I am curious, but one does
feel about one's own son. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has bought another horse. A
groom came here and said something about it to the servants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear;--oh dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you could only induce him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) to stop the gambling! Of course it is
very bad whether he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) wins or loses,--though I am sure that Felix would
do nothing unfair. Nobody ever said that of him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) has won money,
it would be a great comfort if he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) would let me have some of it,--for,
to tell the truth, I hardly know how to turn. I am sure nobody can
say that I spend it on myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Roger again repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) advice. There could be no use in
attempting to keep up the present kind of life in Welbeck Street.
Welbeck Street might be very well without a penniless spendthrift
such as Sir Felix, but must be ruinous under the present conditions.
If Lady Carbury felt, as no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did feel, bound to afford a
home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ruined son in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wickedness and folly, that
home should be found far away from London. If he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) chose to remain in
London, let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) do so on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own resources. The young man should make
up his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mind to do something for himself. A career might possibly be
opened for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in India. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) be a man he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) would sooner break stones
than live on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would see his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin to-morrow
and speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>);--that is if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could possibly find him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Young men
who gamble all night, and hunt all day are not easily found.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would come at twelve as Felix generally breakfasted at that hour.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) gave an assurance to Lady Carbury which to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was not the
least comfortable part of the interview. In the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son not
giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) the money which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at once required he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), Roger, would lend
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) a hundred pounds till her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) half year's income should be due. After
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice changed altogether, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) asked a question on another
subject, <div class="bookquote">``Can I see Henrietta to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly;--why not? She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) is at home now, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will wait till to-morrow,--when I call to see Felix. I should like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to know that I am coming. Paul Montague was in town the other
day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was here, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) called.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that all you saw of him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was at the Melmottes' ball. Felix got a card for him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>);--and we
were there. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) gone down to Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--not to Carbury. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had some business about his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) partners
at Liverpool. There is another case of a young man without anything
to do. Not that Paul is at all like Sir Felix.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was induced
to say by the spirit of honesty which was always strong within him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be too hard upon poor Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury. Roger, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) leave, thought that it would be impossible to be too hard
upon Sir Felix Carbury.

<p/>The next morning Lady Carbury was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son's bedroom before he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
up, and with incredible weakness told him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cousin Roger was
coming to lecture him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What the Devil's the use of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix
from beneath the bedclothes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you speak to me in that way, Felix, I must leave the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) coming to me? I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) has got to
say just as if it were said. It's all very well preaching sermons
to good people, but nothing ever was got by preaching to people who
ain't good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't you be good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall do very well, mother, if that fellow will leave me alone. I
can play my hand better than he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) can play it for me. If you'll go now
I'll get up.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had intended to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) for some of the money which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) still possessed, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) courage failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) money, and took it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would in some fashion recognise
and tacitly approve his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) gambling. It was not yet eleven, and it was
early for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) bed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would get
out of the house before that horrible bore should be upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sermon. To do this he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) must be energetic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was actually eating
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) breakfast at half-past eleven, and had already contrived in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind how he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would turn the wrong way as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) got into
the street,--towards Marylebone Road, by which route Roger would
certainly not come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) left the house at ten minutes before twelve,
cunningly turned away, dodging round by the first corner,--and just
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had turned it encountered his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin. Roger, anxious in regard
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) errand, with time at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) command, had come before the hour
appointed and had strolled about, thinking not of Felix but of
Felix's sister. The baronet felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been caught,--caught
unfairly, but by no means abandoned all hope of escape. <div class="bookquote">``I was going
to your mother's house on purpose to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you indeed? I am so sorry. I have an engagement out here with a
fellow which I must keep. I could meet you at any other time, you
know.''

he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) fortified himself with the remembrance of all the money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
pocket,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) winnings,--remembered too certain sweet
words which had passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and Marie Melmotte since the ball,
and resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would not be <div class="bookquote">``sat upon''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by Roger Carbury. The
time was coming,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might almost say that the time had come,--in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might defy Roger Carbury. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) dreaded the words
which were now to be spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) with a craven fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother tells me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, <div class="bookquote">``that you still keep hunters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know any young man who ever did worse, or one who had less

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hadn't half said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had to say, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hardly
knew how to get it said. And of what use could it be to talk to a
young man who was altogether callous and without feeling? The remedy
for the evil ought to be found in the mother's conduct rather than
the son's. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), were she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not foolishly weak, would make up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind
to divide herself utterly from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, at any rate for a while, and
to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to suffer utter penury. That would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) round. And
then when the agony of want had tamed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would be content to
take bread and meat from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand and would be humble. At present he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
had money in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pocket, and would eat and drink of the best, and
be free from inconvenience for the moment. While this prosperity
remained it would be impossible to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You will ruin your
sister, and break your mother's heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, firing a last
harmless shot after the young reprobate.

<p/>When Lady Carbury came into the room, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did as soon as the
front door was closed behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) seemed to think that a
great success had been achieved because the #20 had been recovered.
<div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would give it me back, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not bring it to you of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own accord?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not like to talk about it. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got

he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have it? And you may take it for granted also that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will lose
all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has got. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked in the wildest way,--saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VIII.

<p/>LOVE-SICK.


<p/>Roger Carbury said well that it was very improbable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin, the widow, should agree in their opinions as to the
expedience of fortune-hunting by marriage. It was impossible that
they should ever understand each other. To Lady Carbury the prospect
of a union between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) son and Miss Melmotte was one of unmixed joy
and triumph. Could it have been possible that Marie Melmotte should
be rich and her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father be a man doomed to a deserved sentence in a
penal settlement, there might perhaps be a doubt about it. The wealth
even in that case would certainly carry the day against the disgrace,
and Lady Carbury would find reasons why <div class="bookquote">``poor Marie''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>should not be
punished for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) father's sins, even while enjoying the money which
those sins had produced. But how different were the existing facts?
Mr. Melmotte was not at the galleys, but was entertaining duchesses
in Grosvenor Square. People said that Mr. Melmotte had a reputation
throughout Europe as a gigantic swindler,--as one who in the
dishonest and successful pursuit of wealth had stopped at nothing.
People said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had framed and carried out long
premeditated and deeply laid schemes for the ruin of those who
had trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had swallowed up the property of all who
had come in contact with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was fed with the blood of
widows and children;--but what was all this to Lady Carbury? If the
duchesses condoned it all, did it become her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to be prudish? People
also said that Melmotte would yet get a fall,--that a man who had
risen after such a fashion never could long keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head up. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
might keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head up long enough to give Marie her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) fortune. And
then Felix wanted a fortune so badly;--was so exactly the young man
who ought to marry a fortune! To Lady Carbury there was no second way
of looking at the matter.

<p/>And to Roger Carbury also there was no second way of looking at it.
That condonation of antecedents which, in the hurry of the world,
is often vouchsafed to success, that growing feeling which induces
people to assert to themselves that they are not bound to go outside
the general verdict, and that they may shake hands with whomsoever
the world shakes hands with, had never reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). The old-fashioned
idea that the touching of pitch will defile still prevailed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was a gentleman;--and would have felt himself disgraced to enter
the house of such a one as Augustus Melmotte. Not all the duchesses
in the peerage, or all the money in the city, could alter his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) notions
or induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to modify his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) conduct. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew that it would be
useless for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to explain this to Lady Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) trusted, however,
that one of the family might be taught to appreciate the difference
between honour and dishonour. Henrietta Carbury had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought, a
higher turn of mind than her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother, and had as yet been kept free
from soil. As for Felix,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had so grovelled in the gutters as to be
dirt all over. Nothing short of the prolonged sufferings of half a
life could cleanse him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found Henrietta alone in the drawing-room. <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Felix?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) said, as soon as they had greeted each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in the street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are so unhappy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say but that you have reason. I think, you know, that your
mother indulges him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) foolishly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor mamma! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) worships the very ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) treads on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even a mother should not throw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) worship away like that. The fact
is that your brother will ruin you both if this goes on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can mamma do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave London, and then refuse to pay a shilling on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) behalf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would Felix do in the country?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did nothing, how much better would that be than what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does
in town? You would not like him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to become a professional gambler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Carbury; you do not mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) does that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems cruel to say such things to you,--but in a matter of such
importance one is bound to speak the truth. I have no influence over
your mother; but you may have some. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asks my advice, but has not
the slightest idea of listening to it. I don't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for that;
but I am anxious for the sake of--, for the sake of the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially for your sake. You will never throw him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not ask me to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may drag you into the mud. For his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sake you have already been
taken into the house of that man Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think that I shall be injured by anything of that kind,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div>said Henrietta, drawing herself up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me if I seem to interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no;--it is no interference from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me then if I am rough. To me it seems that an injury is done
to you if you are made to go to the house of such a one as this man.
Why does your mother seek his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) society? Not because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) likes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);
not because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has any sympathy with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family;--but simply
because there is a rich daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody goes there, Mr. Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--that is the excuse which everybody makes. Is that sufficient
reason for you to go to a man's house? Is there not another place to
which we are told that a great many are going, simply because the
road has become thronged and fashionable? Have you no feeling that
you ought to choose your friends for certain reasons of your own?
I admit there is one reason here. They have a great deal of money,
and it is thought possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may get some of it by falsely
swearing to a girl that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). After what you have heard, are
the Melmottes people with whom you would wish to be connected?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. I know very well. They are absolutely disgraceful. A
social connection with the first crossing-sweeper would be less
objectionable.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) spoke with a degree of energy of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
himself altogether unaware. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knit his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brows, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eyes flashed,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) nostrils were extended. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
offer to herself. Of course her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mind at once conceived,--not that the
Melmotte connection could ever really affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) felt sure
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would never accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) offer,--but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be so affected. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) resented the feeling which she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
thus attributed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). But, in truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was much too simple-minded
for any such complex idea. <div class="bookquote">``Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``has already
descended so far that I cannot pretend to be anxious as to what
houses he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may frequent. But I should be sorry to think that you
should often be seen at Mr. Melmotte's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Mr. Carbury, that mamma will take care that I am not taken
where I ought not to be taken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you to have some opinion of your own as to what is proper for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I have. I am sorry you should think that I have not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am old-fashioned, Hetta.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And we belong to a newer and worse sort of world. I dare say it is
so. You have been always very kind, but I almost doubt whether you
can change us now. I have sometimes thought that you and mamma were
hardly fit for each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought that you and I were,--or possibly might be fit for
each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,--as for me, I shall always take mamma's side. If mamma chooses
to go to the Melmottes I shall certainly go with her (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>). If that is
contamination, I suppose I must be contaminated. I don't see why I'm
to consider myself better than any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have always thought that you were better than any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was before I went to the Melmottes. I am sure you have altered
your opinion now. Indeed, you have told me so. I am afraid, Mr.
Carbury, you must go your way, and we must go ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) spoke, and gradually began to perceive
the working of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was so true himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not
understand that there should be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) even that violet-coloured
tinge of prevarication which women assume as an additional charm.
Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) really have thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was attending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
possible future interests when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) as to the making of new
acquaintances?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand and making a slight vain

that is, to travel the same road with you. I do not say that you
ought to wish it too; but you ought to know that I am sincere. When
I spoke of the Melmottes, did you believe that I was thinking of
myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no;--how should I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was speaking to you then as to a cousin who might regard me as an
elder brother. No contact with legions of Melmottes could make you
other to me than the woman on whom my heart has settled. Even were
you in truth disgraced,--could disgrace touch one so pure as you,--it
would be the same. I love you so well that I have already taken you
for better or for worse. I cannot change. My nature is too stubborn
for such changes. Have you a word to say to comfort me?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) turned
away her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) head, but did not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at once. <div class="bookquote">``Do you understand how

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. I shall live, no doubt; but I shall not do very well.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you mean something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean a great deal, dear. I mean all that a man can mean. That is
it. You hardly understand that I am serious to the extent of ecstatic
joy on the one side, and utter indifference to the world on the
other. I shall never give it up till I learn that you are to be
married to some one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I say, Mr. Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you will love me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I don't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say that you will try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I will not say that. Love should come without a struggle. I
don't know how one person is to try to love another in that way. I
like you very much; but being married is such a terrible thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not be terrible to me, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--when you found that I was too young for your tastes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall persevere, you know. Will you assure me of this,--that if
you promise your hand to another man, you will let me know at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I may promise that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) said, after pausing for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no one as yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no one. But, Mr. Carbury, you have no right to question me.
I don't think it generous. I allow you to say things that nobody else
could say because you are a cousin and because mamma trusts you so
much. No one but mamma has a right to ask me whether I care for any
one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you angry with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I have offended you it is because I love you so dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not offended, but I don't like to be questioned by a gentleman.
I don't think any girl would like it. I am not to tell everybody all
that happens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps when you reflect how much of my happiness depends upon it
you will forgive me. Good-bye now.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and
allowed it to remain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``When I walk about the old
shrubberies at Carbury where we used to be together, I am always
asking myself what chance there is of your walking there as the
mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am, of course, prepared to hear you say so. Well; good-bye, and
may God bless you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man had no poetry about him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not even care for romance.
All the outside belongings of love which are so pleasant to many men
and which to many women afford the one sweetness in life which they
really relish, were nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). There are both men and women to
whom even the delays and disappointments of love are charming, even
when they exist to the detriment of hope. It is sweet to such persons
to be melancholy, sweet to pine, sweet to feel that they are now
wretched after a romantic fashion as have been those heroes and
heroines of whose sufferings they have read in poetry. But there was
nothing of this with Roger Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) believed, found
the woman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) really wanted, who was worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) love, and now,
having fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heart upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) longed for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with an amazing
longing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had spoken the simple truth when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) declared that life
had become indifferent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). No man in England could
be less likely to throw himself off the Monument or to blow out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
brains. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt numbed in all the joints of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind by this
sorrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not make one thing bear upon another, so as to
console himself after any fashion. There was but one thing for
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);--to persevere till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had finally lost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
And should the latter be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fate, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to fear that it would
be, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would live, but live only, like a crippled man.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt almost sure in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart of hearts that the girl loved that
other, younger man. That she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never owned to such love he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
quite sure. The man himself and Henrietta also had both assured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
on this point, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man easily satisfied by words and prone
to believe. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that Paul Montague was attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),
and that it was Paul's intention to cling to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love. Sorrowfully
looking forward through the vista of future years, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw
that Henrietta would become Paul's wife. Were it so, what should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
do? Annihilate himself as far as all personal happiness in the world
was concerned, and look solely to their happiness, their prosperity,
and their joys? Be as it were a beneficent old fairy to them, though
the agony of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own disappointment should never depart from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do this, and be blessed by them,--or should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let Paul
Montague know what deep resentment such ingratitude could produce?
When had a father been kinder to a son, or a brother to a brother,
than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been to Paul? His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) home had been the young man's home, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) purse the young man's purse. What right could the young man have
to come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was perfecting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bliss and rob him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of
all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in the world? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was conscious all the while that
there was a something wrong in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) argument,--that Paul when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
commenced to love the girl knew nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend's love,--that
the girl, though Paul had never come in the way, might probably have
been as obdurate as she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was now to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entreaties. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew all this
because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was clear. But yet the injustice,--at any rate, the
misery was so great, that to forgive it and to reward it would be
weak, womanly, and foolish. Roger Carbury did not quite believe in
the forgiveness of injuries. If you pardon all the evil done to you,
you encourage others to do you evil! If you give your cloak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
who steals your coat, how long will it be before your shirt and
trousers will go also? Roger Carbury returned that afternoon to
Suffolk, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought of it all throughout the journey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would never forgive Paul Montague if Paul Montague
should become his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin's husband.




<p/>CHAPTER IX.

<p/>THE GREAT RAILWAY TO VERA CRUZ.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been a guest in his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) house. Then, I guess, the thing's about
as good as done.''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>These words were spoken with a fine, sharp, nasal
twang by a brilliantly-dressed American gentleman in one of the
smartest private rooms of the great railway hotel at Liverpool, and
they were addressed to a young Englishman who was sitting opposite
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>). Between them there was a table covered with maps, schedules,
and printed programmes. The American was smoking a very large cigar,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) kept constantly turning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) mouth, and half of which
was inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) teeth. The Englishman had a short pipe. Mr. Hamilton
K. Fisker, of the firm of Fisker, Montague, and Montague, was the
American, and the Englishman was our friend Paul, the junior member
of that firm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I didn't even speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In commercial affairs that matters nothing. It quite justifies you
in introducing me. We are not going to ask your friend to do us a
favour. We don't want to borrow money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll go in for the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'d be one of us, and there would
be no borrowing then. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll join us if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s as clever as they say,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll see his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) way to making a couple of million of dollars
out of it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'d take the trouble to run over and show himself in
San Francisco, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)'d make double that. The moneyed men would go in
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) at once, because they know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) understands the game and
has got the pluck. A man who has done what he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) has by financing in
Europe,--by George! there's no limit to what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might do with us.
We're a bigger people than any of you and have more room. We go after
bigger things, and don't stand shilly-shally on the brink as you do.
But Melmotte pretty nigh beats the best among us. Anyway he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should
come and try his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) luck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) couldn't have a bigger thing or a safer
thing than this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'d see it immediately if I could talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) for
half an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fisker,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul mysteriously, <div class="bookquote">``as we are partners, I think
I ought to let you know that many people speak very badly of Mr.
Melmotte's honesty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Fisker smiled gently, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) cigar twice round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) mouth,
and then closed one eye. <div class="bookquote">``There is always a want of charity,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``when a man is successful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The scheme in question was the grand proposal for a South Central
Pacific and Mexican railway, which was to run from the Salt Lake
City, thus branching off from the San Francisco and Chicago
line,--and pass down through the fertile lands of New Mexico and
Arizona, into the territory of the Mexican Republic, run by the city
of Mexico, and come out on the gulf at the port of Vera Cruz. Mr.
Fisker admitted at once that it was a great undertaking, acknowledged
that the distance might be perhaps something over 2,000 miles,
acknowledged that no computation had or perhaps could be made as to
the probable cost of the railway; but seemed to think that questions
such as these were beside the mark and childish. Melmotte, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would go into the matter at all, would ask no such questions.

<p/>But we must go back a little. Paul Montague had received a telegram
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) partner, Hamilton K. Fisker, sent on shore at Queenstown
from one of the New York liners, requesting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) to meet Fisker at
Liverpool immediately. With this request he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had felt himself bound to
comply. Personally he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had disliked Fisker,--and perhaps not the less
so because when in California he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had never found himself able to
resist the man's good humour, audacity, and cleverness combined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
had found himself talked into agreeing with any project which Mr.
Fisker might have in hand. It was altogether against the grain with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>), and yet by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) own consent, that the flour-mill had been opened
at Fiskerville. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) trembled for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) money and never wished to see
Fisker again; but still, when Fisker came to England, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was proud
to remember that Fisker was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) partner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) obeyed the order and
went down to Liverpool.

<p/>If the flour-mill had frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>), what must the present project
have done! Fisker explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had come with two objects,--first
to ask the consent of the English partner to the proposed change in
their business, and secondly to obtain the co-operation of English
capitalists. The proposed change in the business meant simply the
entire sale of the establishment at Fiskerville, and the absorption
of the whole capital in the work of getting up the railway. <div class="bookquote">``If you
could realise all the money it wouldn't make a mile of the railway,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul. Mr. Fisker laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). The object of Fisker, Montague,
and Montague was not to make a railway to Vera Cruz, but to float
a company. Paul thought that Mr. Fisker seemed to be indifferent
whether the railway should ever be constructed or not. It was clearly
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) idea that fortunes were to be made out of the concern before a
spadeful of earth had been moved. If brilliantly printed programmes
might avail anything, with gorgeous maps, and beautiful little
pictures of trains running into tunnels beneath snowy mountains and
coming out of them on the margin of sunlit lakes, Mr. Fisker had
certainly done much. But Paul, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) saw all these pretty things,
could not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) mind from thinking whence had come the money to
pay for them. Mr. Fisker had declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had come over to obtain
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) partner's consent, but it seemed to that partner that a great
deal had been done without any consent. And Paul's fears on this hand
were not allayed by finding that on all these beautiful papers he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
himself was described as one of the agents and general managers of
the company. Each document was signed Fisker, Montague, and Montague.
References on all matters were to be made to Fisker, Montague, and
Montague,--and in one of the documents it was stated that a member
of the firm had proceeded to London with the view of attending to
British interests in the matter. Fisker had seemed to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
young partner would express unbounded satisfaction at the greatness
which was thus falling upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). A certain feeling of importance,
not altogether unpleasant, was produced, but at the same time there
was another conviction forced upon Montague's mind, not altogether
pleasant, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) money was being made to disappear without any
consent given by him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>), and that it behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) to be cautious lest
such consent should be extracted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) unawares.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has become of the mill?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have put an agent into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is not that dangerous? What check have you on him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) pays us a fixed sum, sir. But, my word! when there is such a
thing as this on hand a trumpery mill like that is not worth speaking
of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't sold it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--no. But we've arranged a price for a sale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't taken the money for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--yes; we have. We've raised money on it, you know. You see you
weren't there, and so the two resident partners acted for the firm.
But Mr. Montague, you'd better go with us. You had indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And about my own income?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a flea-bite. When we've got a little ahead with this it won't
matter, sir, whether you spend twenty thousand or forty thousand
dollars a year. We've got the concession from the United States
Government through the territories, and we're in correspondence with
the President of the Mexican Republic. I've no doubt we've an office
open already in Mexico and another at Vera Cruz.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the money to come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Money to come from, sir? Where do you suppose the money comes from
in all these undertakings? If we can float the shares, the money'll
come in quick enough. We hold three million dollars of the stock
ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Six hundred thousand pounds!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Montague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We take them at par, of course,--and as we sell we shall pay for
them. But of course we shall only sell at a premium. If we can run
them up even to 110, there would be three hundred thousand dollars.
But we'll do better than that. I must try and see Melmotte at once.
You had better write a letter now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know the man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind. Look here--I'll write it, and you can sign it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fisker/MR. FISKER</b></font>)</div>Whereupon Mr. Fisker did write the following letter:--


<p/>Langham Hotel, London.
March 4, 18--.

<p/>DEAR SIR,--I have the pleasure of informing you that my
partner, Mr. Fisker,--of Fisker, Montague, and Montague,
of San Francisco,--is now in London with the view of
allowing British capitalists to assist in carrying out
perhaps the greatest work of the age,--namely, the South
Central Pacific and Mexican Railway, which is to give
direct communication between San Francisco and the Gulf
of Mexico. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) is very anxious to see you upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) arrival,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) is aware that your co-operation would be desirable.
We feel assured that with your matured judgment in such
matters you would see at once the magnificence of the
enterprise. If you will name a day and an hour, Mr. Fisker
will call upon you.

<p/>I have to thank you and Madame Melmotte for a very
pleasant evening spent at your house last week.

<p/>Mr. Fisker proposes returning to New York. I shall remain
here, superintending the British interests which may be
involved.

<p/>I have the honour to be,
Dear Sir,
Most faithfully yours,

<p/>-- --.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have never said that I would superintend the interests,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said
Montague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can say so now. It binds you to nothing. You regular John Bull
Englishmen are so full of scruples that you lose as much of life as
should serve to make an additional fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>After some further conversation Paul Montague recopied the letter
and signed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) did it with doubt,--almost with dismay. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) could do no good by refusing. If this wretched
American, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) hat on one side and rings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) fingers, had so
far got the upper hand of Paul's uncle as to have been allowed to do
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) liked with the funds of the partnership, Paul could not stop
it. On the following morning they went up to London together, and in
the course of the afternoon Mr. Fisker presented himself in Abchurch
Lane. The letter written at Liverpool, but dated from the Langham
Hotel, had been posted at the Euston Square Railway Station at the
moment of Fisker's arrival. Fisker sent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) card, and was asked to
wait. In the course of twenty minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was ushered into the great
man's presence by no less a person than Miles Grendall.

<p/>It has been already said that Mr. Melmotte was a big man with large
whiskers, rough hair, and with an expression of mental power on
a harsh vulgar face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was certainly a man to repel you by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
presence unless attracted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) by some internal consideration.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was magnificent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) expenditure, powerful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) doings,
successful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) business, and the world around him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) therefore
was not repelled. Fisker, on the other hand, was a shining little
man,--perhaps about forty years of age, with a well-twisted
moustache, greasy brown hair, which was becoming bald at the top,
good-looking if his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) features were analysed, but insignificant
in appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was gorgeously dressed, with a silk waistcoat
and chains, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) carried a little stick. One would at first be
inclined to say that Fisker was not much of a man; but after a little
conversation most men would own that there was something in Fisker.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was troubled by no shyness, by no scruples, and by no fears. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
mind was not capacious, but such as it was it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
knew how to use it.

<p/>Abchurch Lane is not a grand site for the offices of a merchant
prince. Here, at a small corner house, there was a small brass plate
on a swing door, bearing the words <div class="bookquote">``Melmotte & Co.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte & Co./Co.</b></font>)</div>Of whom the Co.
was composed no one knew. In one sense Mr. Melmotte might be said
to be in company with all the commercial world, for there was no
business to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) co-operation on certain terms.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had never burthened himself with a partner in the usual sense
of the term. Here Fisker found three or four clerks seated at desks,
and was desired to walk up-stairs. The steps were narrow and crooked,
and the rooms were small and irregular. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) stayed for a while in
a small dark apartment in which <div class="bookquote">``The Daily Telegraph''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was left for
the amusement of its occupant till Miles Grendall announced to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
that Mr. Melmotte would see him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). The millionaire looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) for a
moment or two, just condescending to touch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) fingers the hand
which Fisker had projected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't seem to remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the gentleman who has done me
the honour of writing to me about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not, Mr. Melmotte. When I'm at home in San Francisco,
I make acquaintance with a great many gents whom I don't remember
afterwards. My partner I think told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) went to your house
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) friend, Sir Felix Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know a young man called Sir Felix Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it. I could have got any amount of introductions to you if I
had thought this would not have sufficed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Mr. Melmotte bowed. <div class="bookquote">``Our
account here in London is kept with the City and West End Joint
Stock. But I have only just arrived, and as my chief object in coming
to London is to see you, and as I met my partner, Mr. Montague, in
Liverpool, I took a note from him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) and came on straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what can I do for you, Mr. Fisker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fisker/MR. FISKER</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Fisker began his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) account of the Great South Central Pacific
and Mexican Railway, and exhibited considerable skill by telling it
all in comparatively few words. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was gorgeous and florid.
In two minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had displayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) programme, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) maps, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
pictures before Mr. Melmotte's eyes, taking care that Mr. Melmotte
should see how often the names of Fisker, Montague, and Montague,
reappeared upon them. As Mr. Melmotte read the documents, Fisker
from time to time put in a word. But the words had no reference at
all to the future profits of the railway, or to the benefit which
such means of communication would confer upon the world at large;
but applied solely to the appetite for such stock as theirs, which
might certainly be produced in the speculating world by a proper
manipulation of the affairs.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Then Mr. Fisker began his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) account.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to think you couldn't get it taken up in your own country,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not a doubt about getting it all taken up there. Our folk,
sir, are quick enough at the game; but you don't want me to teach
you, Mr. Melmotte, that nothing encourages this kind of thing like
competition. When they hear at St. Louis and Chicago that the thing
is alive in London, they'll be alive there. And it's the same here,
sir. When they know that the stock is running like wildfire in
America, they'll make it run here too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How far have you got?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What we've gone to work upon is a concession for making the line
from the United States Congress. We're to have the land for nothing,
of course, and a grant of one thousand acres round every station, the
stations to be twenty-five miles apart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the land is to be made over to you,--when?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When we have made the line up to the station.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>Fisker understood
perfectly that Mr. Melmotte did not ask the question in reference to
any value that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might attach to the possession of such lands, but
to the attractiveness of such a prospectus in the eyes of the outside
world of speculators.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you want me to do, Mr. Fisker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to have your name there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) finger
down on a spot on which it was indicated that there was, or was to
be, a chairman of an English Board of Directors, but with a space for
the name, hitherto blank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are to be your directors here, Mr. Fisker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We should ask you to choose them, sir. Mr. Paul Montague should be
one, and perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) friend Sir Felix Carbury might be another. We
could get probably one of the Directors of the City and West End. But
we would leave it all to you,--as also the amount of stock you would
like to take yourself. If you gave yourself to it, heart and soul,
Mr. Melmotte, it would be the finest thing that there has been out
for a long time. There would be such a mass of stock!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have to back that with a certain amount of paid-up capital?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We take care, sir, in the West not to cripple commerce too closely
by old-fashioned bandages. Look at what we've done already, sir, by
having our limbs pretty free. Look at our line, sir, right across the
continent, from San Francisco to New York. Look at--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that, Mr. Fisker. People wanted to go from New York to
San Francisco, and I don't know that they do want to go to Vera Cruz.
But I will look at it, and you shall hear from me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fisker/MR. FISKER</b></font>)</div>The interview
was over, and Mr. Fisker was contented with it. Had Mr. Melmotte not
intended at least to think of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would not have given ten minutes
to the subject. After all, what was wanted from Mr. Melmotte was
little more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) name, for the use of which Mr. Fisker proposed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) should receive from the speculative public two or three
hundred thousand pounds.

<p/>At the end of a fortnight from the date of Mr. Fisker's arrival
in London, the company was fully launched in England, with a body
of London directors, of whom Mr. Melmotte was the chairman. Among
the directors were Lord Alfred Grendall, Sir Felix Carbury, Samuel
Cohenlupe, Esq., Member of Parliament for Staines, a gentleman of
the Jewish persuasion, Lord Nidderdale, who was also in Parliament,
and Mr. Paul Montague. It may be thought that the directory was not
strong, and that but little help could be given to any commercial
enterprise by the assistance of Lord Alfred or Sir Felix;--but it was
felt that Mr. Melmotte was himself so great a tower of strength that
the fortune of the company,--as a company,--was made.




<p/>CHAPTER X.

<p/>MR. FISKER``S SUCCESS.


<p/>Mr. Fisker was fully satisfied with the progress he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had made, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) never quite succeeded in reconciling Paul Montague to the whole
transaction. Mr. Melmotte was indeed so great a reality, such a fact
in the commercial world of London, that it was no longer possible for
such a one as Montague to refuse to believe in the scheme. Melmotte
had the telegraph at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) command, and had been able to make as close
inquiries as though San Francisco and Salt Lake City had been suburbs
of London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was chairman of the British branch of the Company, and
had had shares allocated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>),--or as he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) said to the house,--to the
extent of two millions of dollars. But still there was a feeling of
doubt, and a consciousness that Melmotte, though a tower of strength,
was thought by many to have been built upon the sands.

<p/>Paul had now of course given his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) full authority to the work, much
in opposition to the advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) old friend Roger Carbury,--and
had come up to live in town, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might personally attend to
the affairs of the great railway. There was an office just behind
the Exchange, with two or three clerks and a secretary, the latter
position being held by Miles Grendall, Esq.. Paul, who had a
conscience in the matter and was keenly alive to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was
not only a director but was also one of the firm of Fisker, Montague,
and Montague which was responsible for the whole affair, was
grievously anxious to be really at work, and would attend most
inopportunely at the Company's offices. Fisker, who still lingered in
London, did his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) best to put a stop to this folly, and on more than
one occasion somewhat snubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) partner. <div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, what's
the use of your flurrying yourself? In a thing of this kind, when it
has once been set agoing, there is nothing else to do. You may have
to work your fingers off before you can make it move, and then fail.
But all that has been done for you. If you go there on the Thursdays
that's quite as much as you need do. You don't suppose that such
a man as Melmotte would put up with any real interference.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul
endeavoured to assert himself, declaring that as one of the managers
he (<font color='blue'><b>FISKER</b></font>) meant to take a part in the management;--that his (<font color='blue'><b>FISKER</b></font>) fortune, such as
it was, had been embarked in the matter, and was as important to him (<font color='blue'><b>FISKER</b></font>)
as was Mr. Melmotte's fortune to Mr. Melmotte. But Fisker got the
better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) down. <div class="bookquote">``Fortune! what fortune had either of
us? a few beggarly thousands of dollars not worth talking of, and
barely sufficient to enable a man to look at an enterprise. And now
where are you? Look here, sir;--there's more to be got out of the
smashing up of such an affair as this, if it should smash up, than
could be made by years of hard work out of such fortunes as yours and
mine in the regular way of trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul Montague certainly did not love Mr. Fisker personally, nor did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) relish his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) commercial doctrines; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) allowed himself to be
carried away by them. <div class="bookquote">``When and how was I to have helped myself?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
wrote to Roger Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``The money had been raised and spent before
this man came here at all. It's all very well to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no
right to do it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done it. I couldn't even have gone to law
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without going over to California, and then I should have
got no redress.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Through it all he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) disliked Fisker, and yet Fisker
had one great merit which certainly recommended itself warmly to
Montague's appreciation. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) denied the propriety of Paul's
interference in the business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) quite acknowledged Paul's right to a
share in the existing dash of prosperity. As to the real facts of the
money affairs of the firm he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) would tell Paul nothing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was well
provided with money himself, and took care that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) partner should be
in the same position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) all the arrears of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) stipulated
income up to the present moment, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) nominally into
possession of a large number of shares in the railway,--with,
however, an understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was not to sell them till they had
reached ten per cent. above par, and that in any sale transacted he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
was to touch no other money than the amount of profit which would
thus accrue. What Melmotte was to be allowed to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) shares,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) never heard. As far as Montague could understand, Melmotte was in
truth to be powerful over everything. All this made the young man
unhappy, restless, and extravagant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was living in London and had
money at command, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) never could rid himself of the fear that
the whole affair might tumble to pieces beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) feet and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
might be stigmatised as one among a gang of swindlers.

<p/>We all know how, in such circumstances, by far the greater proportion
of a man's life will be given up to the enjoyments that are offered
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the lesser proportion to the cares, sacrifices, and
sorrows. Had this young director been describing to his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) intimate
friend the condition in which he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) found himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) would have
declared himself to be distracted by doubts, suspicions, and fears
till his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) life was a burden to him (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>). And yet they who were living with
him (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) at this time found him (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) to be a very pleasant fellow, fond of
amusement, and disposed to make the most of all the good things which
came in his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) way. Under the auspices of Sir Felix Carbury he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) had
become a member of the Beargarden, at which best of all possible
clubs the mode of entrance was as irregular as its other proceedings.
When any young man desired to come in who was thought to be unfit
for its style of living, it was shown to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that it would take
three years before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name could be brought up at the usual rate
of vacancies; but in regard to desirable companions the committee
had a power of putting them at the top of the list of candidates and
bringing them in at once. Paul Montague had suddenly become credited
with considerable commercial wealth and greater commercial influence.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat at the same Board with Melmotte and Melmotte's men; and was on
this account elected at the Beargarden without any of that harassing
delay to which other less fortunate candidates are subjected.

<p/>And,--let it be said with regret, for Paul Montague was at heart
honest and well-conditioned,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took to living a good deal at the
Beargarden. A man must dine somewhere, and everybody knows that a man
dines cheaper at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) club than elsewhere. It was thus he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reasoned
with himself. But Paul's dinners at the Beargarden were not cheap. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
saw a good deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother directors, Sir Felix Carbury and Lord
Nidderdale, entertained Lord Alfred more than once at the club, and
had twice dined with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) great chairman amidst all the magnificence
of merchant-princely hospitality in Grosvenor Square. It had indeed
been suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) by Mr. Fisker that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) also ought to enter
himself for the great Marie Melmotte plate. Lord Nidderdale had again
declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) intention of running, owing to considerable pressure put
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) by certain interested tradesmen, and with this intention
had become one of the directors of the Mexican Railway Company. At
the time, however, of which we are now writing, Sir Felix was the
favourite for the race among fashionable circles generally.

<p/>The middle of April had come, and Fisker was still in London. When
millions of dollars are at stake,--belonging perhaps to widows
and orphans, as Fisker remarked,--a man was forced to set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
convenience on one side. But this devotion was not left without
reward, for Mr. Fisker had <div class="bookquote">``a good time''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fisker/MR. FISKER</b></font>)</div>in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) also was made
free of the Beargarden, as an honorary member, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) also spent
a good deal of money. But there is this comfort in great affairs,
that whatever you spend on yourself can be no more than a trifle.
Champagne and ginger-beer are all the same when you stand to win or
lose thousands,--with this only difference, that champagne may have
deteriorating results which the more innocent beverage will not
produce. The feeling that the greatness of these operations relieved
them from the necessity of looking to small expenses operated in the
champagne direction, both on Fisker and Montague, and the result was
deleterious. The Beargarden, no doubt, was a more lively place than
Carbury Manor, but Montague found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) could not wake up on these
London mornings with thoughts as satisfactory as those which attended
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) pillow at the old Manor House.

<p/>On Saturday, the 19th of April, Fisker was to leave London on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
return to New York, and on the 18th a farewell dinner was to be given
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) at the club. Mr. Melmotte was asked to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and on such
an occasion all the resources of the club were to be brought forth.
Lord Alfred Grendall was also to be a guest, and Mr. Cohenlupe, who
went about a good deal with Melmotte. Nidderdale, Carbury, Montague,
and Miles Grendall were members of the club, and gave the dinner. No
expense was spared. Herr Vossner purveyed the viands and wines,--and
paid for them. Lord Nidderdale took the chair, with Fisker on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
right hand, and Melmotte on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) left, and, for a fast-going young
lord, was supposed to have done the thing well. There were only two
toasts drunk, to the healths of Mr. Melmotte and Mr. Fisker, and two
speeches were of course made by them. Mr. Melmotte may have been held
to have clearly proved the genuineness of that English birth which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) claimed by the awkwardness and incapacity which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) showed on the
occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands on the table and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face
turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) plate blurted out his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) assurance that the floating of
this railway company would be one of the greatest and most successful
commercial operations ever conducted on either side of the Atlantic.
It was a great thing,--a very great thing;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had no hesitation in
saying that it was one of the greatest things out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) didn't believe
a greater thing had ever come out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was happy to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) humble
assistance to the furtherance of so great a thing,--and so on. These
assertions, not varying much one from the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) jerked out like
so many separate interjections, endeavouring to look his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) friends in
the face at each, and then turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) countenance back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) plate
as though seeking for inspiration for the next attempt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not
eloquent; but the gentlemen who heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was the
great Augustus Melmotte, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might probably make them all rich
men, and they cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to the echo. Lord Alfred had reconciled
himself to be called by his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) Christian name, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) had been put in
the way of raising two or three hundred pounds on the security of
shares which were to be allotted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), but of which in the flesh
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) had as yet seen nothing. Wonderful are the ways of trade! If one
can only get the tip of one's little finger into the right pie,
what noble morsels, what rich esculents, will stick to it as it is
extracted!

<p/>When Melmotte sat down Fisker made his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) speech, and it was fluent,
fast, and florid. Without giving it word for word, which would be
tedious, I could not adequately set before the reader's eye the
speaker's pleasing picture of world-wide commercial love and harmony
which was to be produced by a railway from Salt Lake City to Vera
Cruz, nor explain the extent of gratitude from the world at large
which might be claimed by, and would finally be accorded to, the
great firms of Melmotte & Co. of London, and Fisker, Montague, and
Montague of San Francisco. Mr. Fisker's arms were waved gracefully
about. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) head was turned now this way and now that, but never
towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) plate. It was very well done. But there was more faith
in one ponderous word from Mr. Melmotte's mouth than in all the
American's oratory.

<p/>There was not one of them then present who had not after some fashion
been given to understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) fortune was to be made, not by
the construction of the railway, but by the floating of the railway
shares. They had all whispered to each other their convictions on
this head. Even Montague did not beguile himself into an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
was really a director in a company to be employed in the making and
working of a railway. People out of doors were to be advertised into
buying shares, and they who were so to say indoors were to have the
privilege of manufacturing the shares thus to be sold. That was to
be their work, and they all knew it. But now, as there were eight of
them collected together, they talked of humanity at large and of the
coming harmony of nations.

<p/>After the first cigar, Melmotte withdrew, and Lord Alfred went with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>). Lord Alfred would have liked to remain, being a man who enjoyed
tobacco and soda and brandy,--but momentous days had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) thought it well to cling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) Melmotte. Mr. Samuel Cohenlupe
also went, not having taken a very distinguished part in the
entertainment. Then the young men were left alone, and it was soon
proposed that they should adjourn to the cardroom. It had been rather
hoped that Fisker would go with the elders. Nidderdale, who did not
understand much about the races of mankind, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) doubts whether
the American gentleman might not be a <div class="bookquote">``Heathen Chinee,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
had read of in poetry. But Mr. Fisker liked to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) amusement
as well as did the others, and went up resolutely into the cardroom.
Here they were joined by Lord Grasslough, and were very quickly at
work, having chosen loo as their game. Mr. Fisker made an allusion to
poker as a desirable pastime, but Lord Nidderdale, remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
poetry, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! bother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``let's have some game
that Christians play.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Fisker declared himself ready for any
game,--irrespective of religious prejudices.

<p/>It must be explained that the gambling at the Beargarden had gone
on with very little interruption, and that on the whole Sir Felix
Carbury kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) luck. There had of course been vicissitudes, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) star had been in the ascendant. For some nights together this
had been so continual that Mr. Miles Grendall had suggested to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
friend Lord Grasslough that there must be foul play. Lord Grasslough,
who had not many good gifts, was, at least, not suspicious, and
repudiated the idea. <div class="bookquote">``We'll keep an eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>Miles Grendall had
said. <div class="bookquote">``You may do as you like, but I'm not going to watch any one,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>Grasslough had replied. Miles had watched, and had watched in vain,
and it may as well be said at once that Sir Felix, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
faults, was not as yet a blackleg. Both of them now owed Sir Felix a
considerable sum of money, as did also Dolly Longestaffe, who was not
present on this occasion. Latterly very little ready money had passed
hands,--very little in proportion to the sums which had been written
down on paper,--though Sir Felix was still so well in funds as to
feel himself justified in repudiating any caution that his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mother
might give him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>).

<p/>When I.O.U.``s have for some time passed freely in such a company as
that now assembled the sudden introduction of a stranger is very
disagreeable, particularly when that stranger intends to start for
San Francisco on the following morning. If it could be arranged
that the stranger should certainly lose, no doubt then he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would be
regarded as a godsend. Such strangers have ready money in their
pockets, a portion of which would be felt to descend like a soft
shower in a time of drought. When these dealings in unsecured paper
have been going on for a considerable time real bank notes come to
have a loveliness which they never possessed before. But should the
stranger win, then there may arise complications incapable of any
comfortable solution. In such a state of things some Herr Vossner
must be called in, whose terms are apt to be ruinous. On this
occasion things did not arrange themselves comfortably. From the
very commencement Fisker won, and quite a budget of little papers
fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) possession, many of which were passed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) from the
hands of Sir Felix,--bearing, however, a ``G'' intended to stand for
Grasslough, or an ``N'' for Nidderdale, or a wonderful hieroglyphic
which was known at the Beargarden to mean D. L--, or Dolly
Longestaffe, the fabricator of which was not present on the occasion.
Then there was the M. G. of Miles Grendall, which was a species of
paper peculiarly plentiful and very unattractive on these commercial
occasions. Paul Montague hitherto had never given an I.O.U. at
the Beargarden,--nor of late had our friend Sir Felix. On the
present occasion Montague won, though not heavily. Sir Felix lost
continually, and was almost the only loser. But Mr. Fisker won nearly
all that was lost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was to start for Liverpool by train at 8.30
A.M., and at 6 A.M. he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) counted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) bits of paper and found himself
the winner of about #600. <div class="bookquote">``I think that most of them came from you,
Sir Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) said,--handing the bundle across the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say they did, but they are all good against these other
fellows.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>Then Fisker, with most perfect good humour, extracted one
from the mass which indicated Dolly Longestaffe's indebtedness to the
amount of #50. <div class="bookquote">``That's Longestaffe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll change
that of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Then out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) pocket-book he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) extracted other
minute documents bearing that M. G. which was so little esteemed
among them,--and so made up the sum. <div class="bookquote">``You seem to have #150 from
Grasslough, #145 from Nidderdale, and #322 10_s._ from Grendall,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet. Then Sir Felix got up as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
score. Fisker, with smiling good humour, arranged the little bits of
paper before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) and looked round upon the company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This won't do, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fisker must have his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
money before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) leaves. You've got it, Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) has,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Grasslough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As it happens I have not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix;--<div class="bookquote">``but what if I had?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fisker starts for New York immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale.
``I suppose we can muster #600 among us. Ring the bell for Vossner.
I think Carbury ought to pay the money as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) lost it, and we didn't
expect to have our I.O.U.<div class="bookquote">``s brought up in this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Nidderdale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, ``I have already said that I have
not got the money about me. Why should I have it more than you,
especially as I knew I had I.O.U.<div class="bookquote">``s more than sufficient to meet
anything I could lose when I sat down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fisker must have his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) money at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale,
ringing the bell again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter one straw, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>the American</b></font>)</div>said the American. <div class="bookquote">``Let it be
sent to me to Frisco, in a bill, my lord.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) got up to take
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) hat, greatly to the delight of Miles Grendall.

<p/>But the two young lords would not agree to this. <div class="bookquote">``If you must go
this very minute I'll meet you at the train with the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said
Nidderdale. Fisker begged that no such trouble should be taken. Of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) would wait ten minutes if they wished. But the affair was
one of no consequence. Wasn't the post running every day? Then Herr
Vossner came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) bed, suddenly arrayed in a dressing-gown, and
there was a conference in a corner between him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>), the two lords, and
Mr. Grendall. In a very few minutes Herr Vossner wrote a cheque
for the amount due by the lords, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) was afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) had not
money at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) banker's sufficient for the greater claim. It was well
understood that Herr Vossner would not advance money to Mr. Grendall
unless others would pledge themselves for the amount.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I'd better send you a bill over to America,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles
Grendall, who had taken no part in the matter as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was in
the same boat with the lords.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so. My partner, Montague, will tell you the address.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Then
bustling off, taking an affectionate adieu of Paul, shaking hands
with them all round, and looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) cared nothing for the
money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) leave. <div class="bookquote">``One cheer for the South Central Pacific
and Mexican Railway,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) went out of the room.

<p/>Not one there had liked Fisker. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) manners were not as their
manners; his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) waistcoat not as their waistcoats. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) cigar
after a fashion different from theirs, and spat upon the carpet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
said <div class="bookquote">``my lord''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>too often, and grated their prejudices equally whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) treated them with familiarity or deference. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had behaved
well about the money, and they felt that they were behaving badly.
Sir Felix was the immediate offender, as he (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) should have understood
that he (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) was not entitled to pay a stranger with documents which, by
tacit contract, were held to be good among themselves. But there was
no use now in going back to that. Something must be done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vossner must get the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``Let's have him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) up
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it's my fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles. <div class="bookquote">``Of course no one thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was to be called upon in this sort of way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't you be called upon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``You acknowledge
that you owe the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Carbury ought to have paid it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Grasslough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grassy, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, <div class="bookquote">``your attempts at thinking are
never worth much. Why was I to suppose that a stranger would be
playing among us? Had you a lot of ready money with you to pay if you
had lost it? I don't always walk about with six hundred pounds in my
pocket;--nor do you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good jawing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale; <div class="bookquote">``let's get the money.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Then
Montague offered to undertake the debt himself, saying that there
were money transactions between him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) partner. But this could
not be allowed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had only lately come among them, had as yet had no
dealing in I.O.U.``s, and was the last man in the company who ought
to be made responsible for the impecuniosity of Miles Grendall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>),
the impecunious one,--the one whose impecuniosity extended to the
absolute want of credit,--sat silent, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) heavy moustache.

<p/>There was a second conference between Herr Vossner and the two
lords in another room, which ended in the preparation of a document
by which Miles Grendall undertook to pay to Herr Vossner #450 at
the end of three months, and this was endorsed by the two lords,
by Sir Felix, and by Paul Montague; and in return for this the
German produced #322 10_s._ in notes and gold. This had taken some
considerable time. Then a cup of tea was prepared and swallowed;
after which Nidderdale, with Montague, started off to meet Fisker at
the railway station. <div class="bookquote">``It'll only be a trifle over #100 each,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said
Nidderdale, in the cab.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't Mr. Grendall pay it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear no. How the devil should he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) shouldn't play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That 'd be hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), poor fellow. If you went to his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) uncle the
duke, I suppose you could get it. Or Buntingford might put it right
for you. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) might win, you know, some day, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'d make
it square. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'d be fair enough if he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had it. Poor Miles!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div><p/>They found Fisker wonderfully brilliant with bright rugs, and
greatcoats with silk linings. <div class="bookquote">``We've brought you the tin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said
Nidderdale, accosting him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) on the platform.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, my lord, I'm sorry you have taken so much trouble
about such a trifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man should always have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't think anything about such little matters at Frisco, my
lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're fine fellows at Frisco, I dare say. Here we pay up,--when we
can. Sometimes we can't, and then it is not pleasant.''  (<font color='red'><b>the partners</b></font>)</div>Fresh adieus
were made between the two partners, and between the American and the
lord;--and then Fisker was taken off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) way towards Frisco. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'s
not half a bad fellow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'s not a bit like an Englishman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said
Lord Nidderdale, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) walked out of the station.




<p/>CHAPTER XI.

<p/>LADY CARBURY AT HOME.


<p/>During the last six weeks Lady Carbury had lived a life of very mixed
depression and elevation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) great work had come out,--the <div class="bookquote">``Criminal
Queens,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and had been very widely reviewed. In this matter it had
been by no means all pleasure, in as much as many very hard words had
been said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). In spite of the dear friendship between herself and
Mr. Alf, one of Mr. Alf's most sharp-nailed subordinates had been
set upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) book, and had pulled it to pieces with almost rabid
malignity. One would have thought that so slight a thing could hardly
have been worthy of such protracted attention. Error after error
was laid bare with merciless prolixity. No doubt the writer of the
article must have had all history at his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) finger-ends, as in pointing
out the various mistakes made he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) always spoke of the historical facts
which had been misquoted, misdated, or misrepresented, as being
familiar in all their bearings to every schoolboy of twelve years
old. The writer of the criticism never suggested the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
himself, having been fully provided with books of reference, and
having learned the art of finding in them what he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) wanted at a
moment's notice, had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) work, checked off the
blunders without any more permanent knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) own than a
housekeeper has of coals when she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) counts so many sacks into the
coal-cellar. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) spoke of the parentage of one wicked ancient lady,
and the dates of the frailties of another, with an assurance intended
to show that an exact knowledge of all these details abided with him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
always. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) must have been a man of vast and varied erudition, and his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
name was Jones. The world knew him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) not, but his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) erudition was always
there at the command of Mr. Alf,--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) cruelty. The greatness of
Mr. Alf consisted in this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) always had a Mr. Jones or two
ready to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) work for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>). It was a great business, this of Mr.
Alf's, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) Jones also for philology, for science, for
poetry, for politics, as well as for history, and one special Jones,
extraordinarily accurate and very well posted up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) references,
entirely devoted to the Elizabethan drama.

<p/>There is the review intended to sell a book,--which comes out
immediately after the appearance of the book, or sometimes before
it; the review which gives reputation, but does not affect the sale,
and which comes a little later; the review which snuffs a book out
quietly; the review which is to raise or lower the author a single
peg, or two pegs, as the case may be; the review which is suddenly to
make an author, and the review which is to crush him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>). An exuberant
Jones has been known before now to declare aloud that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) would crush
a man, and a self-confident Jones has been known to declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
has accomplished the deed. Of all reviews, the crushing review is the
most popular, as being the most readable. When the rumour goes abroad
that some notable man has been actually crushed,--been positively
driven over by an entire Juggernaut's car of criticism till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
literary body be a mere amorphous mass,--then a real success has been
achieved, and the Alf of the day has done a great thing; but even
the crushing of a poor Lady Carbury, if it be absolute, is effective.
Such a review will not make all the world call for the <div class="bookquote">``Evening
Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but it will cause those who do take the paper to be
satisfied with their bargain. Whenever the circulation of such a
paper begins to slacken, the proprietors should, as a matter of
course, admonish their Alf to add a little power to the crushing
department.

<p/>Lady Carbury had been crushed by the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>We may fancy
that it was easy work, and that Mr. Alf's historical Mr. Jones
was not forced to fatigue himself by the handling of many books
of reference. The errors did lie a little near the surface; and
the whole scheme of the work, with its pandering to bad tastes by
pretended revelations of frequently fabulous crime, was reprobated in
Mr. Jones's very best manner. But the poor authoress, though utterly
crushed, and reduced to little more than literary pulp for an hour
or two, was not destroyed. On the following morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) went to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) publishers, and was closeted for half an hour with the senior
partner, Mr. Leadham. <div class="bookquote">``I've got it all in black and white,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) said,
full of the wrong which had been done her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), ``and can prove him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) to
be wrong. It was in 1522 that the man first came to Paris, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
couldn't have been her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lover before that. I got it all out of the
``Biographie Universelle.<div class="bookquote">'' I'll write to Mr. Alf myself,--a letter to
be published, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't do anything of the kind, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can prove that I'm right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they can prove that you're wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got all the facts,--and the figures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leadham/Leadham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leadham did not care a straw for facts or figures,--had no
opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) own whether the lady or the reviewer were right; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) knew very well that the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>would surely get the
better of any mere author in such a contention. <div class="bookquote">``Never fight the
newspapers, Lady Carbury. Who ever yet got any satisfaction by that
kind of thing? It's their business, and you are not used to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Alf is my particular friend! It does seem so hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said
Lady Carbury, wiping hot tears from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't do us the least harm, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll stop the sale?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Not much. A book of that sort couldn't hope to go on very long, you
know. The ``Breakfast Table' gave it an excellent lift, and came just
at the right time. I rather like the notice in the <div class="bookquote">``Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>myself.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, still suffering in every fibre of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) self-love from the soreness produced by those Juggernaut's
car-wheels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything is better than indifference, Lady Carbury. A great many
people remember simply that the book has been noticed, but carry
away nothing as to the purport of the review. It's a very good
advertisement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to be told that I have got to learn the ABC of history,--after
working as I have worked!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a mere form of speech, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think the book has done pretty well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well;--just about what we hoped, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There'll be something coming to me, Mr. Leadham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leadham/Leadham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Leadham sent for a ledger, and turned over a few pages and ran up
a few figures, and then scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) head. There would be something,
but Lady Carbury was not to imagine that it could be very much. It
did not often happen that a great deal could be made by a first book.
Nevertheless, Lady Carbury, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) left the publisher's shop, did
carry a cheque with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was smartly dressed and looked very
well, and had smiled on Mr. Leadham. Mr. Leadham, too, was no more
than man, and had written--a small cheque.

<p/>Mr. Alf certainly had behaved badly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>); but both Mr. Broune of
the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Booker of the <div class="bookquote">``Literary Chronicle,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>had been true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) interests. Lady Carbury had, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) promised,
<div class="bookquote">``done''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Booker's <div class="bookquote">``New Tale of a Tub''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>in the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>That is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been allowed, as a reward for looking into Mr.
Broune's eyes, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) soft hand on Mr. Broune's sleeve,
and suggesting to Mr. Broune that no one understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) so well
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) did, to bedaub Mr. Booker's very thoughtful book in a very
thoughtless fashion,--and to be paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) work. What had been said
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) work in the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>had been very distasteful to
poor Mr. Booker. It grieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) inner contemplative intelligence that
such rubbish should be thrown upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>); but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) outside experience
of life he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) knew that even the rubbish was valuable, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>)
must pay for it in the manner to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) had unfortunately become
accustomed. So Mr. Booker himself wrote the article on the <div class="bookquote">``Criminal
Queens''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>in the <div class="bookquote">``Literary Chronicle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>knowing that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) wrote
would also be rubbish. <div class="bookquote">``Remarkable vivacity.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Power of delineating
character.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Excellent choice of subject.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Considerable intimacy
with the historical details of various periods.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The literary world
would be sure to hear of Lady Carbury again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>The composition of the
review, together with the reading of the book, consumed altogether
perhaps an hour of Mr. Booker's time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) made no attempt to cut the
pages, but here and there read those that were open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) had done this
kind of thing so often, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) knew well what he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) was about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) could
have reviewed such a book when he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) was three parts asleep. When the
work was done he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) pen and uttered a deep sigh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) felt
it to be hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) should be compelled, by the exigencies
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) position, to descend so low in literature; but it did not
occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) to reflect that in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) was not compelled, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) was quite at liberty to break stones, or to starve honestly, if no
other honest mode of carrying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) career was open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If I
didn't, somebody else would,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) said to himself.

<p/>But the review in the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>was the making of
Lady Carbury's book, as far as it ever was made. Mr. Broune saw the
lady after the receipt of the letter given in the first chapter of
this Tale, and was induced to make valuable promises which had been
fully performed. Two whole columns had been devoted to the work,
and the world had been assured that no more delightful mixture of
amusement and instruction had ever been concocted than Lady Carbury's
<div class="bookquote">``Criminal Queens.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>It was the very book that had been wanted for
years. It was a work of infinite research and brilliant imagination
combined. There had been no hesitation in the laying on of the paint.
At that last meeting Lady Carbury had been very soft, very handsome,
and very winning; Mr. Broune had given the order with good will, and
it had been obeyed in the same feeling.

<p/>Therefore, though the crushing had been very real, there had also
been some elation; and as a net result, Lady Carbury was disposed to
think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) literary career might yet be a success. Mr. Leadham's
cheque had been for a small amount, but it might probably lead the
way to something better. People at any rate were talking about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) Tuesday evenings at home were generally full. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
literary life, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) literary successes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) flirtations with Mr.
Broune, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) business with Mr. Booker, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) crushing by Mr. Alf's
Mr. Jones, were after all but adjuncts to that real inner life of
hers of which the absorbing interest was her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son. And with regard to
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) too she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was partly depressed, and partly elated, allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
hopes however to dominate her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) fears. There was very much to frighten
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). Even the moderate reform in the young man's expenses which had
been effected under dire necessity had been of late abandoned. Though
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) became aware that during the last
month of the hunting season he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hunted nearly every day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew,
too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a horse up in town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but once in
the day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) visited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed about noon, and was aware
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) club throughout the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gambling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hated gambling as being of all pastimes
the most dangerous. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ready money for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
immediate purposes, and that two or three tradesmen who were gifted
with a peculiar power of annoying their debtors, had ceased to
trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in Welbeck Street. For the present, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
consoled herself by reflecting that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gambling was successful. But
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) elation sprung from a higher source than this. From all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
could hear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought it likely that Felix would carry off the
great prize; and then,--should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do that,--what a blessed son would
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) have been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)! How constantly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) triumph would she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) be able
to forget all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) vices, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) debts, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) gambling, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) late hours, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cruel treatment of herself! As she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) thought of it the bliss seemed
to be too great for the possibility of realisation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was taught to
understand that #10,000 a year, to begin with, would be the least of
it; and that the ultimate wealth might probably be such as to make
Sir Felix Carbury the richest commoner in England. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) very heart
of hearts she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) worshipped wealth, but desired it for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rather than
for herself. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind ran away to baronies and earldoms, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was lost in the coming glories of the boy whose faults had already
nearly engulfed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own ruin.

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had another ground for elation, which comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) much,
though elation from such a cause was altogether absurd. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
discovered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son had become a Director of the South Central
Pacific and Mexican Railway Company. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) must have known,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
certainly did know,--that Felix, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) was, could not lend
assistance by his (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) work to any company or commercial enterprise in the
world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was aware that there was some reason for such a choice
hidden from the world, and which comprised and conveyed a falsehood.
A ruined baronet of five-and-twenty, every hour of whose life
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) had been left to go alone had been loaded with vice and
folly,--whose egregious misconduct warranted his (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) friends in regarding
him (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) as one incapable of knowing what principle is,--of what service
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) be, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) should be made a Director? But Lady Carbury,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) could be of no service, was not at all
shocked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was now able to speak up a little for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) boy, and did
not forget to send the news by post to Roger Carbury. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son sat
at the same Board with Mr. Melmotte! What an indication was this of
coming triumphs!

<p/>Fisker had started, as the reader will perhaps remember, on the
morning of Saturday, 19th April, leaving Sir Felix at the Club at
about seven in the morning. All that day his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) mother was unable to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) room at noon and again at two; and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) again he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had flown. But on the Sunday she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) caught
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you'll stay at home on Tuesday evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had never succeeded in inducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) to grace her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) evening
parties by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All your people are coming! You know, mother, it is such an awful
bore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame Melmotte and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter will be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One looks such a fool carrying on that kind of thing in one's own
house. Everybody sees that it has been contrived. And it is such a
pokey, stuffy little place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Lady Carbury spoke out her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``Felix, I think you must be a
fool. I have given over ever expecting that you would do anything
to please me. I sacrifice everything for you and I do not even hope
for a return. But when I am doing everything to advance your own
interests, when I am working night and day to rescue you from ruin, I
think you might at any rate help a little,--not for me of course, but
for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by working day and night. I don't want
you to work day and night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is hardly a young man in London that is not thinking of this
girl, and you have chances that none of them have. I am told they
are going out of town at Whitsuntide, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s to meet Lord
Nidderdale down in the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can't endure Nidderdale. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) says so herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will do as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is told,--unless she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can be made to be downright

Tuesday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'm to do it at all I must do it after my own fashion. I'm not

you really love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)! what a bother there is about loving! Well;--I'll look in.
What time do the animals come to feed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be no feeding. Felix, you are so heartless and so cruel
that I sometimes think I will make up my mind to let you go your own
way and never to speak to you again. My friends will be here about
ten;--I should say from ten till twelve. I think you should be here
to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), not later than ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can get my dinner out of my throat by that time, I will come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>When the Tuesday came, the over-driven young man did contrive to
get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dinner eaten, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass of brandy sipped, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cigar
smoked, and perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) game of billiards played, so as to present
himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's drawing-room not long after half-past ten.
Madame Melmotte and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter were already there,--and many
others, of whom the majority were devoted to literature. Among them
Mr. Alf was in the room, and was at this very moment discussing
Lady Carbury's book with Mr. Booker. He (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) had been quite graciously
received, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) had not authorised the crushing. Lady Carbury
had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand with that energy of affection with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was wont to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) literary friends, and had simply thrown one
glance of appeal into his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) face,--as
though asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) had found it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) heart to be so cruel
to one so tender, so unprotected, so innocent as herself. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot
stand this kind of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Alf, to Mr. Booker. <div class="bookquote">``There's a
regular system of touting got abroad, and I mean to trample it down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you're strong enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Booker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think I am. I'm strong enough, at any rate, to show that I'm
not afraid to lead the way. I've the greatest possible regard for our
friend here;--but her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) book is a bad book, a thoroughly rotten book,
an unblushing compilation from half-a-dozen works of established
reputation, in pilfering from which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has almost always managed to
misapprehend her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) facts, and to muddle her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dates. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) writes to
me and asks me to do the best I can for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I have done the best I
could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Alf knew very well what Mr. Booker had done, and Mr. Booker was
aware of the extent of Mr. Alf's knowledge. <div class="bookquote">``What you say is all very
right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Booker; <div class="bookquote">``only you want a different kind of world to
live in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div><p/>``Just so;--and therefore we must make it different. I wonder how our
friend Broune felt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) critic had declared that the
<div class="bookquote">``Criminal Queens' was the greatest historical work of modern days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't see the notice. There isn't much in the book, certainly, as
far as I have looked at it. I should have said that violent censure
or violent praise would be equally thrown away upon it. One doesn't
want to break a butterfly on the wheel;--especially a friendly
butterfly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the friendship, it should be kept separate. That's my idea,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Alf, moving away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll never forget what you've done for me,--never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Carbury, holding Mr. Broune's hand for a moment, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) whispered to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing more than my duty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>), smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll learn to know that a woman can really be grateful,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) replied. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) let go his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) hand and moved away to some other
guest. There was a dash of true sincerity in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had said. Of
enduring gratitude it may be doubtful whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was capable: but
at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did feel that Mr. Broune had done much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would willingly make him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) some return of friendship.
Of any feeling of another sort, of any turn at the moment towards
flirtation, of any idea of encouragement to a gentleman who had once
acted as though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was absolutely innocent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had forgotten that little absurd episode in their joint lives. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was at any rate too much in earnest at the present moment to think
about it. But it was otherwise with Mr. Broune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) could not quite
make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) mind whether the lady was or was not in love with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>),--or whether, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were, it was incumbent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) to indulge
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>);--and if so, in what manner. Then as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) told himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was certainly very beautiful, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
figure was distinguished, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) income was certain, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rank
considerable. Nevertheless, Mr. Broune knew of himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was
not a marrying man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) mind that marriage would not
suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) smiled to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) reflected how
impossible it was that such a one as Lady Carbury should turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) resolution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad that you have come to-night, Mr. Alf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury
said to the high-minded editor of the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I not always glad to come, Lady Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good. But I feared,--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Feared what, Lady Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you might perhaps have felt that I should be unwilling to
welcome you after,--well, after the compliments of last Thursday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never allow the two things to join themselves together. You see,
Lady Carbury, I don't write all these things myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed. What a bitter creature you would be if you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell the truth, I never write any of them. Of course we endeavour
to get people whose judgments we can trust, and if, as in this case,
it should unfortunately happen that the judgment of our critic should
be hostile to the literary pretensions of a personal friend of my
own, I can only lament the accident, and trust that my friend may
have spirit enough to divide me as an individual from that Mr. Alf
who has the misfortune to edit a newspaper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because you have so trusted me that I am obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said
Lady Carbury with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sweetest smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not believe a word that
Mr. Alf had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought, and thought rightly, that Mr.
Alf's Mr. Jones had taken direct orders from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) editor, as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
treatment of the <div class="bookquote">``Criminal Queens.''  (<font color='red'><b>editor</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
intended to write another book, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might perhaps conquer
even Mr. Alf by spirit and courage under her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) present infliction.

<p/>It was Lady Carbury's duty on the occasion to say pretty things to
everybody. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) duty. But in the midst of it all she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was
ever thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son and Marie Melmotte, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did at last
venture to separate the girl from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother. Marie herself was not
unwilling to be talked to by Sir Felix. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had never bullied her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), had
never seemed to scorn her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>); and then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was so beautiful! She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), poor
girl, bewildered among various suitors, utterly confused by the life
to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was introduced, troubled by fitful attacks of admonition
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father, who would again, fitfully, leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) unnoticed for
a week at a time; with no trust in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) pseudo-mother--for poor Marie
had in truth been born before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father had been a married man, and
had never known what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own mother's fate,--with no enjoyment in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) present life, had come solely to this conclusion, that it would
be well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to be taken away somewhere by somebody. Many a varied
phase of life had already come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could just remember
the dirty street in the German portion of New York in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had
been born and had lived for the first four years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) life, and
could remember too the poor, hardly-treated woman who had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could remember being at sea, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) sickness,--but could
not quite remember whether that woman had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had run about the streets of Hamburgh, and had sometimes been very
hungry, sometimes in rags,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a dim memory of some trouble
into which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father had fallen, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for a
time. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had up to the present splendid moment her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own convictions
about that absence, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never mentioned them to a human
being. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father had married her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) present mother in Francfort.
That she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could remember distinctly, as also the rooms in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was then taken to live, and the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was told that from
henceforth she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to be a Jewess. But there had soon come another
change. They went from Francfort to Paris, and there they were all
Christians. From that time they had lived in various apartments in
the French capital, but had always lived well. Sometimes there had
been a carriage, sometimes there had been none. And then there came
a time in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was grown woman enough to understand that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
father was being much talked about. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had always been
alternately capricious and indifferent rather than cross or cruel,
but just at this period he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was cruel both to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife.
And Madame Melmotte would weep at times and declare that they were
all ruined. Then, at a moment, they burst out into sudden splendour
at Paris. There was an hotel, with carriages and horses almost
unnumbered;--and then there came to their rooms a crowd of dark,
swarthy, greasy men, who were entertained sumptuously; but there were
few women. At this time Marie was hardly nineteen, and young enough
in manner and appearance to be taken for seventeen. Suddenly again
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was to be taken to London, and the migration
had been effected with magnificence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was first taken to Brighton,
where the half of an hotel had been hired, and had then been brought
to Grosvenor Square, and at once thrown into the matrimonial
market. No part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) life had been more disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), more
frightful, than the first months in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been trafficked for
by the Nidderdales and Grassloughs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been too frightened, too
much of a coward to object to anything proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), but still
had been conscious of a desire to have some hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own future
destiny. Luckily for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), the first attempts at trafficking with the
Nidderdales and Grassloughs had come to nothing; and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
was picking up a little courage, and was beginning to feel that it
might be possible to prevent a disposition of herself which did not
suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own tastes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was also beginning to think that there might
be a disposition of herself which would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own tastes.

<p/>Felix Carbury was standing leaning against a wall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was seated
on a chair close to him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I love you better than anyone in the
world,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) said, speaking plainly enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to hear, perhaps
indifferent as to the hearing of others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sir Felix, pray do not talk like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew that before. Now I want you to say whether you will be my
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I answer that myself? Papa settles everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go to papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) replied in a very low whisper. It was thus
that the greatest heiress of the day, the greatest heiress of any day
if people spoke truly, gave herself away to a man without a penny.




<p/>CHAPTER XII.

<p/>SIR FELIX IN HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) MOTHER``S HOUSE.


<p/>When all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) friends were gone Lady Carbury looked about for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
son,--not expecting to find him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew how punctual was his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
nightly attendance at the Beargarden, but still with some faint hope
that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might have remained on this special occasion to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had watched the whispering, had noticed the
cool effrontery with which Felix had spoken,--for without hearing
the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had almost known the very moment in which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
asking,--and had seen the girl's timid face, and eyes turned to the
ground, and the nervous twitching of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) replied. As a
woman, understanding such things, who had herself been wooed, who
had at least dreamed of love, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had greatly disapproved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son's
manner. But yet, if it might be successful, if the girl would put up
with love-making so slight as that, and if the great Melmotte would
accept in return for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) money a title so modest as that of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son,
how glorious should her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son be to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) indifference!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) leave the house before the Melmottes went,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div>said
Henrietta, when the mother spoke of going up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) son's bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might have stayed to-night. Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I say, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought you would have been anxious about your
brother. I feel sure he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did,--and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will be good to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as well as any one else? A girl need not
be odious because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has money. There is nothing disagreeable about
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,--nothing disagreeable. I do not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is especially
attractive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is? I don't see anybody specially attractive. It seems to me you
are quite indifferent about Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not say that, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes you are. You don't understand all that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might be with this
girl's fortune, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) must be unless he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gets money by marriage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is eating us both up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) do that, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well to say that, but I have some heart. I love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
I could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) starve. Think what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might be with #20,000
a-year!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is to marry for that only, I cannot think that they will be
happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better go to bed, Henrietta. You never say a word to comfort
me in all my troubles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Henrietta went to bed, and Lady Carbury absolutely sat up the
whole night waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son, in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might hear his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
tidings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) room, disembarrassed herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
finery, and wrapped herself in a white dressing-gown. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sat
opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) glass, relieving her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) head from its garniture of false
hair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) acknowledged to herself that age was coming on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
could hide the unwelcome approach by art,--hide it more completely
than can most women of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) age; but, there it was, stealing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
with short grey hairs over her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ears and around her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) temples, with
little wrinkles round her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes easily concealed by unobjectionable
cosmetics, and a look of weariness round the mouth which could only
be removed by that self-assertion of herself which practice had
made always possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in company, though it now so frequently
deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was alone.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was not a woman to be unhappy because she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was growing
old. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) happiness, like that of most of us, was ever in the
future,--never reached but always coming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), however, had not
looked for happiness to love and loveliness, and need not therefore
be disappointed on that score. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had never really determined what
it was that might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) happy,--having some hazy aspiration after
social distinction and literary fame, in which was ever commingled
solicitude respecting money. But at the present moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) great
fears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) great hopes were centred on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would not
care how grey might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hair, or how savage might be Mr. Alf, if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) Felix were to marry this heiress. On the other hand, nothing
that pearl-powder or the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>could do would
avail anything, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) could be extricated from the ruin that
now surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) went down into the dining-room, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
might be sure to hear the key in the door, even should she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) sleep, and
waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) with a volume of French memoirs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Unfortunate woman! she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) might have gone to bed and have been duly
called about her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) usual time, for it was past eight and the full
staring daylight shone into her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) room when Felix's cab brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) to
the door. The night had been very wretched to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had slept, and
the fire had sunk nearly to nothing and had refused to become again
comfortable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) book, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
was awake the time seemed to be everlasting. And then it was so
terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) should be gambling at such hours as these!
Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) desire to gamble if this girl's fortune was ready to
fall into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) hands? Fool, to risk his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) health, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) character, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
beauty, the little money which at this moment of time might be
so indispensable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) great project, for the chance of winning
something which in comparison with Marie Melmotte's money must be
despicable! But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) came! She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) waited patiently till he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
had thrown aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) hat and coat, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) appeared at the
dining-room door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had studied her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) part for the occasion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would not say a harsh word, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) endeavoured to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) with
a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you up at this hour!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) face was
flushed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that there was some unsteadiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
gait. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) tipsy, and it would be doubly terrible
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) if such should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) condition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not go to bed till I had seen you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? why should you want to see me? I'll go to bed now. There'll
be plenty of time by-and-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is anything the matter, Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Matter;--what should be the matter? There's been a gentle row among
the fellows at the club;--that's all. I had to tell Grasslough a bit
of my mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) didn't like it. I didn't mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is not going to be any fighting, Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, duelling; oh no,--nothing so exciting as that. Whether
somebody may not have to kick somebody is more than I can say at
present. You must let me go to bed now, for I am about used up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Marie Melmotte say to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing particular.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) hand on the door as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did you say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing particular. Good heavens, mother, do you think that a man is
in a condition to talk about such stuff as that at eight o'clock in
the morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been up all night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew all that I suffer on your behalf you would speak a word
to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>), holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) by the arm, and looking
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) purple face and bloodshot eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) had
been drinking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could smell it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go to the old fellow, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told you to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as I remember, that was about it. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) means to
settle it as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) likes. I should say that it's ten to one against me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Pulling himself away with some little roughness from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) mother's
hold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) way up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) own bedroom, occasionally stumbling
against the stairs.

<p/>Then the heiress herself had accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) son! If so, surely the
thing might be done. Lady Carbury recalled to mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) old conviction
that a daughter may always succeed in beating a hard-hearted parent
in a contention about marriage, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) be well in earnest. But then
the girl must be really in earnest, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) earnestness will depend
on that of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover. In this case, however, there was as yet no
reason for supposing that the great man would object. As far as
outward signs went, the great man had shown some partiality for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
son. No doubt it was Mr. Melmotte who had made Sir Felix a director
of the great American Company. Felix had also been kindly received
in Grosvenor Square. And then Sir Felix was Sir Felix,--a real
baronet. Mr. Melmotte had no doubt endeavoured to catch this and that
lord; but, failing a lord, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) not content himself with a
baronet? Lady Carbury thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son wanted nothing but money
to make him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) an acceptable suitor to such a father-in-law as Mr.
Melmotte;--not money in the funds, not a real fortune, not so many
thousands a-year that could be settled;--the man's own enormous
wealth rendered this unnecessary;--but such a one as Mr. Melmotte
would not like outward palpable signs of immediate poverty. There
should be means enough for present sleekness and present luxury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
must have a horse to ride, and rings and coats to wear, and bright
little canes to carry, and above all the means of making presents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
must not be seen to be poor. Fortunately, most fortunately, Chance
had befriended him (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) lately and had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) some ready money. But if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) went on gambling Chance would certainly take it all away again.
For aught that the poor mother knew, Chance might have done so
already. And then again, it was indispensable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) should abandon
the habit of play--at any rate for the present, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Chance</b></font>) prospects
depended on the good opinions of Mr. Melmotte. Of course such a one
as Mr. Melmotte could not like gambling at a club, however much he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
might approve of it in the City. Why, with such a preceptor to help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), should not Felix learn to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) gambling on the Exchange, or
among the brokers, or in the purlieus of the Bank? Lady Carbury would
at any rate instigate him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to be diligent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) position as director
of the Great Mexican Railway,--which position ought to be the
beginning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) of a fortune to be made on his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) own account. But what
hope could there be for him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) should take to drink? Would not
all hopes be over with Mr. Melmotte should he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ever learn that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
daughter's lover reached home and tumbled up-stairs to bed between
eight and nine o'clock in the morning?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) watched for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) appearance on the following day, and began at
once on the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Felix, I think I shall go down to your cousin Roger for
Whitsuntide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Carbury Manor!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eat some devilled kidneys which
the cook had been specially ordered to get for his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) breakfast. <div class="bookquote">``I
thought you found it so dull that you didn't mean to go there any
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said so, Felix. And now I have a great object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will Hetta do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go too--why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh; I didn't know. I thought that perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mightn't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) shouldn't like it. Besides, everything can't
give way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Roger asked you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d be pleased to have us if I proposed that we
should all go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me, mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you especially.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I know it, mother. What on earth should I do at Carbury
Manor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame Melmotte told me last night that they were all going down to
Caversham to stay three or four days with the Longestaffes. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke
of Lady Pomona as quite her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) particular friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--h! that explains it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Explains what, Felix?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, who had heard of Dolly
Longestaffe, and was not without some fear that this projected visit
to Caversham might have some matrimonial purpose in reference to that
delightful young heir.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say at the club that Melmotte has taken up old Longestaffe's
affairs, and means to put them straight. There's an old property
in Sussex as well as Caversham, and they say that Melmotte is to
have that himself. There's some bother because Dolly, who would do
anything for anybody else, won't join his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father in selling. So the
Melmottes are going to Caversham!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame Melmotte told me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the Longestaffes are the proudest people in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we ought to be at Carbury Manor while they are there. What
can be more natural? Everybody goes out of town at Whitsuntide; and
why shouldn't we run down to the family place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All very natural if you can manage it, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Marie Melmotte goes, I'll be there at any rate for one day and
night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) mother thought that, for him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>), the promise had been graciously
made.




<p/>CHAPTER XIII.

<p/>THE LONGESTAFFES.


<p/>Mr. Adolphus Longestaffe, the squire of Caversham in Suffolk, and of
Pickering Park in Sussex, was closeted on a certain morning for the
best part of an hour with Mr. Melmotte in Abchurch Lane, had there
discussed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) private affairs, and was about to leave the room
with a very dissatisfied air. There are men,--and old men too, who
ought to know the world,--who think that if they can only find the
proper Medea to boil the cauldron for them, they can have their
ruined fortunes so cooked that they shall come out of the pot fresh
and new and unembarrassed. These great conjurors are generally sought
for in the City; and in truth the cauldrons are kept boiling though
the result of the process is seldom absolute rejuvenescence. No
greater Medea than Mr. Melmotte had ever been potent in money
matters, and Mr. Longestaffe had been taught to believe that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
could get the necromancer even to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) affairs everything
would be made right for him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>). But the necromancer had explained to
the squire that property could not be created by the waving of any
wand or the boiling of any cauldron. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), Mr. Melmotte, could put
Mr. Longestaffe in the way of realising property without delay,
of changing it from one shape into another, or could find out the
real market value of the property in question; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could create
nothing. <div class="bookquote">``You have only a life interest, Mr. Longestaffe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; only a life interest. That is customary with family estates in
this country, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so. And therefore you can dispose of nothing else. Your son, of
course, could join you, and then you could sell either one estate or
the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no question of selling Caversham, sir. Lady Pomona and I
reside there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your son will not join you in selling the other place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not directly asked him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) never does do anything that I
wish. I suppose you would not take Pickering Park on a lease for my
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not, Mr. Longestaffe. My wife would not like the
uncertainty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Longestaffe took his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) leave with a feeling of outraged
aristocratic pride. His (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own lawyer would almost have done as much
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) need not have invited his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own lawyer as a guest to
Caversham,--and certainly not his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own lawyer's wife and daughter.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had indeed succeeded in borrowing a few thousand pounds from the
great man at a rate of interest which the great man's head clerk was
to arrange, and this had been effected simply on the security of the
lease of a house in town. There had been an ease in this, an absence
of that delay which generally took place between the expression
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desire for money and the acquisition of it,--and this had
gratified him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was already beginning to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
pay too dearly for that gratification. At the present moment,
too, Mr. Melmotte was odious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) for another reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
condescended to ask Mr. Melmotte to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) a director of the South
Central Pacific and Mexican Railway, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--Adolphus Longestaffe
of Caversham,--had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) request refused! Mr. Longestaffe had
condescended very low. <div class="bookquote">``You have made Lord Alfred Grendall one!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
had said in a complaining tone. Then Mr. Melmotte explained that Lord
Alfred possessed peculiar aptitudes for the position. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I
could do anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe. Upon this
Mr. Melmotte, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) brows and speaking with some roughness,
replied that the number of directors required was completed. Since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had had two duchesses at his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) house Mr. Melmotte was beginning to
feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was entitled to bully any mere commoner, especially a
commoner who could ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) for a seat at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) board.

<p/>Mr. Longestaffe was a tall, heavy man, about fifty, with hair and
whiskers carefully dyed, whose clothes were made with great care,
though they always seemed to fit him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) too tightly, and who thought
very much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) personal appearance. It was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) considered
himself handsome, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was specially proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) aristocratic
bearing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) entertained an idea that all who understood the matter
would perceive at a single glance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was a gentleman of the
first water, and a man of fashion. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was intensely proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
position in life, thinking himself to be immensely superior to all
those who earned their bread. There were no doubt gentlemen of
different degrees, but the English gentleman of gentlemen was he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) who
had land, and family title-deeds, and an old family place, and family
portraits, and family embarrassments, and a family absence of any
useful employment. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was beginning even to look down upon peers,
since so many men of much less consequence than himself had been made
lords; and, having stood and been beaten three or four times for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
county, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was of opinion that a seat in the House was rather a mark
of bad breeding. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a silly man, who had no fixed idea that it
behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to be of use to any one; but, yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had compassed a
certain nobility of feeling. There was very little that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) position
called upon him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to do, but there was much that it forbad him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to do.
It was not allowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to be close in money matters. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could
leave his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tradesmen's bills unpaid till the men were clamorous,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not question the items in their accounts. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could be
tyrannical to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) servants, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not make inquiry as to the
consumption of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wines in the servants' hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no pity for
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tenants in regard to game, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hesitated much as to raising
their rent. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) theory of life and endeavoured to live up to
it; but the attempt had hardly brought satisfaction to himself or to
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) family.

<p/>At the present moment, it was the great desire of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heart to sell
the smaller of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) two properties and disembarrass the other. The
debt had not been altogether of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own making, and the arrangement
would, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) believed, serve his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) whole family as well as himself. It
would also serve his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) son, who was blessed with a third property of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had already managed to burden with debt. The father
could not bear to be refused; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feared that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son would
decline. <div class="bookquote">``But Adolphus wants money as much as any one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>Lady Pomona
had said. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head and pished and pshawed. Women never
could understand anything about money. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked down sadly from
Mr. Melmotte's office and was taken in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brougham to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lawyer's
chambers in Lincoln's Inn. Even for the accommodation of those few
thousand pounds he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was forced to condescend to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lawyers
that the title-deeds of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house in town must be given up. Mr.
Longestaffe felt that the world in general was very hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth are we to do with them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, the eldest Miss
Longestaffe, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think it's a shame of papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana, the second
daughter. <div class="bookquote">``I certainly shan't trouble myself to entertain them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will leave them all on my hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona
wearily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's the use of having them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>urged Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I can understand
going to a crush at their house in town when everybody else goes. One
doesn't speak to them, and need not know them afterwards. As to the
girl, I'm sure I shouldn't remember her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) if I were to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a fine thing if Adolphus would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Pomona.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly will never marry anybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana. <div class="bookquote">``The idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolphus</b></font>)
taking the trouble of asking a girl to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolphus</b></font>)! Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolphus</b></font>) won't
come down to Caversham; cart-ropes wouldn't bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolphus</b></font>). If that is to
be the game, mamma, it is quite hopeless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should Dolly marry such a creature as that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>asked Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because everybody wants money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't
know what your papa is to do, or how it is that there never is any
money for anything. I don't spend it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that we do anything out of the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``I
haven't the slightest idea what papa's income is; but if we're to
live at all, I don't know how we are to make a change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's always been like this ever since I can remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said
Georgiana, <div class="bookquote">``and I don't mean to worry about it any more. I suppose
it's just the same with other people, only one doesn't know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dears--when we are obliged to have such people as these
Melmottes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As for that, if we didn't have them somebody else would. I shan't
trouble myself about them. I suppose it will only be for two days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, they're coming for a week!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then papa must take them about the country, that's all. I never did
hear of anything so absurd. What good can they do papa by being down
there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is wonderfully rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll give papa his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>continued Georgiana.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't pretend to understand, but I think there is more
fuss about these things than they deserve. If papa hasn't got money
to live at home, why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) go abroad for a year? The Sydney
Beauchamps did that, and the girls had quite a nice time of it in
Florence. It was there that Clara Beauchamp met young Lord Liffey.
I shouldn't at all mind that kind of thing, but I think it quite
horrible to have these sort of people brought down upon us at
Caversham. No one knows who they are, or where they came from, or
what they'll turn to.''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>So spoke Georgiana, who among the Longestaffes
was supposed to have the strongest head, and certainly the sharpest
tongue.

<p/>This conversation took place in the drawing-room of the Longestaffes'
family town-house in Bruton Street. It was not by any means a
charming house, having but few of those luxuries and elegancies which
have been added of late years to newly-built London residences. It
was gloomy and inconvenient, with large drawing-rooms, bad bedrooms,
and very little accommodation for servants. But it was the old family
town-house, having been inhabited by three or four generations of
Longestaffes, and did not savour of that radical newness which
prevails, and which was peculiarly distasteful to Mr. Longestaffe.
Queen's Gate and the quarters around were, according to Mr.
Longestaffe, devoted to opulent tradesmen. Even Belgrave Square,
though its aristocratic properties must be admitted, still smelt
of the mortar. Many of those living there and thereabouts had
never possessed in their families real family town-houses. The old
streets lying between Piccadilly and Oxford Street, with one or two
well-known localities to the south and north of these boundaries,
were the proper sites for these habitations. When Lady Pomona,
instigated by some friend of high rank but questionable taste, had
once suggested a change to Eaton Square, Mr. Longestaffe had at once
snubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) wife. If Bruton Street wasn't good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and the
girls then they might remain at Caversham. The threat of remaining at
Caversham had been often made, for Mr. Longestaffe, proud as he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) town-house, was, from year to year, very anxious to save the
expense of the annual migration. The girls' dresses and the girls'
horses, his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) wife's carriage and his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own brougham, his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) dull London
dinner-parties, and the one ball which it was always necessary that
Lady Pomona should give, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) look forward to the end of July,
with more dread than to any other period. It was then that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) began
to know what that year's season would cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had never yet
been able to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) family in the country during the entire year.
The girls, who as yet knew nothing of the Continent beyond Paris, had
signified their willingness to be taken about Germany and Italy for
twelve months, but had shown by every means in their power that they
would mutiny against any intention on their father's part to keep
them at Caversham during the London season.

<p/>Georgiana had just finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) strong-minded protest against the
Melmottes, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) brother strolled into the room. Dolly did not
often show himself in Bruton Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had rooms of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own,
and could seldom even be induced to dine with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) family. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
mother wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) notes without end,--notes every day, pressing
invitations of all sorts upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) come and dine; would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
take them to the theatre; would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) go to this ball; would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) go to
that evening-party? These Dolly barely read, and never answered. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would open them, thrust them into some pocket, and then forget them.
Consequently his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); and even his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters, who
were at any rate superior to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in intellect, treated him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with a
certain deference. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could do as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) liked, and they felt themselves
to be slaves, bound down by the dulness of the Longestaffe regime.
His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) freedom was grand to their eyes, and very enviable, although they
were aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had already so used it as to impoverish himself in
the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wealth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Adolphus,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, <div class="bookquote">``this is so nice of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is rather nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, submitting himself to be
kissed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh Dolly, whoever would have thought of seeing you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Beauchamp</b></font>) some tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother. Lady Pomona was always having
tea from four o'clock till she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was taken away to dress for dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner have soda and brandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't ask for it, and I don't expect to get it; indeed I don't
want it. I only said I'd sooner have it than tea. Where's the
governor?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They all looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with wondering eyes. There must be
something going on more than they had dreamed of, when Dolly asked to
see his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa went out in the brougham immediately after lunch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia
gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll wait a little for him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do stay and dine with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not do that, because I've got to go and dine with some
fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some fellow! I believe you don't know where you're going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said
Georgiana.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My fellow knows. At least he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a fool if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Adolphus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>began Lady Pomona very seriously, <div class="bookquote">``I've got a plan and
I want you to help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope there isn't very much to do in it, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're all going to Caversham, just for Whitsuntide, and we
particularly want you to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By George! no; I couldn't do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't heard half. Madame Melmotte and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter are
coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The d-- they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``do remember where you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I will;--and I'll remember too where I won't be. I won't go to
Caversham to meet old mother Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>continued the mother, <div class="bookquote">``do you know that Miss Melmotte
will have twenty--thousand--a year the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) marries; and that
in all probability her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) husband will some day be the richest man in
Europe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half the fellows in London are after her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't you be one of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) isn't going to stay in the same house with half the fellows in
London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>suggested Georgiana. <div class="bookquote">``If you've a mind to try it you'll have
a chance which nobody else can have just at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I haven't any mind to try it. Good gracious me;--oh dear! it
isn't at all in my way, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>) wouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would put everything so straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll have to remain crooked if nothing else will put them
straight. There's the governor. I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) voice. Now for a row.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Longestaffe entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona, <div class="bookquote">``here's Adolphus come to see us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>The
father nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son but said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``We want him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolphus</b></font>) to
stay and dine, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolphus</b></font>)'s engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolphus</b></font>) doesn't know where,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My fellow knows;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolphus</b></font>) keeps a book. I've got a letter, sir, ever so
long, from those fellows in Lincoln's Inn. They want me to come and
see you about selling something; so I've come. It's an awful bore,
because I don't understand anything about it. Perhaps there isn't
anything to be sold. If so I can go away again, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better come with me into the study,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father. <div class="bookquote">``We
needn't disturb your mother and sisters about business.''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>Then the
squire led the way out of the room, and Dolly followed, making a
woful grimace at his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) sisters. The three ladies sat over their tea
for about half-an-hour, waiting,--not the result of the conference,
for with that they did not suppose that they would be made
acquainted,--but whatever signs of good or evil might be collected
from the manner and appearance of the squire when he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) should return to
them. Dolly they did not expect to see again,--probably for a month.
He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) and the squire never did come together without quarrelling, and
careless as was the young man in every other respect, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hitherto
been obdurate as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own rights in any dealings which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father. At the end of the half hour Mr. Longestaffe returned to
the drawing-room, and at once pronounced the doom of the family. <div class="bookquote">``My
dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we shall not return from Caversham to London this
year.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) struggled hard to maintain a grand dignified tranquillity
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) spoke, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) voice quivered with emotion.

become of us? If he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) wants to save money why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) shut Caversham
up altogether and go abroad? Caversham costs a great deal more than
is spent in London, and it's the dullest house, I think, in all
England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/>The family party in Bruton Street that evening was not very gay.
Nothing was being done, and they sat gloomily in each other's
company. Whatever mutinous resolutions might be formed and carried
out by the ladies of the family, they were not brought forward on
that occasion. The two girls were quite silent, and would not speak
to their father, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) addressed them they answered simply by
monosyllables. Lady Pomona was ill, and sat in a corner of a sofa,
wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) eyes. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) had been imparted up-stairs the purport of
the conversation between Dolly and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father. Dolly had refused to
consent to the sale of Pickering unless half the produce of the sale
were to be given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) at once. When it had been explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>)
that the sale would be desirable in order that the Caversham property
might be freed from debt, which Caversham property would eventually
be his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) also had an estate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) own which was a
little mortgaged and would be the better for money. The result seemed
to be that Pickering could not be sold,--and, as a consequence of
that, Mr. Longestaffe had determined that there should be no more
London expenses that year.

<p/>The girls, when they got up to go to bed, bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) and kissed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) head, as was their custom. There was very little show of
affection in the kiss. <div class="bookquote">``You had better remember that what you have
to do in town must be done this week,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) said. They heard the words,
but marched in stately silence out of the room without deigning to
notice them.




<p/>CHAPTER XIV.

<p/>CARBURY MANOR.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it quite nice, mamma; that's all. Of course if you
have made up your mind to go, I must go with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth can be more natural than that you should go to your
own cousin's house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what I mean, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's done now, my dear, and I don't think there is anything at all
in what you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>This little conversation arose from Lady Carbury's announcement
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) intention of soliciting the hospitality of
Carbury Manor for the Whitsun week. It was very grievous to Henrietta
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) should be taken to the house of a man who was in love with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), even though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had no escape. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could
not remain in town by herself, nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) even allude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
grievance to anyone but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother. Lady Carbury, in order that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might be quite safe from opposition, had posted the following
letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin before she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter:--


<p/>Welbeck Street,
24th April, 18--.

<p/>MY DEAR ROGER,

<p/>We know how kind you are and how sincere, and that if what
I am going to propose doesn't suit you'll say so at once.
I have been working very hard,--too hard indeed, and I
feel that nothing will do me so much real good as getting
into the country for a day or two. Would you take us for a
part of Whitsun week? We would come down on the 20th May
and stay over the Sunday if you would keep us. Felix says
he (<font color='blue'><b>ROGER</b></font>) would run down though he (<font color='blue'><b>ROGER</b></font>) would not trouble you for so
long a time as we talk of staying.

<p/>I'm sure you must have been glad to hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>ROGER</b></font>) being put
upon that Great American Railway Board as a Director. It
opens a new sphere of life to him (<font color='blue'><b>ROGER</b></font>), and will enable him (<font color='blue'><b>ROGER</b></font>) to
prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>ROGER</b></font>) can make himself useful. I think it was a
great confidence to place in one so young.

<p/>Of course you will say so at once if my little proposal
interferes with any of your plans, but you have been so
very very kind to us that I have no scruple in making it.

<p/>Henrietta joins with me in kind love.

<p/>Your affectionate cousin,

<p/>MATILDA CARBURY.


<p/>There was much in this letter that disturbed and even annoyed Roger
Carbury. In the first place he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) felt that Henrietta should not be
brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) house. Much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), dear as her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) presence
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) always was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hardly wished to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) at Carbury unless
she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would come with a resolution to be its future mistress. In one
respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did Lady Carbury an injustice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was
anxious to forward his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) suit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought that Henrietta was being
brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) house with that object. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not heard that the
great heiress was coming into his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) neighbourhood, and therefore knew
nothing of Lady Carbury's scheme in that direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was, too,
disgusted by the ill-founded pride which the mother expressed at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
son's position as a director. Roger Carbury did not believe in the
Railway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not believe in Fisker, nor in Melmotte, and certainly
not in the Board generally. Paul Montague had acted in opposition to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) advice in yielding to the seductions of Fisker. The whole thing
was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) mind false, fraudulent, and ruinous. Of what nature could
be a Company which should have itself directed by such men as Lord
Alfred Grendall and Sir Felix Carbury? And then as to their great
Chairman, did not everybody know, in spite of all the duchesses, that
Mr. Melmotte was a gigantic swindler? Although there was more than
one immediate cause for bitterness between them, Roger loved Paul
Montague well and could not bear with patience the appearance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friend's name on such a list. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was asked for warm
congratulations because Sir Felix Carbury was one of the Board! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
did not know which to despise most, Sir Felix for belonging to such a
Board, or the Board for having such a director. <div class="bookquote">``New sphere of life!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) said to himself. <div class="bookquote">``The only proper sphere for them all would be
Newgate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And there was another trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) had asked Paul Montague to come to
Carbury for this special week, and Paul had accepted the invitation.
With the constancy, which was perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) strongest characteristic,
he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) old affection for the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) could not bear the idea
of a permanent quarrel, though he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) knew that there must be a quarrel
if the man interfered with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dearest hopes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down
to Carbury intending that the name of Henrietta Carbury should not
be mentioned between them;--and now it was proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that
Henrietta Carbury should be at the Manor House at the very time of
Paul's visit! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must tell Paul not
to come.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two letters at once. That to Lady Carbury was very
short. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be delighted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and Henrietta at the time
named,--and would be very glad should it suit Felix to come also.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not say a word about the Board, or the young man's probable
usefulness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new sphere of life. To Montague his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter was
longer. <div class="bookquote">``It is always best to be open and true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Since you
were kind enough to say that you would come to me, Lady Carbury has
proposed to visit me just at the same time and to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter.
After what has passed between us I need hardly say that I could not
make you both welcome here together. It is not pleasant to me to have
to ask you to postpone your visit, but I think you will not accuse me
of a want of hospitality towards you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul wrote back to say that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sure that there was no want of hospitality, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
remain in town.

<p/>Suffolk is not especially a picturesque county, nor can it be said
that the scenery round Carbury was either grand or beautiful; but
there were little prettinesses attached to the house itself and the
grounds around it which gave it a charm of its own. The Carbury
River,--so called, though at no place is it so wide but that an
active schoolboy might jump across it,--runs, or rather creeps into
the Waveney, and in its course is robbed by a moat which surrounds
Carbury Manor House. The moat has been rather a trouble to the
proprietors, and especially so to Roger, as in these days of sanitary
considerations it has been felt necessary either to keep it clean
with at any rate moving water in it, or else to fill it up and
abolish it altogether. That plan of abolishing it had to be thought
of and was seriously discussed about ten years since; but then it was
decided that such a proceeding would altogether alter the character
of the house, would destroy the gardens, and would create a waste of
mud all round the place which it would take years to beautify, or
even to make endurable. And then an important question had been asked
by an intelligent farmer who had long been a tenant on the property;
<div class="bookquote">``Fill un oop;--eh, eh; sooner said than doone, squoire. Where be the
stoof to come from?''  (<font color='red'><b>a tenant</b></font>)</div>The squire, therefore, had given up that idea,
and instead of abolishing his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) moat had made it prettier than ever.
The high road from Bungay to Beccles ran close to the house,--so
close that the gable ends of the building were separated from it
only by the breadth of the moat. A short, private road, not above
a hundred yards in length, led to the bridge which faced the front
door. The bridge was old, and high, with sundry architectural
pretensions, and guarded by iron gates in the centre, which, however,
were very rarely closed. Between the bridge and the front door there
was a sweep of ground just sufficient for the turning of a carriage,
and on either side of this the house was brought close to the water,
so that the entrance was in a recess, or irregular quadrangle, of
which the bridge and moat formed one side. At the back of the house
there were large gardens screened from the road by a wall ten feet
high, in which there were yew trees and cypresses said to be of
wonderful antiquity. The gardens were partly inside the moat, but
chiefly beyond them, and were joined by two bridges--a foot bridge
and one with a carriage way,--and there was another bridge at the end
of the house furthest from the road, leading from the back door to
the stables and farmyard.

<p/>The house itself had been built in the time of Charles II., when
that which we call Tudor architecture was giving way to a cheaper,
less picturesque, though perhaps more useful form. But Carbury Manor
House, through the whole county, had the reputation of being a Tudor
building. The windows were long, and for the most part low, made with
strong mullions, and still contained small, old-fashioned panes; for
the squire had not as yet gone to the expense of plate glass. There
was one high bow window, which belonged to the library, and which
looked out on to the gravel sweep, at the left of the front door as
you entered it. All the other chief rooms faced upon the garden. The
house itself was built of a stone that had become buff, or almost
yellow with years, and was very pretty. It was still covered with
tiles, as were all the attached buildings. It was only two stories
high, except at the end, where the kitchens were placed and the
offices, which thus rose above the other part of the edifice. The
rooms throughout were low, and for the most part long and narrow,
with large wide fire-places and deep wainscotings. Taking it
altogether, one would be inclined to say, that it was picturesque
rather than comfortable. Such as it was its owner was very proud
of it,--with a pride of which he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) never spoke to anyone, which he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
endeavoured studiously to conceal, but which had made itself known
to all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) well. The houses of the gentry around him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) were
superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) in material comfort and general accommodation, but to
none of them belonged that thoroughly established look of old county
position which belonged to Carbury. Bundlesham, where the Primeros
lived, was the finest house in that part of the county, but it
looked as if it had been built within the last twenty years. It
was surrounded by new shrubs and new lawns, by new walls and new
outhouses, and savoured of trade;--so at least thought Roger Carbury,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) never said the words. Caversham was a very large mansion,
built in the early part of George III.``s reign, when men did care
that things about them should be comfortable, but did not care that
they should be picturesque. There was nothing at all to recommend
Caversham but its size. Eardly Park, the seat of the Hepworths, had,
as a park, some pretensions. Carbury possessed nothing that could be
called a park, the enclosures beyond the gardens being merely so many
home paddocks. But the house of Eardly was ugly and bad. The Bishop's
palace was an excellent gentleman's residence, but then that too was
comparatively modern, and had no peculiar features of its own. Now
Carbury Manor House was peculiar, and in the eyes of its owner was
pre-eminently beautiful.

<p/>It often troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to think what would come of the place when
he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was at present forty years old, and was perhaps as
healthy a man as you could find in the whole county. Those around
who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew into manhood among them, especially the
farmers of the neighbourhood, still regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a young man. They
spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the country fairs as the young squire. When in his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)
happiest moods he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) could be almost a boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) still had something
of old-fashioned boyish reverence for his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) elders. But of late there
had grown up a great care within his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) breast,--a care which does not
often, perhaps, in these days bear so heavily on men's hearts as it
used to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had asked his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) cousin to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>),--having assured
himself with certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) did love her (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) better than any other
woman,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had declined. She (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had refused him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) more than once,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) implicitly when she (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) could
not love him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had a way of believing people, especially when
such belief was opposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own interests, and had none of that
self-confidence which makes a man think that if opportunity be
allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can win a woman even in spite of herself. But if it
were fated that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not succeed with Henrietta, then,--so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
felt assured,--no marriage would now be possible to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). In that case
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must look out for an heir, and could regard himself simply as a
stop-gap among the Carburys. In that case he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could never enjoy the
luxury of doing the best he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could with the property in order that a
son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own might enjoy it.

<p/>Now Sir Felix was the next heir. Roger was hampered by no entail,
and could leave every acre of the property as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pleased. In one
respect the natural succession to it by Sir Felix would generally be
considered fortunate. It had happened that a title had been won in a
lower branch of the family, and were this succession to take place
the family title and the family property would go together. No doubt
to Sir Felix himself such an arrangement would seem to be the most
proper thing in the world,--as it would also to Lady Carbury were it
not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) looked to Carbury Manor as the future home of another
child. But to all this the present owner of the property had very
strong objections. It was not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) thought ill of the baronet
himself,--so ill as to feel thoroughly convinced that no good
could come from that quarter,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) thought ill also of the
baronetcy itself. Sir Patrick, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) thinking, had been altogether
unjustifiable in accepting an enduring title, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) would
leave behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Patrick</b></font>) no property adequate for its support. A baronet, so
thought Roger Carbury, should be a rich man, rich enough to grace the
rank which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) assumed to wear. A title, according to Roger's doctrine
on such subjects, could make no man a gentleman, but, if improperly
worn, might degrade a man who would otherwise be a gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
thought that a gentleman, born and bred, acknowledged as such without
doubt, could not be made more than a gentleman by all the titles
which the Queen could give. With these old-fashioned notions Roger
hated the title which had fallen upon a branch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
certainly would not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) property to support the title which Sir
Felix unfortunately possessed. But Sir Felix was the natural heir,
and this man felt himself constrained, almost as by some divine law,
to see that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) land went by natural descent. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in no
degree fettered as to its disposition, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not presume himself to
have more than a life interest in the estate. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty to see
that it went from Carbury to Carbury as long as there was a Carbury
to hold it, and especially his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty to see that it should go from
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death, unimpaired in extent or value. There was
no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should himself die for the next twenty or thirty
years,--but were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to die Sir Felix would undoubtedly dissipate the
acres, and then there would be an end of Carbury. But in such case
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Roger Carbury, would at any rate have done his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) duty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that
no human arrangements can be fixed, let the care in making them be
ever so great. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thinking it would be better that the estate
should be dissipated by a Carbury than held together by a stranger.
He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would stick to the old name while there was one to bear it, and
to the old family while a member of it was left. So thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had
already made his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) will, leaving the entire property to the man whom of
all others he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most despised, should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself die without child.

<p/>In the afternoon of the day on which Lady Carbury was expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wandered about the place thinking of all this. How infinitely better
it would be that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have an heir of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. How wonderfully
beautiful would the world be to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if at last his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin would
consent to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife! How wearily insipid must it be if no such
consent could be obtained from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought much of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
welfare too. In very truth he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not like Lady Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) character, judging her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) with almost absolute accuracy. The
woman was affectionate, seeking good things for others rather than
for herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was essentially worldly, believing that good
could come out of evil, that falsehood might in certain conditions be
better than truth, that shams and pretences might do the work of true
service, that a strong house might be built upon the sand! It was
lamentable to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved should be subjected to this
teaching, and live in an atmosphere so burdened with falsehood. Would
not the touch of pitch at last defile her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart of hearts he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loved Paul Montague; and of Paul himself he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
beginning to fear evil. What but a sham could be a man who consented
to pretend to sit as one of a Board of Directors to manage an
enormous enterprise with such colleagues as Lord Alfred Grendall and
Sir Felix Carbury, under the absolute control of such a one as Mr.
Augustus Melmotte? Was not this building a house upon the sand with
a vengeance? What a life it would be for Henrietta Carbury were she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
to marry a man striving to become rich without labour and without
capital, and who might one day be wealthy and the next a beggar,--a
city adventurer, who of all men was to him (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) the vilest and most
dishonest? He (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) strove to think well of Paul Montague, but such was the
life which he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) feared the young man was preparing for himself.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into the house and wandered up through the rooms which
the two ladies were to occupy. As their host, a host without a
wife or mother or sister, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty to see that things were
comfortable, but it may be doubted whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been so
careful had the mother been coming alone. In the smaller room of the
two the hangings were all white, and the room was sweet with May
flowers; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought a white rose from the hot-house, and placed
it in a glass on the dressing table. Surely she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would know who put it
there.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood at the open window, looking down upon the lawn, gazing
vacantly for half an hour, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the wheels of the carriage
before the front door. During that half hour he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would try again as though there had as yet been no repulse.




<p/>CHAPTER XV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THAT I AM HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) MOTHER.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is so kind of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin's
hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) got out of the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The kindness is on your part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt so much before I dared to ask you to take us. But I did so
long to get into the country, and I do so love Carbury. And--and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where should a Carbury go to escape from London smoke, but to the
old house? I am afraid Henrietta will find it dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to remember that I am never
dull in the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The bishop and Mrs. Yeld are coming here to dine to-morrow,--and the
Hepworths.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be so glad to meet the bishop once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think everybody must be glad to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) is such a dear, good
fellow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife is just as good. And there is another gentleman
coming whom you have never seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A new neighbour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--a new neighbour;--Father John Barham, who has come to Beccles
as priest. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) has got a little cottage about a mile from here, in
this parish, and does duty both at Beccles and Bungay. I used to know
something of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is a gentleman then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is a gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) degree at Oxford, and
then became what we call a pervert, and what I suppose they call a
convert. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) has not got a shilling in the world beyond what they
pay him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) as a priest, which I take it amounts to about as much as
the wages of a day labourer. He (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) told me the other day that he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) was
absolutely forced to buy second-hand clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How shocking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) didn't seem to be at all shocked at telling it. We have got to be
quite friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will the bishop like to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should not the bishop like to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)? I've told the bishop all
about him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), and the bishop particularly wishes to know him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) won't
hurt the bishop. But you and Hetta will find it very dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't find it dull, Mr. Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div>said Henrietta.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was to escape from the eternal parties that we came down here,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had nevertheless been anxious to hear what
guests were expected at the Manor House. Sir Felix had promised to
come down on Saturday, with the intention of returning on Monday, and
Lady Carbury had hoped that some visiting might be arranged between
Caversham and the Manor House, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son might have the full
advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) closeness to Marie Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have asked the Longestaffes for Monday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are down here then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they arrived yesterday. There is always a flustering breeze
in the air and a perturbation generally through the county when they
come or go, and I think I perceived the effects about four in the
afternoon. They won't come, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They never do. They have probably a house full of guests, and they
know that my accommodation is limited. I've no doubt they'll ask us
on Tuesday or Wednesday, and if you like we will go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know they are to have guests,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What guests?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Melmottes are coming to them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) made the
announcement, felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) voice and countenance and self-possession
were failing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not mention the thing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
would any matter that was indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Melmottes coming to Caversham!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, looking at
Henrietta, who blushed with shame as she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had been
brought into her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) lover's house solely in order that her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) brother might
have an opportunity of seeing Marie Melmotte in the country.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,--Madame Melmotte told me. I take it they are very intimate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Longestaffe ask the Melmottes to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) at Caversham!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should almost as soon have believed that I myself might have been
induced to ask them here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy, Roger, that Mr. Longestaffe does want a little pecuniary
assistance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) condescends to get it in this way! I suppose it will make no
difference soon whom one knows, and whom one doesn't. Things aren't
as they were, of course, and never will be again. Perhaps it's all
for the better;--I won't say it isn't. But I should have thought that
such a man as Mr. Longestaffe might have kept such another man as Mr.
Melmotte out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife's drawing-room.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div>Henrietta became redder
than ever. Even Lady Carbury flushed up, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) remembered that Roger
Carbury knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter to Madame Melmotte's
ball. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought of this himself as soon as the words were spoken,
and then tried to make some half apology. <div class="bookquote">``I don't approve of them
in London, you know; but I think they are very much worse in the
country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there was a movement. The ladies were shown into their rooms,
and Roger again went out into the garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) began to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
understood it all. Lady Carbury had come down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) house in order
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might be near the Melmottes! There was something in this
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt it difficult not to resent. It was for no love of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had felt that Henrietta ought not to have been
brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) house; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could have forgiven that, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
presence there was a charm to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could have forgiven that, even
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was thinking that her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) there with
the object of disposing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>). If it were so, the mother's object
would be the same as his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own, and such a manoeuvre he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could pardon,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not approve. His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) self-love had to some extent been
gratified. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) house had been simply used
in order that a vile project of marrying two vile people to each
other might be furthered!

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was thinking of all this, Lady Carbury came out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in
the garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) travelling dress, and made herself
pretty, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) well knew how to do. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) face in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sweetest smiles. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind, also, was full of the Melmottes, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wished to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) stern, unbending cousin all the good
that might come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and hers by an alliance with the heiress. <div class="bookquote">``I
can understand, Roger,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``that you should
not like those people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Melmottes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't dislike them. How should I dislike people that I never saw?
I dislike those who seek their society simply because they have the
reputation of being rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meaning me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not meaning you. I don't dislike you, as you know very well,
though I do dislike the fact that you should run after these people.
I was thinking of the Longestaffes then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose, my friend, that I run after them for my own
gratification? Do you think that I go to their house because I find
pleasure in their magnificence; or that I follow them down here for
any good that they will do me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not follow them at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go back if you bid me, but I must first explain what I mean.
You know my son's condition,--better, I fear, than he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) does himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger nodded assent to this, but said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``What is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to do? The
only chance for a young man in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) position is that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should marry a
girl with money. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is good-looking; you can't deny that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nature has done enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must take him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was put into the army very young, and
was very young when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) came into possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own small fortune.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might have done better; but how many young men placed in such
temptations do well? As it is, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has nothing left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore is it not imperative that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should marry a girl with
money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call that stealing a girl's money, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Roger, how hard you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man must be hard or soft,--which is best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With women I think that a little softness has the most effect. I
want to make you understand this about the Melmottes. It stands to
reason that the girl will not marry Felix unless she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not? Is a girl to be debarred from being loved because
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has money? Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks to be married, and why should she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
not have Felix if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) likes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best? Cannot you sympathize with my
anxiety so to place him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall not be a disgrace to the name
and to the family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better not talk about the family, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I think so much about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will never get me to say that I think the family will be
benefited by a marriage with the daughter of Mr. Melmotte. I look
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as dirt in the gutter. To me, in my old-fashioned way, all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) money, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has it, can make no difference. When there is a
question of marriage people at any rate should know something of each
other. Who knows anything of this man? Who can be sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fortune when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it all comes to that. Men say openly that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an adventurer
and a swindler. No one pretends to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a gentleman.
There is a consciousness among all who speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) amasses
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money not by honest trade, but by unknown tricks,--as does a card
sharper. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is one whom we would not admit into our kitchens, much
less to our tables, on the score of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own merits. But because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has learned the art of making money, we not only put up with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but
settle upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carcase as so many birds of prey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that Felix should not marry the girl, even if they love
each other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head in disgust, feeling sure that any idea of love on
the part of the young man was a sham and a pretence, not only as
regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but also his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not quite declare this,
and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought so.
<div class="bookquote">``I have nothing more to say about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``Had it gone on
in London I should have said nothing. It is no affair of mine. When
I am told that the girl is in the neighbourhood, at such a house as
Caversham, and that Felix is coming here in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be near
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prey, and when I am asked to be a party to the thing, I can
only say what I think. Your son would be welcome to my house, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is your son and my cousin, little as I approve his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mode of life;
but I could have wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had chosen some other place for the
work that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has on hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you wish it, Roger, we will return to London. I shall find it
hard to explain to Hetta;--but we will go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I certainly do not wish that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have said such hard things! How are we to stay? You speak
of Felix as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) were all bad.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoping to get
from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) some contradiction of this, some retractation, some kindly
word; but it was what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did think, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nothing to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
could bear much. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not delicate as to censure implied, or even
expressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had endured rough usage before, and was prepared to
endure more. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found fault with herself, or with Henrietta, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
would have put up with it, for the sake of benefits to come,--would
have forgiven it the more easily because perhaps it might not have
been deserved. But for her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) son she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was prepared to fight. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) did
not defend him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), who would? <div class="bookquote">``I am grieved, Roger, that we should have
troubled you with our visit, but I think that we had better go. You
are very harsh, and it crushes me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not meant to be harsh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say that Felix is seeking for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)--prey, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is to be

At any rate, you should remember that I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mother.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) sense of injury very well. Roger began to be
ashamed of himself, and to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had spoken unkind words. And
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not know how to recall them. <div class="bookquote">``If I have hurt you, I regret
it much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you have hurt me. I think I will go in now. How very hard

till they had reached the door leading from the garden into the
house, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If I have been over hot with you,
let me beg your pardon.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) smiled and bowed; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) smile was not
one of forgiveness; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) essayed to pass on into the house.
<div class="bookquote">``Pray do not speak of going, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I will go to my room now. My head aches so that I can hardly
stand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was late in the afternoon,--about six,--and according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) daily
custom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should have gone round to the offices to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) men as
they came from their work, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) stood still for a few moments on
the spot where Lady Carbury had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and went slowly across the
lawn to the bridge and there seated himself on the parapet. Could it
really be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) meant to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) house in anger and to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
daughter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)? Was it thus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was to part with the one human
being in the world that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) loved? He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was a man who thought much of
the duties of hospitality, feeling that a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own house was
bound to exercise a courtesy towards his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guests sweeter, softer, more
gracious than the world required elsewhere. And of all guests those
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own name were the best entitled to such courtesy at Carbury.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held the place in trust for the use of others. But if there were
one among all others to whom the house should be a house of refuge
from care, not an abode of trouble, on whose behalf were it possible
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make the very air softer, and the flowers sweeter than their
wont, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would declare, were such words possible to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
tongue, that of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, and of all things there she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
the mistress, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would condescend to love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or no,--that
one was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin Hetta. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been told by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guest that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been so rough to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter must return to
London!

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not acquit himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been rough.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said very hard words. It was true that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not have
expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meaning without hard words, nor have repressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
meaning without self-reproach. But in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present mood he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not
comfort himself by justifying himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought
to have remembered that Felix was her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) son; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had
acted well the part of an outraged mother. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart was so soft that
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the woman to be false and the son to be worthless, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
utterly condemned himself. Look where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would there was no comfort.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sat half-an-hour upon the bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned towards the
house to dress for dinner,--and to prepare himself for an apology, if
any apology might be accepted. At the door, standing in the doorway
as though waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin Hetta. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
bosom the rose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had placed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thought that there was more in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes of graciousness towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever seen there before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``mamma is so unhappy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear that I have offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that, but that you should be so,--so angry about Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am vexed with myself that I have vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>),--more vexed than I can
tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) knows how good you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not. I was very bad just now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was so offended with me
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) talked of going back to London.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to speak,
but Hetta had no words ready for the moment. <div class="bookquote">``I should be wretched
indeed if you and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) were to leave my house in anger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) will do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not angry. I should never dare to be angry with you. I only
wish that Felix would be better. They say that young men have to be
bad, and that they do get to be better as they grow older. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is
something in the city now, a director they call him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and mamma thinks
that the work will be of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger could express no
hope in this direction or even look as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) approved of the
directorship. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should not try at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Hetta, I only wish he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Girls are so different, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not till late in the evening, long after dinner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) apology in form to Lady Carbury; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did make it, and at last
it was accepted. <div class="bookquote">``I think I was rough to you, talking about Felix,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``and I beg your pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were energetic, that was all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman should never be rough to a lady, and a man should never
be rough to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own guests. I hope you will forgive me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) answered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) by putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand and smiling on him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); and so the quarrel
was over.

<p/>Lady Carbury understood the full extent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) triumph, and was
enabled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) disposition to use it thoroughly. Felix might now
come down to Carbury, and go over from thence to Caversham, and
prosecute his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wooing, and the master of Carbury could make no further
objection. And Felix, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would come, would not now be snubbed.
Roger would understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was constrained to courtesy by the
former severity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) language. Such points as these Lady Carbury
never missed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) understood it too, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was soft and
gracious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) bearing, endeavouring to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) house as pleasant
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) two guests, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been cheated out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) undoubted right to disapprove of all connection with the
Melmottes. In the course of the evening there came a note,--or rather
a bundle of notes,--from Caversham. That addressed to Roger was
in the form of a letter. Lady Pomona was sorry to say that the
Longestaffe party were prevented from having the pleasure of dining
at Carbury Hall by the fact that they had a house full of guests.
Lady Pomona hoped that Mr. Carbury and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) relatives, who, Lady
Pomona heard, were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at the Hall, would do the Longestaffes
the pleasure of dining at Caversham either on the Monday or Tuesday
following, as might best suit the Carbury plans. That was the purport
of Lady Pomona's letter to Roger Carbury. Then there were cards of
invitation for Lady Carbury and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter, and also for Sir Felix.

<p/>Roger, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own note, handed the others over to Lady
Carbury, and then asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would wish to have done. The
tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke, grated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ear, as there was
something in it of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) former harshness. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew how to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
triumph. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly shall not go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``but there will be no
difficulty whatever in sending you over. You must answer at once,
because their servant is waiting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monday will be best,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">''--that is, if nobody is coming
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be nobody here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I had better say that I, and Hetta,--and Felix will accept
their invitation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can make no suggestion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, thinking how delightful it
would be if Henrietta could remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); how objectionable it was
that Henrietta should be taken to Caversham to meet the Melmottes.
Poor Hetta herself could say nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) certainly did not wish to
meet the Melmottes, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) wish to dine, alone, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin
Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury after a moment's thought. <div class="bookquote">``It
is very good of you to let us go, and to send us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you will do here just as you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) replied. But
there was still that tone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) voice which Lady Carbury feared. A
quarter of an hour later the Caversham servant was on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) way home
with two letters,--the one from Roger expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
could not accept Lady Pomona's invitation, and the other from Lady
Carbury declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son and daughter would have great
pleasure in dining at Caversham on the Monday.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI.

<p/>THE BISHOP AND THE PRIEST.


<p/>The afternoon on which Lady Carbury arrived at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin's house had
been very stormy. Roger Carbury had been severe, and Lady Carbury
had suffered under his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) severity,--or had at least so well pretended
to suffer as to leave on Roger's mind a strong impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
had been cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had then talked of going back at once to
London, and when consenting to remain, had remained with a very bad
feminine headache. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had altogether carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) point, but had
done so in a storm. The next morning was very calm. That question of
meeting the Melmottes had been settled, and there was no need for
speaking of them again. Roger went out by himself about the farm,
immediately after breakfast, having told the ladies that they could
have the waggonnette when they pleased. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you'll find it
tiresome driving about our lanes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said. Lady Carbury assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was never dull when left alone with books. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was
starting he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went into the garden and plucked a rose which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brought
to Henrietta. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) only smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) gave it her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), and then went his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would say nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) suit
till Monday. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could prevail with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) to
remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother and brother would be going out to
dine at Caversham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) took the rose
and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in a whisper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) fully appreciated the truth, and
honour, and honesty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) character, and could have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) so
dearly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would have contented himself with such
cousinly love! She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was beginning, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) heart, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) side
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother and brother, and to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was the safest
guide that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could have. But how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) be guided by a lover
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) did not love?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid, my dear, we shall have a bad time of it here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said
Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be so dull. Your cousin is the best friend in all the world,
and would make as good a husband as could be picked out of all the
gentlemen of England; but in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) present mood with me he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is not a
comfortable host. What nonsense he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did talk about the Melmottes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose, mamma, that Mr. and Mrs. Melmotte can be nice
people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't they be as nice as anybody else? Pray, Henrietta,
don't let us have any of that nonsense from you. When it comes from
the superhuman virtue of poor dear Roger it has to be borne, but I
beg that you will not copy him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I think that is unkind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shall think it very unkind if you take upon yourself to abuse
people who are able and willing to set poor Felix on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) legs. A word
from you might undo all that we are doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What word? Any word! If you have any influence with your brother you
should use it in inducing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to hurry this on. I am sure the girl is
willing enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did refer him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why does he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not go to Mr. Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is delicate about it on the score of money. If Roger
could only let it be understood that Felix is the heir to this place,
and that some day he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will be Sir Felix Carbury of Carbury, I don't
think there would be any difficulty even with old Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) do that, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If your cousin were to die as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is now, it would be so. Your
brother would be his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not think of such a thing, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you dare to tell me what I am to think? Am I not to think
of my own son? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) not to be dearer to me than any one? And what
I say, is so. If Roger were to die to-morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would be Sir Felix
Carbury of Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, mamma, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will live and have a family. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is so old that you will not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said so. When we were joking, I said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was old. You know
I did not mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was too old to get married. Men a great deal
older get married every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will never marry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is a man of that
kind,--so stiff and stubborn and old-fashioned that nothing will
change him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will go on boodying over it, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will become an
old misanthrope. If you would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) I would be quite contented.
You are my child as well as Felix. But if you mean to be obstinate
I do wish that the Melmottes should be made to understand that the
property and title and name of the place will all go together. It
will be so, and why should not Felix have the advantage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is to say it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah;--that's where it is. Roger is so violent and prejudiced that one
cannot get him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to speak rationally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma;--you wouldn't suggest it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>);--that this place is to
go to--Felix, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)--is dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) a day sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not dare to do it, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would dare to do anything for my children. But you need not look
like that, Henrietta. I am not going to say anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) of the
kind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is not quick enough to understand of what infinite service
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might be to us without in any way hurting himself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div>Henrietta
would fain have answered that their cousin was quick enough for
anything, but was by far too honest to take part in such a scheme
as that proposed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) refrained, however, and was silent. There
was no sympathy on the matter between her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was
beginning to understand the tortuous mazes of manoeuvres in which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother's mind had learned to work, and to dislike and almost to
despise them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) felt it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) duty to abstain from rebukes.

<p/>In the afternoon Lady Carbury, alone, had herself driven into Beccles
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might telegraph to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``You are to dine at Caversham
on Monday. Come on Saturday if you can. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) is there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury
had many doubts as to the wording of this message. The female in
the office might too probably understand who was the <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>The female</b></font>)</div>who
was spoken of as being at Caversham, and might understand also
the project, and speak of it publicly. But then it was essential
that Felix should know how great and certain was the opportunity
afforded to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had promised to come on Saturday and return on
Monday,--and, unless warned, would too probably stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) plan and
throw over the Longestaffes and their dinner-party. Again if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) were
told to come simply for the Monday, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would throw over the chance
of wooing her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) on the Sunday. It was Lady Carbury's desire to get him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
down for as long a period as was possible, and nothing surely would
so tend to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), as a knowledge that the heiress
was already in the neighbourhood. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) returned, and shut herself
up in her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) bedroom, and worked for an hour or two at a paper which she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)
was writing for the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Nobody should ever accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)
justly of idleness. And afterwards, as she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) walked by herself round
and round the garden, she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) revolved in her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) mind the scheme of a new
book. Whatever might happen she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) would persevere. If the Carburys
were unfortunate their misfortunes should come from no fault of hers.
Henrietta passed the whole day alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin from
breakfast till he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) appeared in the drawing-room before dinner. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
was thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) during every minute of the day,--how good he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was,
how honest, how thoroughly entitled to demand at any rate kindness
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) hand! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother had spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) as of one who might be
regarded as all but dead and buried, simply because of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) love for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>). Could it be true that his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) constancy was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would never
marry unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would take his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hand? She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) came to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) with
more tenderness than she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had ever felt before, but, yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would
not tell herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). It might, perhaps, be her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) duty to
give herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) without loving him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),--because he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was so good; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).

<p/>In the evening the bishop came, and his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) wife, Mrs. Yeld, and the
Hepworths of Eardly, and Father John Barham, the Beccles priest. The
party consisted of eight, which is, perhaps, the best number for a
mixed gathering of men and women at a dinner-table,--especially if
there be no mistress whose prerogative and duty it is to sit opposite
to the master. In this case Mr. Hepworth faced the giver of the
feast, the bishop and the priest were opposite to each other, and the
ladies graced the four corners. Roger, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke of such things
to no one, turned them over much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind, believing it to be the
duty of a host to administer in all things to the comfort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
guests. In the drawing-room he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been especially courteous to the
young priest, introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) first to the bishop and his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) wife, and
then to his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) cousins. Henrietta watched him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) through the whole evening,
and told herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was a very mirror of courtesy in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own
house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had seen it all before, no doubt; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had never
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) now watched him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) would die wifeless and childless because she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would not be his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) wife
and the mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) children.

<p/>The bishop was a man sixty years of age, very healthy and handsome,
with hair just becoming grey, clear eyes, a kindly mouth, and
something of a double chin. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was all but six feet high, with a
broad chest, large hands, and legs which seemed to have been made for
clerical breeches and clerical stockings. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was a man of fortune
outside his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) bishopric; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) never went up to London, and had
no children on whom to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) money, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was able to live as a
nobleman in the country. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did live as a nobleman, and was very
popular. Among the poor around him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was idolized, and by such
clergy of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) diocese as were not enthusiastic in their theology
either on the one side or on the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was regarded as a model
bishop. By the very high and the very low,--by those rather who
regarded ritualism as being either heavenly or devilish,--he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was
looked upon as a time-server, because he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) would not put to sea in
either of those boats. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was an unselfish man, who loved his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
neighbour as himself, and forgave all trespasses, and thanked God for
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) daily bread from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart, and prayed heartily to be delivered
from temptation. But I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was competent to teach a
creed,--or even to hold one, if it be necessary that a man should
understand and define his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) creed before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can hold it. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
free from, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was scared by, any inward misgivings, who
shall say? If there were such he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never whispered a word of them even
to the wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom. From the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice and the look
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, you would say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unscathed by that agony which
doubt on such a matter would surely bring to a man so placed. And yet
it was observed of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faith, or entered
into arguments with men as to the reasons on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had based it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was diligent in preaching,--moral sermons that were short, pithy,
and useful. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was never weary in furthering the welfare of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
clergymen. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house was open to them and to their wives. The edifice
of every church in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) diocese was a care to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laboured at
schools, and was zealous in improving the social comforts of the
poor; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was never known to declare to man or woman that the
human soul must live or die for ever according to its faith. Perhaps
there was no bishop in England more loved or more useful in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)
diocese than the Bishop of Elmham.

<p/>A man more antagonistic to the bishop than Father John Barham, the
lately appointed Roman Catholic priest at Beccles, it would be
impossible to conceive;--and yet they were both eminently good men.
Father John was not above five feet nine in height, but so thin, so
meagre, so wasted in appearance, that, unless when he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) stooped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
was taken to be tall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had thick dark brown hair, which was cut
short in accordance with the usage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) Church; but which he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) so
constantly ruffled by the action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hands, that, though short, it
seemed to be wild and uncombed. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) younger days, when long locks
straggled over his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) forehead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had acquired a habit, while talking
energetically, of rubbing them back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) finger, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had not
since dropped. In discussions he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would constantly push back his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hair,
and then sit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand fixed on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had a
high, broad forehead, enormous blue eyes, a thin, long nose, cheeks
very thin and hollow, a handsome large mouth, and a strong square
chin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was utterly without worldly means, except those which came
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) from the ministry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) church, and which did not suffice to
find him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) food and raiment; but no man ever lived more indifferent to
such matters than Father John Barham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had been the younger son
of an English country gentleman of small fortune, had been sent to
Oxford that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) might hold a family living, and on the eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>)
ordination had declared himself a Roman Catholic. His (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) family had
resented this bitterly, but had not quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had
drawn a sister with him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>). When banished from the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had still
striven to achieve the conversion of other sisters by his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) letters,
and was now absolutely an alien from his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) father's heart and care.
But of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) never complained. It was a part of the plan of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>)
life that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) should suffer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) faith. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) been able to change
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) creed without incurring persecution, worldly degradation, and
poverty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) own conversion would not have been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) comfortable
and satisfactory as it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) considered that his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) father, as a
Protestant,--and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) mind Protestant and heathen were all the
same,--had been right to quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) father,
and was endless in prayer, wearying his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) saints with supplications,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) father might see the truth and be as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was.

<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) it was everything that a man should believe and obey,--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own reason to the care of another or of others,
and allow himself to be guided in all things by authority. Faith
being sufficient and of itself all in all, moral conduct could be
nothing to a man, except as a testimony of faith; for to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), whose
belief was true enough to produce obedience, moral conduct would
certainly be added. The dogmas of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Church were to Father Barham
a real religion; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) would teach them in season and out of
season, always ready to commit himself to the task of proving their
truth, afraid of no enemy, not even fearing the hostility which his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>)
perseverance would create. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had but one duty before him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>),--to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>)
part towards bringing over the world to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) faith. It might be that
with the toil of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) whole life he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) should convert but one; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>)
should but half convert one; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) should do no more than disturb
the thoughts of one so that future conversion might be possible. But
even that would be work done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) would sow the seed if it might be
so; but if it were not given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) to do that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) would at any rate
plough the ground.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had come to Beccles lately, and Roger Carbury had found out that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was a gentleman by birth and education. Roger had found out
also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was very poor, and had consequently taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) by the
hand. The young priest had not hesitated to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) neighbour's
hospitality, having on one occasion laughingly protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
should be delighted to dine at Carbury, as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was much in want of
a dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had accepted presents from the garden and the poultry
yard, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was too poor to refuse anything. The apparent
frankness of the man about himself had charmed Roger, and the charm
had not been seriously disturbed when Father Barham, on one winter
evening in the parlour at Carbury, had tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) hand at converting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) host. <div class="bookquote">``I have the most thorough respect for your religion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger
had said; <div class="bookquote">``but it would not suit me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>The priest had gone on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
logic; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not sow the seed he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might plough the ground. This
had been repeated two or three times, and Roger had begun to feel it
to be disagreeable. But the man was in earnest, and such earnestness
commanded respect. And Roger was quite sure that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might be
bored, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not be injured by such teaching. Then it occurred to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) one day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had known the Bishop of Elmham intimately for a
dozen years, and had never heard from the bishop's mouth,--except
when in the pulpit,--a single word of religious teaching; whereas
this man, who was a stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), divided from him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) by the very
fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) creed, was always talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) faith. Roger
Carbury was not a man given to much deep thinking, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) felt that
the bishop's manner was the pleasanter of the two.

<p/>Lady Carbury at dinner was all smiles and pleasantness. No one
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), or listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), could think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heart was
sore with many troubles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sat between the bishop and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin,
and was skilful enough to talk to each without neglecting the other.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had known the bishop before, and had on one occasion spoken to
him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) soul. The first tone of the good man's reply had convinced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) error, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) never repeated it. To Mr. Alf she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) commonly
talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind; to Mr. Broune of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heart; to Mr. Booker of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) body--and its wants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was quite ready to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) soul on
a proper occasion, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was much too wise to thrust the subject
even on a bishop. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was full of the charms of Carbury and its
neighbourhood. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop, ``I think Suffolk is a
very nice county; and as we are only a mile or two from Norfolk, I'll
say as much for Norfolk too. <div class="bookquote">``It's an ill bird that fouls its own
nest.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like a county in which there is something left of county feeling,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``Staffordshire and Warwickshire, Cheshire and
Lancashire have become great towns, and have lost all local
distinctions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We still keep our name and reputation,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop Suffolk</b></font>)</div>said the bishop; <div class="bookquote">``Silly
Suffolk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bishop Suffolk</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that was never deserved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As much, perhaps, as other general epithets. I think we are a sleepy
people. We've got no coal, you see, and no iron. We have no beautiful
scenery, like the lake country,--no rivers great for fishing, like
Scotland,--no hunting grounds, like the shires.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partridges!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>pleaded Lady Carbury, with pretty energy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; we have partridges, fine churches, and the herring fishery.
We shall do very well if too much is not expected of us. We can't
increase and multiply as they do in the great cities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like this part of England so much the best for that very reason.
What is the use of a crowded population?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The earth has to be peopled, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ladyship, with some little reverence added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
voice, feeling that the bishop was probably adverting to a divine
arrangement. <div class="bookquote">``The world must be peopled; but for myself I like the
country better than the town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger; <div class="bookquote">``and I like Suffolk. The people are hearty,
and radicalism is not quite so rampant as it is elsewhere. The poor
people touch their hats, and the rich people think of the poor. There
is something left among us of old English habits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is so nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something left of old English ignorance,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop. <div class="bookquote">``All the
same I dare say we're improving, like the rest of the world. What
beautiful flowers you have here, Mr. Carbury! At any rate, we can
grow flowers in Suffolk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeld</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Yeld, the bishop's wife, was sitting next to the priest, and
was in truth somewhat afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) neighbour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) was, perhaps, a
little stauncher than her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) husband in Protestantism; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>)
was willing to admit that Mr. Barham might not have ceased to be a
gentleman when he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) became a Roman Catholic priest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) was not quite
sure that it was expedient for her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) husband to have much to do
with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Mr. Carbury had not taken them unawares. Notice had been
given that the priest was to be there, and the bishop had declared
that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) would be very happy to meet the priest. But Mrs. Yeld had had
her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) misgivings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) never ventured to insist on her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) opinion after the
bishop had expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) had an idea that right was right,
and wrong wrong,--and that Roman Catholics were wrong, and therefore
ought to be put down. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) thought also that if there were no
priests there would be no Roman Catholics. Mr. Barham was, no doubt,
a man of good family, which did make a difference.

<p/>Mr. Barham always made his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) approaches very gradually. The taciturn
humility with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) operations was in exact
proportion to the enthusiastic volubility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) advanced intimacy.
Mrs. Yeld thought that it became her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) to address to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) a few civil
words, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) with a shame-faced modesty that almost
overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) dislike to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) profession. She (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) spoke of the poor
of Beccles, being very careful to allude only to their material
position. There was too much beer drunk, no doubt, and the young
women would have finery. Where did they get the money to buy those
wonderful bonnets which appeared every Sunday? Mr. Barham was very
meek, and agreed to everything that was said. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had a plan
ready formed for inducing Mrs. Yeld to have mass said regularly
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) husband's palace, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not even begin to bring it
about on this occasion. It was not till he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) made some apparently
chance allusion to the superior church-attending qualities of <div class="bookquote">``our
people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that Mrs. Yeld drew herself up and changed the conversation
by observing that there had been a great deal of rain lately.

<p/>When the ladies were gone the bishop at once put himself in the
way of conversation with the priest, and asked questions as to the
morality of Beccles. It was evidently Mr. Barham's opinion that <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
people''  (<font color='red'><b>Barham/Mr. Barham/BARHAM</b></font>)</div>were more moral than other people, though very much poorer.
<div class="bookquote">``But the Irish always drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hepworth/Hepworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hepworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so much as the English, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>said the priest. <div class="bookquote">``And you
are not to suppose that we are all Irish. Of my flock the greater
proportion are English.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is astonishing how little we know of our neighbours,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the
bishop. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I am aware that there are a certain number of
persons of your persuasion round about us. Indeed, I could give the
exact number in this diocese. But in my own immediate neighbourhood
I could not put my hand upon any families which I know to be Roman
Catholic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not, my lord, because there are none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. It is because, as I say, I do not know my
neighbours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, here in Suffolk, they must be chiefly the poor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hepworth/Hepworth</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Hepworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They were chiefly the poor who at first put their faith in our
Saviour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>said the priest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the analogy is hardly correctly drawn,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop,
with a curious smile. <div class="bookquote">``We were speaking of those who are still
attached to an old creed. Our Saviour was the teacher of a new
religion. That the poor in the simplicity of their hearts should be
the first to acknowledge the truth of a new religion is in accordance
with our idea of human nature. But that an old faith should remain
with the poor after it has been abandoned by the rich is not so
easily intelligible.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: The bishop thinks that the priest's analogy
is not correct.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Roman population still believed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Carbury, <div class="bookquote">``when the
patricians had learned to regard their gods as simply useful
bugbears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The patricians had not ostensibly abandoned their religion. The
people clung to it thinking that their masters and rulers clung to it
also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor have ever been the salt of the earth, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>said the
priest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That begs the whole question,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) host,
and beginning to talk about a breed of pigs which had lately been
imported into the palace styes. Father Barham turned to Mr. Hepworth
and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) argument, or rather began another. It was a
mistake to suppose that the Catholics in the county were all poor.
There were the A--s and the B--s, and the C--s and the D--s.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) knew all their names and was proud of their fidelity. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) these
faithful ones were really the salt of the earth, who would some day
be enabled by their fidelity to restore England to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) pristine
condition. The bishop had truly said that of many of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) neighbours
he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) did not know to what Church they belonged; but Father Barham,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had not as yet been twelve months in the county, knew the
name of nearly every Roman Catholic within its borders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your priest is a very zealous man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop afterwards
to Roger Carbury, <div class="bookquote">``and I do not doubt but that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is an excellent
gentleman; but he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is perhaps a little indiscreet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is doing the best he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) can according to his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
lights; without any reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) own worldly welfare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is all very grand, and I am perfectly willing to respect him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>).
But I do not know that I should care to talk very freely in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)
company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would repeat nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not; but he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would always be thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was going to
get the best of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it answers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Yeld</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Yeld to her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) husband as they

are Protestants, and Roman Catholics are Roman Catholics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may say the same of Liberals and Conservatives, but you wouldn't
have them decline to meet each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't quite the same, my dear. After all religion is religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ought to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't mean to put myself up against you, my dear; but I
don't know that I want to meet Mr. Barham again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I do, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div>said the bishop; <div class="bookquote">``but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) comes
in my way I hope I shall treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) civilly.''




 (<font color='red'><b>the bishop</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVII.

<p/>MARIE MELMOTTE HEARS A LOVE TALE.


<p/>On the following morning there came a telegram from Felix. He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was
to be expected at Beccles on that afternoon by a certain train; and
Roger, at Lady Carbury's request, undertook to send a carriage to the
station for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). This was done, but Felix did not arrive. There was
still another train by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might come so as to be just in time
for dinner if dinner were postponed for half an hour. Lady Carbury
with a tender look, almost without speaking a word, appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
cousin on behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knit his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brows, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) always did,
involuntarily, when displeased; but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) assented. Then the carriage
had to be sent again. Now carriages and carriage-horses were not
numerous at Carbury. The squire kept a waggonnette and a pair of
horses which, when not wanted for house use, were employed about the
farm. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) himself would walk home from the train, leaving the luggage
to be brought by some cheap conveyance. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had already sent the
carriage once on this day,--and now sent it again, Lady Carbury
having said a word which showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hoped that this would be
done. But he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) did it with deep displeasure. To the mother her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son was
Sir Felix, the baronet, entitled to special consideration because of
his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) position and rank,--because also of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) intention to marry the
great heiress of the day. To Roger Carbury, Felix was a vicious young
man, peculiarly antipathetic to himself, to whom no respect whatever
was due. Nevertheless the dinner was put off, and the waggonnette was
sent. But the waggonnette again came back empty. That evening was
spent by Roger, Lady Carbury, and Henrietta, in very much gloom.

<p/>About four in the morning the house was roused by the coming of the
baronet. Failing to leave town by either of the afternoon trains,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had contrived to catch the evening mail, and had found himself
deposited at some distant town from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had posted to Carbury.
Roger came down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) dressing-gown to admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and Lady Carbury
also left her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) room. Sir Felix evidently thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been a
very fine fellow in going through so much trouble. Roger held a very
different opinion, and spoke little or nothing. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the
mother, <div class="bookquote">``you have so terrified us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you I was terrified myself when I found that I had to
come fifteen miles across the country with a pair of old jades who
could hardly get up a trot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why didn't you come by the train you named?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't get out of the city,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet with a ready lie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you were at the Board?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>To this Felix made no direct
answer. Roger knew that there had been no Board. Mr. Melmotte was in
the country and there could be no Board, nor could Sir Felix have had
business in the city. It was sheer impudence,--sheer indifference,
and, into the bargain, a downright lie. The young man, who was
of himself so unwelcome, who had come there on a project which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Roger, utterly disapproved,--who had now knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
household up at four o'clock in the morning,--had uttered no word of
apology. <div class="bookquote">``Miserable cub!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger muttered between his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) teeth. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
spoke aloud, <div class="bookquote">``You had better not keep your mother standing here. I
will show you your room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully sorry to
disturb you all in this way. I think I'll just take a drop of brandy
and soda before I go to bed, though.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>This was another blow to Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt whether we have soda-water in the house, and if we have,
I don't know where to get it. I can give you some brandy if you
will come with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pronounced the word <div class="bookquote">``brandy''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>in a tone which
implied that it was a wicked, dissipated beverage. It was a wretched
work to Roger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was forced to go up-stairs and fetch a key in order
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might wait upon this cub,--this cur! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did it, however, and
the cub drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brandy-and-water, not in the least disturbed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
host's ill-humour. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went to bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) suggested the probability
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) not showing himself till lunch on the following day, and
expressed a wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might have breakfast sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in bed.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is born to be hung,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
room,--<div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll deserve it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On the following morning, being Sunday, they all went to
church,--except Felix. Lady Carbury always went to church when she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
was in the country, never when she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was at home in London. It was
one of those moral habits, like early dinners and long walks, which
suited country life. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) fancied that were she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) not to do so, the
bishop would be sure to know it and would be displeased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) liked
the bishop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) liked bishops generally; and was aware that it was a
woman's duty to sacrifice herself for society. As to the purpose for
which people go to church, it had probably never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) life occurred
to Lady Carbury to think of it. On their return they found Sir Felix
smoking a cigar on the gravel path, close in front of the open
drawing-room window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) cousin, <div class="bookquote">``take your cigar a little farther. You are
filling the house with tobacco.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh heavens,--what a prejudice!''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it be so, but still do as I ask you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix chucked the
cigar out of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) mouth on to the gravel walk, whereupon Roger walked
up to the spot and kicked the offending weed away. This was the first
greeting of the day between the two men.

<p/>After lunch Lady Carbury strolled about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son, instigating him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
to go over at once to Caversham. <div class="bookquote">``How the deuce am I to get there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your cousin will lend you a horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s as cross as a bear with a sore head. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s a deal older than
I am, and a cousin and all that, but I'm not going to put up with
insolence. If it were anywhere else I should just go into the yard
and ask if I could have a horse and saddle as a matter of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger has not a great establishment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has a horse and saddle, and a man to get it ready. I
don't want anything grand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is vexed because he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sent twice to the station for you yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate the kind of fellow who is always thinking of little
grievances. Such a man expects you to go like clockwork, and because
you are not wound up just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insults you. I shall ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
for a horse as I would any one else, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not like it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
may lump it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>About half an hour after this he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``Can
I have a horse to ride over to Caversham this afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our horses never go out on Sunday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) added, after
a pause, <div class="bookquote">``You can have it. I'll give the order.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix would
be gone on Tuesday, and it should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own fault if that odious
cousin ever found his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) way into Carbury House again! So he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) declared
to himself as Felix rode out of the yard; but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) soon remembered how
probable it was that Felix himself would be the owner of Carbury. And
should it ever come to pass,--as still was possible,--that Henrietta
should be the mistress of Carbury, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) could hardly forbid her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) to
receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) stood for a while on the bridge watching his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
cousin as he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) cantered away upon the road, listening to the horse's
feet. The young man was offensive in every possible way. Who does not
know that ladies only are allowed to canter their friends' horses
upon roads? A gentleman trots his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) horse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friend's horse.
Roger Carbury had but one saddle horse,--a favourite old hunter
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) loved as a friend. And now this dear old friend, whose legs
probably were not quite so good as they once were, was being galloped
along the hard road by that odious cub! <div class="bookquote">``Soda and brandy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger
exclaimed to himself almost aloud, thinking of the discomfiture of
that early morning. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll die some day of delirium tremens in a
hospital!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/>Before the Longestaffes left London to receive their new friends
the Melmottes at Caversham, a treaty had been made between Mr.
Longestaffe, the father, and Georgiana, the strong-minded daughter.
The daughter on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) side undertook that the guests should be treated
with feminine courtesy. This might be called the most-favoured-nation
clause. The Melmottes were to be treated exactly as though old
Melmotte had been a gentleman and Madame Melmotte a lady. In return
for this the Longestaffe family were to be allowed to return to town.
But here again the father had carried another clause. The prolonged
sojourn in town was to be only for six weeks. On the 10th of July the
Longestaffes were to be removed into the country for the remainder
of the year. When the question of a foreign tour was proposed, the
father became absolutely violent in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) refusal. <div class="bookquote">``In God's name where
do you expect the money is to come from?''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>When Georgiana urged that
other people had money to go abroad, her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father told her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) that a time
was coming in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) might think it lucky if she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had a house over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) head. This, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) took as having been said with poetical
licence, the same threat having been made more than once before.
The treaty was very clear, and the parties to it were prepared to
carry it out with fair honesty. The Melmottes were being treated with
decent courtesy, and the house in town was not dismantled.

<p/>The idea, hardly ever in truth entertained but which had been barely
suggested from one to another among the ladies of the family, that
Dolly should marry Marie Melmotte, had been abandoned. Dolly, with
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) vapid folly, had a will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own, which, among his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own
family, was invincible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was never persuaded to any course either
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) father or mother. Dolly certainly would not marry Marie
Melmotte. Therefore when the Longestaffes heard that Sir Felix was
coming to the country, they had no special objection to entertaining
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) at Caversham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had been lately talked of in London as the
favourite in regard to Marie Melmotte. Georgiana Longestaffe had a
grudge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own against Lord Nidderdale, and was on that account
somewhat well inclined towards Sir Felix's prospects. Soon after the
Melmottes' arrival she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) contrived to say a word to Marie respecting
Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``There is a friend of yours going to dine here on Monday,
Miss Melmotte.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie, who was at the moment still abashed by the
grandeur and size and general fashionable haughtiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) new
acquaintances, made hardly any answer. <div class="bookquote">``I think you know Sir Felix
Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>continued Georgiana.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, we know Sir Felix Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is coming down to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cousin's. I suppose it is for your bright
eyes, as Carbury Manor would hardly be just what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is coming because of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie blushing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
had once told him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) might go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father, which according to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) idea had been tantamount to accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) offer as far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
power of acceptance went. Since that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>), indeed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>)
had not said a word to press his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) suit, nor, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) knew, had
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) said a word to Mr. Melmotte. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been very rigorous in
declining the attentions of other suitors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mind
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was in love with Felix Carbury, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had resolved on
constancy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had begun to tremble, fearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) faithlessness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was a particular friend of
yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) laughed aloud, with a vulgarity which Madame Melmotte
certainly could not have surpassed.

<p/>Sir Felix, on the Sunday afternoon, found all the ladies out on the
lawn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) also found Mr. Melmotte there. At the last moment Lord
Alfred Grendall had been asked,--not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was at all in favour
with any of the Longestaffes, but in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) might be useful
in disposing of the great Director. Lord Alfred was used to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) and
could talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), and might probably know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) liked to eat and
drink. Therefore Lord Alfred had been asked to Caversham, and Lord
Alfred had come, having all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) expenses paid by the great Director.
When Sir Felix arrived, Lord Alfred was earning his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) entertainment by
talking to Mr. Melmotte in a summer-house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had cool drink before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and a box of cigars, but was probably thinking at the time how
hard the world had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Lady Pomona was languid, but not
uncivil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) reception. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) best to perform her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
part of the treaty in reference to Madame Melmotte. Sophia was
walking apart with a certain Mr. Whitstable, a young squire in the
neighbourhood, who had been asked to Caversham because as Sophia was
now reputed to be twenty-eight,--they who decided the question might
have said thirty-one without falsehood,--it was considered that Mr.
Whitstable was good enough, or at least as good as could be expected.
Sophia was handsome, but with a big, cold, unalluring handsomeness,
and had not quite succeeded in London. Georgiana had been more
admired, and boasted among her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) friends of the offers which she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had
rejected. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) friends on the other hand were apt to tell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) many
failures. Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) head up, and had not as yet come
down among the rural Whitstables. At the present moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) hands
were empty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was devoting herself to such a performance of the
treaty as should make it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) part
of it unfulfilled.

<p/>For a few minutes Sir Felix sat on a garden chair making conversation
to Lady Pomona and Madame Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``Beautiful garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``for
myself I don't much care for gardens; but if one is to live in the
country, this is the sort of thing that one would like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Delicious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Madame Melmotte, repressing a yawn, and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
shawl higher round her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) throat. It was the end of May, and the weather
was very warm for the time of the year; but, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) heart of hearts,
Madame Melmotte did not like sitting out in the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't a pretty place; but the house is comfortable, and we make
the best of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Plenty of glass, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``If one is to live in the
country, I like that kind of thing. Carbury is a very poor place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was offence in this;--as though the Carbury property and the
Carbury position could be compared to the Longestaffe property and
the Longestaffe position. Though dreadfully hampered for money,
the Longestaffes were great people. <div class="bookquote">``For a small place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Pomona, <div class="bookquote">``I think Carbury is one of the nicest in the county. Of
course it is not extensive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, by Jove,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, <div class="bookquote">``you may say that, Lady Pomona. It's
like a prison to me with that moat round it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) jumped up and
joined Marie Melmotte and Georgiana. Georgiana, glad to be released
for a time from performance of the treaty, was not long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
left them together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had understood that the two horses now in the
running were Lord Nidderdale and Sir Felix; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would not
probably have done much to aid Sir Felix, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was quite willing to
destroy Lord Nidderdale.

<p/>Sir Felix had his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) work to do, and was willing to do it,--as far as
such willingness could go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). The prize was so great, and the
comfort of wealth was so sure, that even he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was tempted to exert
himself. It was this feeling which had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) into Suffolk, and
induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) to travel all night, across dirty roads, in an old cab.
For the girl herself he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) cared not the least. It was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) power
really to care for anybody. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) did not dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was
not given to disliking people strongly, except at the moments in
which they offended him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) simply as the means by
which a portion of Mr. Melmotte's wealth might be conveyed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
uses. In regard to feminine beauty he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own ideas, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
inclinations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was by no means indifferent to such attraction. But
Marie Melmotte, from that point of view, was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Such
prettiness as belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) came from the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) youth,
and from a modest shy demeanour joined to an incipient aspiration
for the enjoyment of something in the world which should be her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own.
There was, too, arising within her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bosom a struggle to be something
in the world, an idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), too, could say something, and have
thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own, if only she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had some friend near her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
need not fear. Though still shy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was always resolving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) shyness, and already had thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own as to
the perfectly open confidence which should exist between two lovers.
When alone,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was much alone,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would build castles in
the air, which were bright with art and love, rather than with gems
and gold. The books she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) read, poor though they generally were, left
something bright on her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) fancied to herself brilliant
conversations in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bore a bright part, though in real life
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had hitherto hardly talked to any one since she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a child. Sir
Felix Carbury, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew, had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) an offer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew also, or
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) loved the man. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alone! Now surely had come the time in which some one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
castles in the air might be found to be built of real materials.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know why I have come down here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

glad to see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, who could not at once find that

enough in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) solitude.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By George, I did. I was quite in earnest. There never was a fellow

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether you love me well enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) longed to be told
by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no objection to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) so, but,
without thinking much about it, felt it to be a bore. All that kind
of thing was trash and twaddle. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would have wished, were it possible, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) should have gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
father for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) consent. There was something in the big eyes and heavy

well enough?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do. I'm bad at making pretty speeches, and all that, but

saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) eyes were swimming with tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought at the moment
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was very common to look at. As regarded appearance only he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would have preferred even Sophia Longestaffe. There was indeed a
certain brightness of truth which another man might have read in
Marie's mingled smiles and tears, but it was thrown away altogether
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). They were walking in some shrubbery quite apart from the
house, where they were unseen; so, as in duty bound, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) waist and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether Madame Melmotte ought not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no. Nothing would induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is more afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'll do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Why

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) made me a Director of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) companies the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'ll like you for a son-in-law.''

put her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) face up towards his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, not thinking it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) while to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the country,--in another person's house. Shall you tell
Madame Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall tell mamma; but she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) won't say anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Mamma
does not care much about me. But I'll tell you all that another time.
Of course I shall tell you everything now. I never yet had anybody to

he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, and escaped to the other ladies. Mr.
Melmotte was still sitting in the summer-house, and Lord Alfred was
still with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), smoking and drinking brandy and seltzer. As Sir Felix
passed in front of the great man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told himself that it was much
better that the interview should be postponed till they were all in
London. Mr. Melmotte did not look as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were in a good humour.
Sir Felix said a few words to Lady Pomona and Madame Melmotte. Yes;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hoped to have the pleasure of seeing them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mother and
sister on the following day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) cousin was not
coming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) cousin Roger never did go any where like
any one else. No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not seen Mr. Longestaffe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hoped to have
the pleasure of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to-morrow. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) escaped, and got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
horse, and rode away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's going to be the lucky man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother,
that evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way lucky?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is going to get the heiress and all the money. What a fool Dolly

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it would have suited Dolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona. <div class="bookquote">``After

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVIII.

<p/>RUBY RUGGLES HEARS A LOVE TALE.


<p/>Miss Ruby Ruggles, the granddaughter of old Daniel Ruggles, of
Sheep's Acre, in the parish of Sheepstone, close to Bungay, received
the following letter from the hands of the rural post letter-carrier
on that Sunday morning;--<div class="bookquote">``A friend will be somewhere near Sheepstone
Birches between four and five o'clock on Sunday afternoon.''  (<font color='red'><b>the post letter-carrier</b></font>)</div>There was
not another word in the letter, but Miss Ruby Ruggles knew well from
whom it came.

<p/>Daniel Ruggles was a farmer, who had the reputation of considerable
wealth, but who was not very well looked on in the neighbourhood as
being somewhat of a curmudgeon and a miser. His (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) wife was dead;--he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>)
had quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) only son, whose wife was also dead, and
had banished him (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) home;--his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) daughters were married and
away; and the only member of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) family who lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
granddaughter Ruby. And this granddaughter was a great trouble to the
old man. She (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) was twenty-three years old, and had been engaged to a
prosperous young man at Bungay in the meal and pollard line, to whom
old Ruggles had promised to give #500 on their marriage. But Ruby had
taken it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) foolish young head that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did not like meal and
pollard, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had received the above very dangerous letter.
Though the writer had not dared to sign his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) name she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) knew well that
it came from Sir Felix Carbury,--the most beautiful gentleman she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
ever set her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes upon. Poor Ruby Ruggles! Living down at Sheep's
Acre, on the Waveney, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had heard both too much and too little
of the great world beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) ken. There were, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) thought, many
glorious things to be seen which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would never see were she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) in
these her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) early years to become the wife of John Crumb, the dealer
in meal and pollard at Bungay. Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was full of a wild
joy, half joy half fear, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) letter; and, therefore,
punctually at four o'clock on that Sunday she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was ensconced among
the Sheepstone Birches, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) might see without much danger of
being seen. Poor Ruby Ruggles, who was left to be so much mistress
of herself at the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) life in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) most required the
kindness of a controlling hand!

<p/>Mr. Ruggles held his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) land, or the greater part of it, on what is
called a bishop's lease, Sheep's Acre Farm being a part of the
property which did belong to the bishopric of Elmham, and which was
still set apart for its sustentation;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) also held a small
extent of outlying meadow which belonged to the Carbury estate, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) was one of the tenants of Roger Carbury. Those Sheepstone
Birches, at which Felix made his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) appointment, belonged to Roger. On a
former occasion, when the feeling between the two cousins was kinder
than that which now existed, Felix had ridden over with the landlord
to call on the old man, and had then first seen Ruby;--and had heard
from Roger something of Ruby's history up to that date. It had then
been just made known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was to marry John Crumb. Since that
time not a word had been spoken between the men respecting the girl.
Mr. Carbury had heard, with sorrow, that the marriage was either
postponed or abandoned,--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) growing dislike to the baronet had
made it very improbable that there should be any conversation between
them on the subject. Sir Felix, however, had probably heard more of
Ruby Ruggles than her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) grandfather's landlord.

<p/>There is, perhaps, no condition of mind more difficult for the
ordinarily well-instructed inhabitant of a city to realise than that
of such a girl as Ruby Ruggles. The rural day labourer and his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) wife
live on a level surface which is comparatively open to the eye. Their
aspirations, whether for good or evil,--whether for food and drink to
be honestly earned for themselves and children, or for drink first,
to be come by either honestly or dishonestly,--are, if looked at at
all, fairly visible. And with the men of the Ruggles class one can
generally find out what they would be at, and in what direction
their minds are at work. But the Ruggles woman,--especially the
Ruggles young woman,--is better educated, has higher aspirations and
a brighter imagination, and is infinitely more cunning than the man.
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) be good-looking and relieved from the pressure of want, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
thoughts soar into a world which is as unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) as heaven is
to us, and in regard to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) longings are apt to be infinitely
stronger than are ours for heaven. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) education has been much better
than that of the man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) can read, whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can only spell words
from a book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) can write a letter after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) fashion, whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can
barely spell words out on a paper. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) tongue is more glib, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
intellect sharper. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) ignorance as to the reality of things
is much more gross than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). By such contact as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has with men in
markets, in the streets of the towns he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) frequents, and even in the
fields, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learns something unconsciously of the relative condition
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countrymen,--and, as to that which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not learn, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
imagination is obtuse. But the woman builds castles in the air, and
wonders, and longs. To the young farmer the squire's daughter is a
superior being very much out of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) way. To the farmer's daughter the
young squire is an Apollo, whom to look at is a pleasure,--by whom to
be looked at is a delight. The danger for the most part is soon over.
The girl marries after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kind, and then husband and children put
the matter at rest for ever.

<p/>A mind more absolutely uninstructed than that of Ruby Ruggles as to
the world beyond Suffolk and Norfolk it would be impossible to find.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) thoughts were as wide as they were vague, and as active as
they were erroneous. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) prettiness, and all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) cleverness,--with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) fortune to boot,--marry that dustiest
of all men, John Crumb, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had seen something of the beauties
of the things of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had read in the books which came in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
way? John Crumb was not bad-looking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) was a sturdy, honest fellow,
too,--slow of speech but sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) points when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had got them
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) grip,--fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) beer but not often drunk, and the very
soul of industry at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) work. But though she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
life she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had never known him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) otherwise than dusty. The meal had so
gotten within his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) hair, and skin, and raiment, that it never came
out altogether even on Sundays. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) normal complexion was a healthy
pallor, through which indeed some records of hidden ruddiness would
make themselves visible, but which was so judiciously assimilated to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) hat and coat and waistcoat, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) was more like a stout ghost
than a healthy young man. Nevertheless it was said of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could thrash any man in Bungay, and carry two hundred weight of flour
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back. And Ruby also knew this of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worshipped
the very ground on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) trod.

<p/>But, alas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) thought there might be something better than such
worship; and, therefore, when Felix Carbury came in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) way, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
beautiful oval face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rich brown colour, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bright hair
and lovely moustache, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was lost in a feeling which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mistook for
love; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sneaked over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) a second and a third time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
thought more of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listless praise than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had thought of John
Crumb's honest promises. But, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was an utter fool, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was
not a fool without a principle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was miserably ignorant; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
did understand that there was a degradation which it behoved her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) to
avoid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) thought, as the moths seem to think, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) might fly
into the flame and not burn her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) wings. After her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) fashion she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was
pretty, with long glossy ringlets, which those about the farm on
week days would see confined in curl-papers, and large round dark
eyes, and a clear dark complexion, in which the blood showed itself
plainly beneath the soft brown skin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was strong, and healthy, and
tall,--and had a will of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) own which gave infinite trouble to old
Daniel Ruggles, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) grandfather.

<p/>Felix Carbury took himself two miles out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) way in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
might return by Sheepstone Birches, which was a little copse distant
not above half a mile from Sheep's Acre farmhouse. A narrow angle
of the little wood came up to the road, by which there was a gate
leading into a grass meadow, which Sir Felix had remembered when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) appointment. The road was no more than a country lane,
unfrequented at all times, and almost sure to be deserted on Sundays.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) approached the gate in a walk, and then stood awhile looking into
the wood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had not stood long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) saw the girl's bonnet
beneath a tree standing just outside the wood, in the meadow, but
on the bank of the ditch. Thinking for a moment what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) would do
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) rode him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) into the field, and then, dismounting,
fastened him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) to a rail which ran down the side of the copse. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
sauntered on till he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) stood looking down upon Ruby Ruggles as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) sat
beneath the tree. <div class="bookquote">``I like your impudence,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``in calling
yourself a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't I a friend, Ruby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty sort of friend, you! When you was going away, you was to be
back at Carbury in a fortnight; and that is,--oh, ever so long ago
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I wrote to you, Ruby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's letters? And the postman to know all as in 'em for anything
anybody knows, and grandfather to be almost sure to see 'em. I don't
call letters no good at all, and I beg you won't write 'em any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) see them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No thanks to you if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) didn't. I don't know why you are come here,
Sir Felix,--nor yet I don't know why I should come and meet you. It's
all just folly like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I love you;--that's why I come; eh, Ruby? And you have come
because you love me; eh, Ruby? Is not that about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) threw
himself on the ground beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>), and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) waist.

<p/>It would boot little to tell here all that they said to each other.
The happiness of Ruby Ruggles for that half hour was no doubt
complete. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) London lover beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>); and though in every
word he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) spoke there was a tone of contempt, still he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) talked of love,
and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) promises, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) was pretty. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) probably
did not enjoy it much; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cared very little about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>), and carried
on the liaison simply because it was the proper sort of thing for a
young man to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had begun to think that the odour of patchouli
was unpleasant, and that the flies were troublesome, and the ground
hard, before the half hour was over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) could be
content to sit there for ever and to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). This was a
realisation of those delights of life of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had read in the
thrice-thumbed old novels which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had gotten from the little
circulating library at Bungay.

<p/>But what was to come next? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had not dared to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>),--had not dared to say those very words; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not dared to
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress. There was an animal courage about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>),
and an amount of strength also, and a fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) eye, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had learned to be aware. Before the half hour was over I think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished himself away;--but when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did go, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made a promise to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) again on the Tuesday morning. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) grandfather would be at
Harlestone market, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) would meet him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) at about noon at the bottom
of the kitchen garden belonging to the farm. As he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) made the promise
he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would not keep it. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) again,
and bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) come to him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) in London, and would send her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) money for the
journey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am to be his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) wedded wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
crept away down from the road, away also from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own home;--so that
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) return her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) presence should not be associated with that of the
young man, should any one chance to see the young man on the road.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll never be nothing unless I'm that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) said to herself. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) mind to lose itself in expatiating on the difference
between John Crumb and Sir Felix Carbury.




<p/>CHAPTER XIX.

<p/>HETTA CARBURY HEARS A LOVE TALE.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have half a mind to go back to-morrow morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Felix said to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mother that Sunday evening after dinner. At that moment Roger was
walking round the garden by himself, and Henrietta was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) own
room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow morning, Felix! You are engaged to dine with the
Longestaffes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could make any excuse you like about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be the most uncourteous thing in the world. The
Longestaffes you know are the leading people in this part of the
country. No one knows what may happen. If you should ever be living
at Carbury, how sad it would be that you should have quarrelled with
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget, mother, that Dolly Longestaffe is about the most
intimate friend I have in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That does not justify you in being uncivil to the father and mother.
And you should remember what you came here for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did I come for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you might see Marie Melmotte more at your ease than you can in
their London house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, in the most indifferent tone
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could assume.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Settled!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as the girl is concerned. I can't very well go to the old
fellow for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) consent down here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say, Felix, that Marie Melmotte has accepted you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you that before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Felix. Oh, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) joy the mother took her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) unwilling
son in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms and caressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). Here was the first step taken not
only to success, but to such magnificent splendour as should make
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son to be envied by all young men, and herself to be envied by
all mothers in England! <div class="bookquote">``No, you didn't tell me before. But I am so
happy. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) really fond of you? I don't wonder that any girl should
be fond of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say anything about that, but I think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) means to stick to
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is firm, of course her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father will give way at last. Fathers
always do give way when the girl is firm. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) oppose it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a man of rank, with a title of your own. I suppose what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wants is a gentleman for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) girl. I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should not be
perfectly satisfied. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) enormous wealth a thousand a year
or so can't make any difference. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made you one of the
Directors at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Board. Oh Felix;--it is almost too good to be true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ain't quite sure that I care very much about being married, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix, pray don't say that. Why shouldn't you like being
married? She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) is a very nice girl, and we shall all be so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)!
Don't let any feeling of that kind come over you; pray don't. You
will be able to do just what you please when once the question of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) money is settled. Of course you can hunt as often as you like,
and you can have a house in any part of London you please. You must
understand by this time how very disagreeable it is to have to get on
without an established income.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite understand that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If this were once done you would never have any more trouble of that
kind. There would be plenty of money for everything as long as you
live. It would be complete success. I don't know how to say enough to
you, or to tell you how dearly I love you, or to make you understand
how well I think you have done it all.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) caressed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) again,
and was almost beside herself in an agony of mingled anxiety and joy.
If, after all, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beautiful boy, who had lately been her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disgrace
and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) great trouble because of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) poverty, should shine forth to
the world as a baronet with #20,000 a year, how glorious would it be!
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must have known,--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did know,--how poor, how selfish a creature
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was. But her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gratification at the prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) splendour
obliterated the sorrow with which the vileness of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) character
sometimes oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Were he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to win this girl with all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
father's money, neither she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nor his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister would be the better for
it, except in this, that the burden of maintaining him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would be taken
from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders. But his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) magnificence would be established. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son, and the prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fortune and splendour was sufficient
to elate her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into a very heaven of beautiful dreams. <div class="bookquote">``But, Felix,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``you really must stay and go to the Longestaffes'
to-morrow. It will only be one day.--And now were you to run away--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Run away! What nonsense you talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were to start back to London at once I mean, it would be an
affront to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), and the very thing to set Melmotte against you. You
should lay yourself out to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>);--indeed you should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix. But nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) allowed himself to
be persuaded to remain. The matter was important even to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) consented to endure the almost unendurable nuisance of spending
another day at the Manor House. Lady Carbury, almost lost in delight,
did not know where to turn for sympathy. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin were not so
stiff, so pig-headed, so wonderfully ignorant of the affairs of
the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would have at any rate consented to rejoice with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).
Though he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might not like Felix,--who, as his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mother admitted to
herself, had been rude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) cousin,--he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would have rejoiced for the
sake of the family. But, as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did not dare to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
would have received her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) tidings with silent scorn. And even Henrietta
would not be enthusiastic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) felt that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would have
delighted to expatiate on this great triumph, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) must be silent at
present. It should now be her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) great effort to ingratiate herself with
Mr. Melmotte at the dinner party at Caversham.

<p/>During the whole of that evening Roger Carbury hardly spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
cousin Hetta. There was not much conversation between them till quite
late, when Father Barham came in for supper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had been over at
Bungay among his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) people there, and had walked back, taking Carbury on
the way. <div class="bookquote">``What did you think of our bishop?''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), rather
imprudently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much of him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) as a bishop. I don't doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) makes a very nice
lord, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) does more good among his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) neighbours than an average
lord. But you don't put power or responsibility into the hands of any
one sufficient to make him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) a bishop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine-tenths of the clergy in the diocese would be guided by him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) in
any matter of clerical conduct which might come before him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they know that he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) has no strong opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) own, and
would not therefore desire to dominate theirs. Take any of your
bishops that has an opinion,--if there be one left,--and see how far
your clergy consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) teaching!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger turned round and took up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was already becoming tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) pet priest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) himself
always abstained from saying a word derogatory to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) new friend's
religion in the man's hearing; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) new friend did not by any
means return the compliment. Perhaps also Roger felt that were he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
to take up the cudgels for an argument he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might be worsted in the
combat, as in such combats success is won by practised skill rather
than by truth. Henrietta was also reading, and Felix was smoking
elsewhere,--wondering whether the hours would ever wear themselves
away in that castle of dulness, in which no cards were to be seen,
and where, except at meal-times, there was nothing to drink. But Lady
Carbury was quite willing to allow the priest to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that all
appliances for the dissemination of religion outside his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) own church
must be naught.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose our bishops are sincere in their beliefs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sweetest smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I hope so. I have no possible reason to doubt it as to the
two or three whom I have seen,--nor indeed as to all the rest whom I
have not seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are so much respected everywhere as good and pious men!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not doubt it. Nothing tends so much to respect as a good
income. But they may be excellent men without being excellent
bishops. I find no fault with them, but much with the system by which
they are controlled. Is it probable that a man should be fitted to
select guides for other men's souls because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has succeeded by
infinite labour in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vocation in becoming the leader of a majority
in the House of Commons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, who did not in the least understand
the nature of the question put to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when you've got your bishop, is it likely that a man should be
able to do his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty in that capacity who has no power of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own to
decide whether a clergyman under him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is or is not fit for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The English people, or some of them,--that some being the richest,
and, at present, the most powerful,--like to play at having a Church,
though there is not sufficient faith in them to submit to the control
of a Church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think men should be controlled by clergymen, Mr. Barham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In matters of faith I do; and so, I suppose, do you; at least you
make that profession. You declare it to be your duty to submit
yourself to your spiritual pastors and masters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, I thought, was for children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury. ``The
clergyman, in the catechism, says, <div class="bookquote">``My good child.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is what you were taught as a child before you had made profession
of your faith to a bishop, in order that you might know your duty
when you had ceased to be a child. I quite agree, however, that
the matter, as viewed by your Church, is childish altogether, and
intended only for children. As a rule, adults with you want no
religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that is true of a great many.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is marvellous to me that, when a man thinks of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not
be driven by very fear to the comforts of a safer faith,--unless,
indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enjoy the security of absolute infidelity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is worse than anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury with a sigh and a
shudder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that it is worse than a belief which is no belief,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>said the priest with energy;--<div class="bookquote">``than a creed which sits so easily
on a man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not even know what it contains, and never
asks himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeats it, whether it be to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) credible or
incredible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're getting too deep, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, putting down the book
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had in vain been trying to read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is so pleasant to have a little serious conversation on
Sunday evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury. The priest drew himself back into
his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) chair and smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was quite clever enough to understand that
Lady Carbury had been talking nonsense, and clever enough also to be
aware of the cause of Roger's uneasiness. But Lady Carbury might be
all the easier converted because she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) understood nothing and was fond
of ambitious talking; and Roger Carbury might possibly be forced into
conviction by the very feeling which at present made him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) unwilling to
hear arguments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like hearing my Church ill-spoken of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't like me if I thought ill of it and spoke well of it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>said the priest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, therefore, the less said the sooner mended,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, rising
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) chair. Upon this Father Barham took his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) departure and walked
away to Beccles. It might be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had sowed some seed. It might be
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had, at any rate, ploughed some ground. Even the attempt to
plough the ground was a good work which would not be forgotten.

<p/>The following morning was the time on which Roger had fixed for
repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) suit to Henrietta. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had determined that it should be
so, and though the words had been almost on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tongue during that
Sunday afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had repressed them because he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
had determined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was conscious, almost painfully conscious, of
a certain increase of tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin's manner towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). All that pride of independence, which had amounted almost to
roughness, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was in London, seemed to have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) morning and night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) looked softly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
cherished the flowers which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could perceive that if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) expressed the slightest wish in any matter about the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
would attend to it. There had been a word said about punctuality,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had become punctual as the hand of the clock. There was not
a glance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) eye, nor a turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) hand, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not watch,
and calculate its effect as regarded himself. But because she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was
tender to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and observant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not by any means allow himself
to believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) heart was growing into love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thought
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) understood the working of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could see how great
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) disgust at her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) brother's doings; how fretted he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
mother's conduct. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) grace, and sweetness, and sense, took part with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) against those who were nearer to herself, and therefore,--in
pity,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). It was thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) read it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) read it
almost with exact accuracy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hetta,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said after breakfast, <div class="bookquote">``come out into the garden awhile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are not you going to the men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet, at any rate. I do not always go to the men as you call it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) hat and tripped out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), knowing well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
had been summoned to hear the old story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had been sure, as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) found the white rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) room, that the old story would be
repeated again before she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) left Carbury;--and, up to this time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
had hardly made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mind what answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would give to it. That
she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) offer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) did know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) knew well
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) loved the other man. That other man had never asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) love, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired it. But in
spite of all this there had in truth grown up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) bosom a feeling
of tenderness towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin so strong that it almost tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
to declare to herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) ought to have what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wanted, simply
because he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wanted it. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was so good, so noble, so generous, so
devoted, that it almost seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could not be justified
in refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had gone entirely over to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) side in regard
to the Melmottes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) of the charm of Mr.
Melmotte's money, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) very heart had been sickened. There was
nothing noble there; but, as contrasted with that, Roger's conduct
and bearing were those of a fine gentleman who knew neither fear
nor shame. Should such a one be doomed to pine for ever because a
girl could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),--a man born to be loved, if nobility and
tenderness and truth were lovely!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hetta,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``put your arm here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``I was a
little annoyed last night by that priest. I want to be civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>),
and now he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is always turning against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) doesn't do any harm, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) does do harm if he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) teaches you and me to think lightly of
those things which we have been brought up to revere.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div>So, thought
Henrietta, it isn't about love this time; it's only about the Church.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) ought not to say things before my guests as to our way of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)'ll do me any harm. I'm not at all that way given.
I suppose they all do it. It's their business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow! I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) here just because I thought it was a pity
that a man born and bred like a gentleman should never see the inside

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);--only I didn't like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saying stupid things about the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then there was a pause. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose your brother

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own affairs, Roger? Do you mean money? He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never says a word to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant about the Melmottes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not to me. Felix hardly ever speaks to me about anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) has accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) very nearly did accept him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't quite sympathise with your mother in all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feelings about

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Felix is so disposed to be extravagant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; yes. But I was going to say that though I cannot bring
myself to say anything to encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) about this heiress, I quite
recognise her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) unselfish devotion to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) interests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma thinks more of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) than of anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, not in the
least intending to accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother of indifference to herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it; and though I happen to think myself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) other child
would better repay her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) devotion,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, looking up to Hetta
and smiling,--<div class="bookquote">``I quite feel how good a mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) is to Felix. You

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt that there was something unpleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then Felix coming after his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) time put me out. I am getting old

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are so good,--and so kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) said this she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) leaned
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm almost as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) meant to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been angry with myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and so I am making you my

I think that you would understand me better than your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do understand you; but don't think there is any fault to confess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not exact any penance?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) only looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``I am going to put a penance on myself all the same. I can't
congratulate your brother on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wooing over at Caversham, as I know
nothing about it, but I will express some civil wish to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) about
things in general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will that be a penance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you could look into my mind you'd find that it would. I'm full of
fretful anger against him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) for half-a-dozen little frivolous things.
Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) throw his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cigar on the path? Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lie in bed on Sunday
instead of going to church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was travelling all the Saturday night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose fault was that? But don't you see it is the triviality of the
offence which makes the penance necessary. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knocked me over

a right to be angry. But I was angry because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wanted a horse on
Sunday;--and therefore I must do penance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing of love in all this. Hetta, however, did not
wish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to talk of love. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was certainly now treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) as a
friend,--as a most intimate friend. If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would only do that without
making love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), how happy could she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) be! But his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) determination
still held good. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), altering his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tone altogether, <div class="bookquote">``I
must speak about myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Immediately the weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
arm was lessened. Thereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) left hand round and pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) arm to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``do not make any change towards me

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always friends!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--always friends. And now listen to me for I have much to say.
I will not tell you again that I love you. You know it, or else you

I love you, but I am so accustomed to concern myself with one thing
only, so constrained by the habits and nature of my life to confine
myself to single interests, that I cannot as it were escape from my
love. I am thinking of it always, often despising myself because
I think of it so much. For, after all, let a woman be ever so
good,--and you to me are all that is good,--a man should not allow
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love to dominate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intellect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. I calculate my chances within my own bosom almost as a man

sure,--quite sure that you are the only possible mistress of this
house during my tenure of it. If I am ever to live as other men do,
and to care about the things which other men care for, it must be as
your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,--pray do not say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I think that I have a right to say it,--and a right to expect

you should not be pressed to make a sacrifice of yourself because
I am your friend and cousin. But I think it is quite possible you
might come to love me,--unless your heart be absolutely given away
elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We each of us know of what the other is thinking. If Paul Montague

even me, if you loved no one else.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) voice was manly,
and at the same time full of entreaty. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
were bright with love and anxiety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) not only believed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as to
the tale which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) now told her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) altogether.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was a staff on which a woman might safely lean,
trusting to it for comfort and protection in life. In that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
all but yielded to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
then, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have yielded. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did all but love him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
so regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that had it been some other woman that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) craved,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have used every art she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew to have backed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) suit, and
would have been ready to swear that any woman was a fool who refused
him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) almost hated herself because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was unkind to one who so
thoroughly deserved kindness. As it was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) no answer, but
continued to walk beside him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) trembling. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I would tell it
you all, because I wish you to know exactly the state of my mind.

bright or dark, for you to open or to shut the gates of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earthly

the bridges, and leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way into the house alone.




<p/>CHAPTER XX.

<p/>LADY POMONA``S DINNER PARTY.


<p/>Roger Carbury's half formed plan of keeping Henrietta at home while
Lady Carbury and Sir Felix went to dine at Caversham fell to the
ground. It was to be carried out only in the event of Hetta's
yielding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) prayer. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had in fact not made a prayer, and
Hetta had certainly yielded nothing. When the evening came, Lady
Carbury started with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son and daughter, and Roger was left alone.
In the ordinary course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was used to solitude. During
the greater part of the year he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would eat and drink and live without
companionship; so that there was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) nothing peculiarly sad in
this desertion. But on the present occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not prevent
himself from dwelling on the loneliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) lot in life. These
cousins of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) who were his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) guests cared nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). Lady
Carbury had come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) house simply that it might be useful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>);
Sir Felix did not pretend to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) with even ordinary courtesy;
and Hetta herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was soft to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and gracious, was soft
and gracious through pity rather than love. On this day he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had, in
truth, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) for nothing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had almost brought himself to
think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) might give all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wanted without asking. And yet,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) of the greatness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love, and of its endurance,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was simply silent. When the carriage taking them to dinner went
away down the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sat on the parapet of the bridge in front of
the house listening to the sound of the horses' feet, and telling
himself that there was nothing left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) in life.

<p/>If ever one man had been good to another, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been good to Paul
Montague, and now Paul Montague was robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of everything he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
valued in the world. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts were not logical, nor was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mind exact. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) considered it, the stronger was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inward
condemnation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never mentioned to anyone the
services he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had rendered to Montague. In speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Hetta he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had alluded only to the affection which had existed between them. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that because of those services his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend Montague had owed
it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not to fall in love with the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought
that if, unfortunately, this had happened unawares, Montague should
have retired as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not bring
himself to forgive his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, even though Hetta had assured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend had never spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) of love. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sore all over, and
it was Paul Montague who made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sore. Had there been no such man at
Carbury when Hetta came there, Hetta might now have been mistress of
the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat there till the servant came to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
dinner was on the table. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crept in and ate,--so that the man
might not see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sorrow; and, after dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat with a book in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand seeming to read. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read not a word, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was
fixed altogether on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin Hetta. <div class="bookquote">``What a poor creature a man
is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``who is not sufficiently his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own master to
get over a feeling like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At Caversham there was a very grand party,--as grand almost as a
dinner party can be in the country. There were the Earl and Countess
of Loddon and Lady Jane Pewet from Loddon Park, and the bishop
and his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) wife, and the Hepworths. These, with the Carburys and
the parson's family, and the people staying in the house, made
twenty-four at the dinner table. As there were fourteen ladies and
only ten men, the banquet can hardly be said to have been very well
arranged. But those things cannot be done in the country with the
exactness which the appliances of London make easy; and then the
Longestaffes, though they were decidedly people of fashion, were
not famous for their excellence in arranging such matters. If aught,
however, was lacking in exactness, it was made up in grandeur. There
were three powdered footmen, and in that part of the country Lady
Pomona alone was served after this fashion; and there was a very
heavy butler, whose appearance of itself was sufficient to give éclat
to a family. The grand saloon in which nobody ever lived was thrown
open, and sofas and chairs on which nobody ever sat were uncovered.
It was not above once in the year that this kind of thing was done
at Caversham; but when it was done, nothing was spared which could
contribute to the magnificence of the fête. Lady Pomona and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) two
tall daughters standing up to receive the little Countess of Loddon
and Lady Jane Pewet, who was the image of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pewet</b></font>) mother on a somewhat
smaller scale, while Madame Melmotte and Marie stood behind as though
ashamed of themselves, was a sight to see. Then the Carburys came,
and then Mrs. Yeld with the bishop. The grand room was soon fairly
full; but nobody had a word to say. The bishop was generally a man
of much conversation, and Lady Loddon, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) were well pleased
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) listeners, could talk by the hour without ceasing. But on
this occasion nobody could utter a word. Lord Loddon pottered about,
making a feeble attempt, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was seconded by no one. Lord
Alfred stood, stock-still, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) grey moustache with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) hand.
That much greater man, Augustus Melmotte, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thumbs into the
arm-holes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) waistcoat, and was impassible. The bishop saw at a
glance the hopelessness of the occasion, and made no attempt. The
master of the house shook hands with each guest as he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) entered, and
then devoted his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) mind to expectation of the next comer. Lady Pomona
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) two daughters were grand and handsome, but weary and dumb.
In accordance with the treaty, Madame Melmotte had been entertained
civilly for four entire days. It could not be expected that the
ladies of Caversham should come forth unwearied after such a
struggle.

<p/>When dinner was announced Felix was allowed to take in Marie
Melmotte. There can be no doubt but that the Caversham ladies did
execute their part of the treaty. They were led to suppose that this
arrangement would be desirable to the Melmottes, and they made it.
The great Augustus himself went in with Lady Carbury, much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
satisfaction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) also had been dumb in the drawing-room; but now,
if ever, it would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) duty to exert herself. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you like
Suffolk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, I thank you. Oh, yes;--very nice place for a little
fresh air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--that's just it, Mr. Melmotte. When the summer comes one does
long so to see the flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have better flowers in our balconies than any I see down here,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt;--because you can command the floral tribute of the world
at large. What is there that money will not do? It can turn a London
street into a bower of roses, and give you grottoes in Grosvenor
Square.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very nice place, is London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have got plenty of money, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you have not, it's the best place I know to get it. Do you
live in London, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had quite forgotten Lady Carbury even if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) house, and with the dulness of hearing common
to men, had not picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) name when told to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) out to
dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I live in London. I have had the honour of being
entertained by you there.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sweetest smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed. So many do come, that I don't always just remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should you,--with all the world flocking round you? I am Lady
Carbury, the mother of Sir Felix Carbury, whom I think you will
remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I know Sir Felix. He (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)'s sitting there, next to my daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know much about that. Young men don't get their happiness in
that way now. They've got other things to think of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) thinks so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I didn't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) sits at the same Board with you, I think, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh;--that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) business!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte, with a grim smile.

<p/>Lady Carbury was very clever as to many things, and was not
ill-informed on matters in general that were going on around her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>); but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not know much about the city, and was profoundly ignorant as
to the duties of those Directors of whom, from time to time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) saw
the names in a catalogue. <div class="bookquote">``I trust that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is diligent, there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is aware of the great privilege which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) enjoys in
having the advantage of your counsel and guidance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) don't trouble me much, ma'am, and I don't trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>After this Lady Carbury said no more as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son's position in the
city. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) endeavoured to open various other subjects of conversation;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found Mr. Melmotte to be heavy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hands. After a while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had to abandon him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) in despair, and give herself up to raptures in
favour of Protestantism at the bidding of the Caversham parson, who
sat on the other side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), and who had been worked to enthusiasm
by some mention of Father Barham's name.

<p/>Opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), or nearly so, sat Sir Felix and his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) love. <div class="bookquote">``I
have told mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie had whispered, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) walked in to dinner
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was now full of the idea so common to girls who are
engaged,--and as natural as it is common,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) might tell
everything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) say anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) asked. Then Marie had to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) place
and arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) dress before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could reply to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), I
suppose it does not matter what she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) says, does it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said a great deal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thinks that papa will think you are not
rich enough. Hush! Talk about something else, or people will hear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So much she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been able to say during the bustle.

<p/>Felix was not at all anxious to talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) love, and changed the
subject very willingly. <div class="bookquote">``Have you been riding?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I don't think there are horses here,--not for visitors, that is.
How did you get home? Did you have any adventures?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix, remembering Ruby Ruggles. <div class="bookquote">``I just rode
home quietly. I go to town to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And we go on Wednesday. Mind you come and see us before long.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) voice down to a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall. I suppose I'd better go to your father in the
city. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go every day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s back always about seven. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s
good-natured enough when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes back, but sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s very
cross. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s best just after dinner. But it's so hard to get to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
then. Lord Alfred is almost always there; and then other people come,
and they play cards. I think the city will be best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll stick to it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes;--indeed I will. Now that I've once said it nothing will
ever turn me. I think papa knows that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Felix looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said this, and thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) saw more in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) countenance
than he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had ever read there before. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would consent to
run away with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>); and, if so, being the only child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would
certainly,--almost certainly,--be forgiven. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were to
run away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) and marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), and then find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) were not
forgiven, and that Melmotte allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to starve without a shilling
of fortune, where would he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) be then? Looking at the matter in all its
bearings, considering among other things the trouble and the expense
of such a measure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could not afford to run away
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).

<p/>After dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hardly spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>); indeed, the room itself,--the
same big room in which they had been assembled before the
feast,--seemed to be ill-adapted for conversation. Again nobody
talked to anybody, and the minutes went very heavily till at last the
carriages were there to take them all home. <div class="bookquote">``They arranged that you
should sit next to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son, as they were
in the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I suppose that came naturally;--one young man and one young
woman, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those things are always arranged, and they would not have done it
unless they had thought that it would please Mr. Melmotte. Oh, Felix!
if you can bring it about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall if I can, mother; you needn't make a fuss about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't. You cannot wonder that I should be anxious. You behaved
beautifully to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at dinner; I was so happy to see you together.
Good night, Felix, and God bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said again, as they were
parting for the night. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be the happiest and the proudest
mother in England if this comes about.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXI.

<p/>EVERYBODY GOES TO THEM.


<p/>When the Melmottes went from Caversham the house was very desolate.
The task of entertaining these people was indeed over, and had the
return to London been fixed for a certain near day, there would have
been comfort at any rate among the ladies of the family. But this
was so far from being the case that the Thursday and Friday passed
without anything being settled, and dreadful fears began to fill
the minds of Lady Pomona and Sophia Longestaffe. Georgiana was also
impatient, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) asserted boldly that treachery, such as that which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother and sister contemplated, was impossible. Their father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
thought, would not dare to propose it. On each of these days,--three
or four times daily,--hints were given and questions were asked, but
without avail. Mr. Longestaffe would not consent to have a day fixed
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had received some particular letter, and would not even
listen to the suggestion of a day. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose we can go at any rate
on Tuesday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Georgiana said on the Friday evening. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know why
you should suppose anything of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>the father replied. Poor
Lady Pomona was urged by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) daughters to compel him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to name a day;
but Lady Pomona was less audacious in urging the request than her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
younger child, and at the same time less anxious for its completion.
On the Sunday morning before they went to church there was a great
discussion up-stairs. The Bishop of Elmham was going to preach
at Caversham church, and the three ladies were dressed in their
best London bonnets. They were in their mother's room, having just
completed the arrangements of their church-going toilet. It was
supposed that the expected letter had arrived. Mr. Longestaffe had
certainly received a dispatch from his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) lawyer, but had not as yet
vouchsafed any reference to its contents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been more than
ordinarily silent at breakfast, and,--so Sophia asserted,--more
disagreeable than ever. The question had now arisen especially in
reference to their bonnets. <div class="bookquote">``You might as well wear them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Pomona, <div class="bookquote">``for I am sure you will not be in London again this year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean it, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, my dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked like it when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) put those papers back into
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pocket. I know what his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face means so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) promised, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) got us to
have those horrid people because he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) promised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, if your father says that we can't go back, I suppose
we must take his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) word for it. It is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must decide of course. What he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
meant I suppose was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would take us back if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>shouted Georgiana. Was there to be treachery not only on the
part of their natural adversary, who, adversary though he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) was, had
bound himself to terms by a treaty, but treachery also in their own
camp!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, what can we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Georgiana was now going to speak out plainly. <div class="bookquote">``Make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
understand that we are not going to be sat upon like that. I'll do
something, if that's going to be the way of it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) treats me like
that I'll run off with the first man that will take me, let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) be
who it may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk like that, Georgiana, unless you wish to kill me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll break his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does not care about us,--not the
least,--whether we are happy or miserable; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cares very much
about the family name. I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that I'm not going to be a
slave. I'll marry a London tradesman before I'll stay down here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>The
younger Miss Longestaffe was lost in passion at the prospect before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Georgey, don't say such horrid things as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>pleaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well for you, Sophy. You've got George Whitstable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't got George Whitstable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have, and your fish is fried. Dolly does just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>)
pleases, and spends money as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) likes. Of course it makes no
difference to you, mamma, where you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very unjust,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona, wailing, <div class="bookquote">``and you say horrid
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ain't unjust at all. It doesn't matter to you. And Sophy is the
same as settled. But I'm to be sacrificed! How am I to see anybody
down here in this horrid hole? Papa promised and he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) must keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)
word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then there came to them a loud voice calling to them from the hall.
<div class="bookquote">``Are any of you coming to church, or are you going to keep the
carriage waiting all day?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Of course they were all going to church.
They always did go to church when they were at Caversham; and would
more especially do so to-day, because of the bishop and because of
the bonnets. They trooped down into the hall and into the carriage,
Lady Pomona leading the way. Georgiana stalked along, passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
father at the front door without condescending to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Not
a word was spoken on the way to church, or on the way home. During
the service Mr. Longestaffe stood up in the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) pew, and
repeated the responses in a loud voice. In performing this duty he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
had been an example to the parish all his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) life. The three ladies
knelt on their hassocks in the most becoming fashion, and sat during
the sermon without the slightest sign either of weariness or of
attention. They did not collect the meaning of any one combination of
sentences. It was nothing to them whether the bishop had or had not
a meaning. Endurance of that kind was their strength. Had the bishop
preached for forty-five minutes instead of half an hour they would
not have complained. It was the same kind of endurance which enabled
Georgiana to go on from year to year waiting for a husband of the
proper sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could put up with any amount of tedium if only the
fair chance of obtaining ultimate relief were not denied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>). But
to be kept at Caversham all the summer would be as bad as hearing a
bishop preach for ever! After the service they came back to lunch,
and that meal also was eaten in silence. When it was over the head
of the family put himself into the dining-room arm-chair, evidently
meaning to be left alone there. In that case he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) would have meditated
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) troubles till he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) went to sleep, and would have thus got
through the afternoon with comfort. But this was denied to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>). The
two daughters remained steadfast while the things were being removed;
and Lady Pomona, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) made one attempt to leave the room,
returned when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) found that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) daughters would not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).
Georgiana had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) meant to <div class="bookquote">``have it out''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father, and Sophia had of course remained in the room
in obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sister's behest. When the last tray had been
taken out, Georgiana began. <div class="bookquote">``Papa, don't you think you could settle
now when we are to go back to town? Of course we want to know
about engagements and all that. There is Lady Monogram's party on
Wednesday. We promised to be there ever so long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better write to Lady Monogram and say you can't keep your
engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not, papa? We could go up on Wednesday morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't do anything of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear, we should all like to have a day fixed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Pomona. Then there was a pause. Even Georgiana, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) present state
of mind, would have accepted some distant, even some undefined time,
as a compromise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you can't have a day fixed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long do you suppose that we shall be kept here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, in
a low constrained voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what you mean by being kept here. This is your home,
and this is where you may make up your minds to live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we are to go back?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>demanded Sophia. Georgiana stood by in
silence, listening, resolving, and biding her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll not return to London this season,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe,
turning himself abruptly to a newspaper which he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that that is settled?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean to say that that is settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe.

<p/>Was there ever treachery like this! The indignation in Georgiana's
mind approached almost to virtue as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father's
falseness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) would not have left town at all but for that promise.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) would not have contaminated herself with the Melmottes but
for that promise. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was told that the promise was to be
absolutely broken, when it was no longer possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could get
back to London,--even to the house of the hated Primeros,--without
absolutely running away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father's residence! <div class="bookquote">``Then, papa,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) said, with affected calmness, <div class="bookquote">``you have simply and with
premeditation broken your word to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you speak to me in that way, you wicked child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not a child, papa, as you know very well. I am my own
mistress,--by law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then go and be your own mistress. You dare to tell me, your father,
that I have premeditated a falsehood! If you tell me that again, you
shall eat your meals in your own room or not eat them in this house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you not promise that we should go back if we would come down and
entertain these people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not argue with a child, insolent and disobedient as you are.
If I have anything to say about it, I will say it to your mother. It
should be enough for you that I, your father, tell you that you have
to live here. Now go away, and if you choose to be sullen, go and be
sullen where I shan't see you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Georgiana looked round on her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother
and sister and then marched majestically out of the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) still
meditated revenge, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was partly cowed, and did not dare in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
father's presence to go on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) reproaches. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) stalked off into
the room in which they generally lived, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) stood panting
with anger, breathing indignation through her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) nostrils.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) marched majestically out of the room.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you mean to put up with it, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can we do, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do something. I'm not going to be cheated and swindled and
have my life thrown away into the bargain. I have always behaved
well to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I have never run up bills without saying anything about
them.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>This was a cut at her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) elder sister, who had once got into some
little trouble of that kind. <div class="bookquote">``I have never got myself talked about
with any body. If there is anything to be done I always do it. I have
written his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) letters for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) till I have been sick, and when you were
ill I never asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to stay out with us after two or half-past two
at the latest. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tells me that I am to eat my meals up in my
bedroom because I remind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) distinctly promised to take us
back to London! Did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not promise, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understood so, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) promised, mamma. If I do anything now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must bear the
blame of it. I am not going to keep myself straight for the sake of
the family, and then be treated in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do that for your own sake, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is more than you've been able to do for anybody's sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said
Georgiana, alluding to a very old affair,--to an ancient flirtation,
in the course of which the elder daughter had made a foolish and a
futile attempt to run away with an officer of dragoons whose private
fortune was very moderate. Ten years had passed since that, and the
affair was never alluded to except in moments of great bitterness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've kept myself as straight as you have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia. <div class="bookquote">``It's easy
enough to be straight, when a person never cares for anybody, and
nobody cares for a person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dears, if you quarrel what am I to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said their mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I that have to suffer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>continued Georgiana. <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) expect
me to find anybody here that I could take? Poor George Whitstable is
not much; but there is nobody else at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may have him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, with a chuck of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my dear, but I shouldn't like it at all. I haven't come
to that quite yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were talking of running away with somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't run away with George Whitstable; you may be sure of that.
I'll tell you what I shall do,--I will write papa a letter. I suppose
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll condescend to read it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) won't take me up to town himself,
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must send me up to the Primeros. What makes me most angry in the
whole thing is that we should have condescended to be civil to the
Melmottes down in the country. In London one does those things, but
to have them here was terrible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>During that entire afternoon nothing more was said. Not a word passed
between them on any subject beyond those required by the necessities
of life. Georgiana had been as hard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father,
and Sophia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) quiet way resented the affront. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was now almost
reconciled to the sojourn in the country, because it inflicted a
fitting punishment on Georgiana, and the presence of Mr. Whitstable
at a distance of not more than ten miles did of course make a
difference to herself. Lady Pomona complained of a headache, which
was always an excuse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) for not speaking;--and Mr. Longestaffe
went to sleep. Georgiana during the whole afternoon remained apart,
and on the next morning the head of the family found the following
letter on his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) dressing-table;--


<p/>MY DEAR PAPA,--

<p/>I don't think you ought to be surprised because we feel
that our going up to town is so very important to us. If
we are not to be in London at this time of the year we can
never see anybody, and of course you know what that must
mean for me. If this goes on about Sophia, it does not
signify for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and, though mamma likes London, it is not
of real importance. But it is very, very hard upon me. It
isn't for pleasure that I want to go up. There isn't so
very much pleasure in it. But if I'm to be buried down
here at Caversham, I might just as well be dead at once.
If you choose to give up both houses for a year, or for
two years, and take us all abroad, I should not grumble in
the least. There are very nice people to be met abroad,
and perhaps things go easier that way than in town. And
there would be nothing for horses, and we could dress very
cheap and wear our old things. I'm sure I don't want to
run up bills. But if you would only think what Caversham
must be to me, without any one worth thinking about within
twenty miles, you would hardly ask me to stay here.

<p/>You certainly did say that if we would come down here with
those Melmottes we should be taken back to town, and you
cannot be surprised that we should be disappointed when we
are told that we are to be kept here after that. It makes
me feel that life is so hard that I can't bear it. I see
other girls having such chances when I have none, that
sometimes I think I don't know what will happen to me.

<p/>This was the nearest approach which she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) dared to make in writing to
that threat which she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had uttered to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mother of running away with
somebody.

<p/>I suppose that now it is useless for me to ask you to take
us all back this summer,--though it was promised; but I
hope you'll give me money to go up to the Primeros. It
would only be me and my maid. Julia Primero asked me to
stay with them when you first talked of not going up, and
I should not in the least object to reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), only
it should be done at once. Their house in Queen's Gate is
very large, and I know they've a room. They all ride, and
I should want a horse; but there would be nothing else,
as they have plenty of carriages, and the groom who rides
with Julia would do for both of us. Pray answer this at
once, papa.

<p/>Your affectionate daughter,

<p/>GEORGIANA LONGESTAFFE.


<p/>Mr. Longestaffe did condescend to read the letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
had rebuked his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mutinous daughter with stern severity, was also to
some extent afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). At a sudden burst he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) could stand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
authority, and assume his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) position with parental dignity; but not the
less did he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) dread the wearing toil of continued domestic strife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
thought that upon the whole his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) daughter liked a row in the house. If
not, there surely would not be so many rows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) himself thoroughly
hated them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had not any very lively interest in life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) did not
read much; he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) did not talk much; he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was not specially fond of eating
and drinking; he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) did not gamble, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) did not care for the farm. To
stand about the door and hall and public rooms of the clubs to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) belonged and hear other men talk politics or scandal, was what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) liked better than anything else in the world. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was quite
willing to give this up for the good of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would be
contented to drag through long listless days at Caversham, and
endeavour to nurse his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) property, if only his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) daughter would allow it.
By assuming a certain pomp in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) living, which had been altogether
unserviceable to himself and family, by besmearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) footmen's
heads, and bewigging his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) coachmen, by aping, though never achieving,
the grand ways of grander men than himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had run himself into
debt. His (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own ambition had been a peerage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had thought that
this was the way to get it. A separate property had come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) wife's mother,--some #2,000 or #3,000 a year, magnified by
the world into double its amount,--and the knowledge of this had
for a time reconciled him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) to increasing the burdens on the family
estates. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been sure that Adolphus, when of age, would have
consented to sell the Sussex property in order that the Suffolk
property might be relieved. But Dolly was now in debt himself, and
though in other respects the most careless of men, was always on his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
guard in any dealings with his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would not consent to the
sale of the Sussex property unless half of the proceeds were to be at
once handed to himself. The father could not bring himself to consent
to this, but, while refusing it, found the troubles of the world
very hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Melmotte had done something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--but in
doing this Melmotte was very hard and tyrannical. Melmotte, when at
Caversham, had looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) affairs, and had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) very plainly
that with such an establishment in the country he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not entitled
to keep a house in town. Mr. Longestaffe had then said something
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) daughters,--something especially about Georgiana,--and Mr.
Melmotte had made a suggestion.

<p/>Mr. Longestaffe, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) daughter's appeal, did feel for
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) anger. But if there was one man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated more
than another, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour Mr. Primero; and if one woman, it
was Mrs. Primero. Primero, whom Mr. Longestaffe regarded as quite
an upstart, and anything but a gentleman, owed no man anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) tradesmen punctually, and never met the squire of Caversham
without seeming to make a parade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) virtue in that direction.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had spent many thousands for his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) party in county elections and
borough elections, and was now himself member for a metropolitan
district. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was a radical, of course, or, according to Mr.
Longestaffe's view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) political conduct, acted and voted on the
radical side because there was nothing to be got by voting and acting
on the other. And now there had come into Suffolk a rumour that Mr.
Primero was to have a peerage. To others the rumour was incredible,
but Mr. Longestaffe believed it, and to Mr. Longestaffe that belief
was an agony. A Baron Bundlesham just at his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) door, and such a Baron
Bundlesham, would be more than Mr. Longestaffe could endure. It was
quite impossible that his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) daughter should be entertained in London by
the Primeros.

<p/>But another suggestion had been made. Georgiana's letter had been
laid on her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father's table on the Monday morning. On the following
morning, when there could have been no intercourse with London by
letter, Lady Pomona called her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) younger daughter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>), and handed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) a note to read. <div class="bookquote">``Your papa has this moment given it me. Of course
you must judge for yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was the note;--


<p/>MY DEAR MR. LONGESTAFFE,

<p/>As you seem determined not to return to London this
season, perhaps one of your young ladies would like to
come to us. Mrs. Melmotte would be delighted to have Miss
Georgiana for June and July. If so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) need only give
Mrs. Melmotte a day's notice.

<p/>Yours truly,

<p/>AUGUSTUS MELMOTTE.


<p/>Georgiana, as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) eye had glanced down the one side of note
paper on which this invitation was written, looked up for the date.
It was without a date, and had, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) felt sure, been left in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
father's hands to be used as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might think fit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) breathed very
hard. Both her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father and mother had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) speak of these
Melmottes, and knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) thought of them. There was an insolence
in the very suggestion. But at the first moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) said nothing of
that. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I go to the Primeros?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father will not hear of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dislikes them especially.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I dislike the Melmottes. I dislike the Primeros of course, but
they are not so bad as the Melmottes. That would be dreadful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must judge for yourself, Georgiana.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is that,--or staying here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If papa chooses I don't know why I am to mind. It will be awfully
disagreeable,--absolutely disgusting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) seemed to be very quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, mamma! Quiet! She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was quiet here because she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was afraid of us.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) isn't yet used to be with people like us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)'ll get over that
if I'm in the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>). And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) is, oh! so frightfully
vulgar! She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) must have been the very sweeping of the gutters. Did
you not see it, mamma? She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could not even open her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mouth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was
so ashamed of herself. I shouldn't wonder if they turned out to be
something quite horrid. They make me shudder. Was there ever anything
so dreadful to look at as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody goes to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona. <div class="bookquote">``The Duchess of Stevenage
has been there over and over again, and so has Lady Auld Reekie.
Everybody goes to their house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But everybody doesn't go and live with them. Oh, mamma,--to have to
sit down to breakfast every day for ten weeks with that man and that
woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they'll let you have your breakfast up-stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to have to go out with them;--walking into the room after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!
Only think of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are so anxious to be in London, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I am anxious. What other chance have I, mamma? And, oh
dear, I am so tired of it! Pleasure, indeed! Papa talks of pleasure.
If papa had to work half as hard as I do, I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'d think
of it. I suppose I must do it. I know it will make me so ill that I
shall almost die under it. Horrid, horrid people! And papa to propose
it, who has always been so proud of everything,--who used to think so
much of being with the right set.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things are changed, Georgiana,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the anxious mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed they are when papa wants me to go and stay with people like
that. Why, mamma, the apothecary in Bungay is a fine gentleman
compared with Mr. Melmotte, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife is a fine lady compared with
Madame Melmotte. But I'll go. If papa chooses me to be seen with such
people it is not my fault. There will be no disgracing one's self
after that. I don't believe in the least that any decent man would
propose to a girl in such a house, and you and papa must not be
surprised if I take some horrid creature from the Stock Exchange.
Papa has altered his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) ideas; and so, I suppose, I had better alter
mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>Georgiana did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father that night, but Lady Pomona
informed Mr. Longestaffe that Mr. Melmotte's invitation was to be
accepted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) herself would write a line to Madame Melmotte, and
Georgiana would go up on the Friday following. <div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll like
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe. The poor man had no intention of irony. It
was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) nature to be severe after that fashion. But to poor
Lady Pomona the words sounded very cruel. How could any one like to
live in a house with Mr. and Madame Melmotte!

<p/>On the Friday morning there was a little conversation between the two
sisters, just before Georgiana's departure to the railway station,
which was almost touching. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had endeavoured to hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) head as
usual, but had failed. The thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was going to do cowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
even in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``Sophy, I do so envy you staying
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was you who were so determined to be in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I was determined, and am determined. I've got to get myself
settled somehow, and that can't be done down here. But you are not
going to disgrace yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no disgrace in it, Georgey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is. I believe the man to be a swindler and a thief; and
I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to be anything low that you can think of. As to their
pretensions to be gentlefolk, it is monstrous. The footmen and
housemaids would be much better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't go, Georgey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go. It's the only chance that is left. If I were to remain
down here everybody would say that I was on the shelf. You are going
to marry Whitstable, and you'll do very well. It isn't a big place,
but there's no debt on it, and Whitstable himself isn't a bad sort of
fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>), now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) hasn't much to say for himself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>)'s always at
home. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) is a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) certainly is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As for me I shall give over caring about gentlemen now. The first
man that comes to me with four or five thousand a year, I'll take
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d come out of Newgate or Bedlam. And I shall always
say it has been papa's doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>And so Georgiana Longestaffe went up to London and stayed with the
Melmottes.




<p/>CHAPTER XXII.

<p/>LORD NIDDERDALE``S MORALITY.


<p/>It was very generally said in the city about this time that the Great
South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway was the very best thing
out. It was known that Mr. Melmotte had gone into it with heart and
hand. There were many who declared,--with gross injustice to the
Great Fisker,--that the railway was Melmotte's own child, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
invented it, advertised it, agitated it, and floated it; but it was
not the less popular on that account. A railway from Salt Lake City
to Mexico no doubt had much of the flavour of a castle in Spain.
Our far-western American brethren are supposed to be imaginative.
Mexico has not a reputation among us for commercial security, or
that stability which produces its four, five, or six per cent. with
the regularity of clockwork. But there was the Panama railway, a
small affair which had paid twenty-five per cent.; and there was the
great line across the continent to San Francisco, in which enormous
fortunes had been made. It came to be believed that men with their
eyes open might do as well with the Great South Central as had ever
been done before with other speculations, and this belief was no
doubt founded on Mr. Melmotte's partiality for the enterprise. Mr.
Fisker had <div class="bookquote">``struck `ile''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fisker/MR. FISKER</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>NIDDERDALE</b></font>) induced his (<font color='blue'><b>NIDDERDALE</b></font>) partner, Montague, to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>NIDDERDALE</b></font>) a note to the great man.

<p/>Paul Montague himself, who cannot be said to have been a man having
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes open, in the city sense of the word, could not learn how
the thing was progressing. At the regular meetings of the Board,
which never sat for above half an hour, two or three papers were read
by Miles Grendall. Melmotte himself would speak a few slow words,
intended to be cheery, and always indicative of triumph, and then
everybody would agree to everything, somebody would sign something,
and the <div class="bookquote">``Board''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>for that day would be over. To Paul Montague this was
very unsatisfactory. More than once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) endeavoured to stay
the proceedings, not as disapproving, but <div class="bookquote">``simply as desirous of
being made to understand;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but the silent scorn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) chairman put
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) out of countenance, and the opposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) colleagues was
a barrier which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not strong enough to overcome. Lord Alfred
Grendall would declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``did not think all that was at all
necessary.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lord Nidderdale, with whom Montague had now become
intimate at the Beargarden, would nudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) in the ribs and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) tongue. Mr. Cohenlupe would make a little speech in fluent
but broken English, assuring the Committee that everything was being
done after the approved city fashion. Sir Felix, after the first two
meetings, was never there. And thus Paul Montague, with a sorely
burdened conscience, was carried along as one of the Directors of the
Great South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway Company.

<p/>I do not know whether the burden was made lighter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) or heavier,
by the fact that the immediate pecuniary result was certainly very
comfortable. The Company had not yet been in existence quite six
weeks,--or at any rate Melmotte had not been connected with it above
that time,--and it had already been suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) twice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
should sell fifty shares at #112 10_s_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not even yet know how
many shares he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) possessed, but on both occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) consented to the
proposal, and on the following day received a cheque for #625,--that
sum representing the profit over and above the original nominal price
of #100 a share. The suggestion was made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) by Miles Grendall,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) asked some questions as to the manner in which the shares
had been allocated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was told that all that would be arranged in
accordance with the capital invested and must depend on the final
disposition of the Californian property. <div class="bookquote">``But from what we see, old
fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you have anything to fear. You
seem to be about the best in of them all. Melmotte wouldn't advise
you to sell out gradually, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) didn't look upon the thing as a
certain income as far as you are concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul Montague understood nothing of all this, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was
standing on ground which might be blown from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) feet at any
moment. The uncertainty, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) feared might be the dishonesty,
of the whole thing, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) often very miserable. In those wretched
moments his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) conscience was asserting itself. But again there were
times in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) also was almost triumphant, and in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) felt
the delight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wealth. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was snubbed at the Board when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wanted explanations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) received very great attention outside the
board-room from those connected with the enterprise. Melmotte had
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to dine two or three times. Mr. Cohenlupe had begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) to
go down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) little place at Rickmansworth,--an entreaty with which
Montague had not as yet complied. Lord Alfred was always gracious to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), and Nidderdale and Carbury were evidently anxious to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
one of their set at the club. Many other houses became open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
from the same source. Though Melmotte was supposed to be the inventor
of the railway, it was known that Fisker, Montague, and Montague were
largely concerned in it, and it was known also that Paul Montague was
one of the Montagues named in that firm. People, both in the City and
the West End, seemed to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) knew all about it, and treated
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) as though some of the manna falling from that heaven were at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
disposition. There were results from this which were not unpleasing
to the young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only partially resisted the temptation; and
though determined at times to probe the affair to the bottom, was so
determined only at times. The money was very pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The
period would now soon arrive before which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understood himself to be
pledged not to make a distinct offer to Henrietta Carbury; and when
that period should have been passed, it would be delightful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was possessed of property sufficient to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
give a wife a comfortable home. In all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aspirations, and in all
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fears, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was true to Hetta Carbury, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the centre of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hopes. Nevertheless, had Hetta known everything, it may be feared
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have at any rate endeavoured to dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
heart.

<p/>There was considerable uneasiness in the bosoms of others of the
Directors, and a disposition to complain against the Grand Director,
arising from a grievance altogether different from that which
afflicted Montague. Neither had Sir Felix Carbury nor Lord Nidderdale
been invited to sell shares, and consequently neither of them
had received any remuneration for the use of their names. They
knew well that Montague had sold shares. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was quite open on the
subject, and had told Felix, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) hoped some day to regard
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) brother-in-law, exactly what shares he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had sold, and for
how much;--and the two men had endeavoured to make the matter
intelligible between themselves. The original price of the shares
being #100 each, and #12 10_s._ a share having been paid to Montague
as the premium, it was to be supposed that the original capital was
re-invested in other shares. But each owned to the other that the
matter was very complicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), and Montague could only write
to Hamilton K. Fisker at San Francisco asking for explanation. As
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had received no answer. But it was not the wealth flowing
into Montague's hands which embittered Nidderdale and Carbury. They
understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had really brought money into the concern, and was
therefore entitled to take money out of it. Nor did it occur to them
to grudge Melmotte his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) more noble pickings, for they knew how great
a man was Melmotte. Of Cohenlupe's doings they heard nothing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)
was a regular city man, and had probably supplied funds. Cohenlupe
was too deep for their inquiry. But they knew that Lord Alfred had
sold shares, and had received the profit; and they knew also how
utterly impossible it was that Lord Alfred should have produced
capital. If Lord Alfred Grendall was entitled to plunder, why were
not they? And if their day for plunder had not yet come, why had
Lord Alfred's? And if there was so much cause to fear Lord Alfred
that it was necessary to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) a bone, why should not they
also make themselves feared? Lord Alfred passed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) time with
Melmotte,--had, as these young men said, become Melmotte's head
valet,--and therefore had to be paid. But that reason did not satisfy
the young men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't sold any shares;--have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>This question Sir Felix
asked Lord Nidderdale at the club. Nidderdale was constant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
attendance at the Board, and Felix was not a little afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
might be jockied also by him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a share.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor got any profits?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a shilling of any kind. As far as money is concerned my only
transaction has been my part of the expense of Fisker's dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you get then, by going into the city?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm blessed if I know what I get. I suppose something will turn up
some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the meantime, you know, there are our names. And Grendall is
making a fortune out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor old duffer,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) lordship. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)'s doing so well, I think
Miles ought to be made to pay up something of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) owes. I think
we ought to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) that we shall expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) to have the money ready
when that bill of Vossner's comes round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, by George; let's tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that. Will you do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that it will be the least good. It would be quite unnatural to
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to pay anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fellows used to pay their gambling debts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, who was
still in funds, and who still held a considerable assortment of I. O.
U.``s.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't now,--unless they like it. How did a fellow manage
before, if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hadn't got it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I. O. U.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went smash,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, <div class="bookquote">``and disappeared and was never heard
of any more. It was just the same as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'d been found cheating. I
believe a fellow might cheat now and nobody'd say anything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``What's the use of being beastly
ill-natured? I'm not very good at saying my prayers, but I do think
there's something in that bit about forgiving people. Of course
cheating isn't very nice: and it isn't very nice for a fellow to play
when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) can't pay; but I don't know that it's worse than
getting drunk like Dolly Longestaffe, or quarrelling with everybody
as Grasslough does,--or trying to marry some poor devil of a girl
merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s got money. I believe in living in glass houses,
but I don't believe in throwing stones. Do you ever read the Bible,
Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Read the Bible! Well;--yes;--no;--that is, I suppose, I used to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I often think I shouldn't have been the first to pick up a stone and
pitch it at that woman. Live and let live;--that's my motto.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you agree that we ought to do something about these shares?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, thinking that this doctrine of forgiveness might be
carried too far.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly. I'll let old Grendall live with all my heart; but
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) ought to let me live too. Only, who's to bell the cat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What cat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good our going to old Grendall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale, who
had some understanding in the matter, <div class="bookquote">``nor yet to young Grendall. The
one would only grunt and say nothing, and the other would tell every
lie that came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) head. The cat in this matter I take to be our
great master, Augustus Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/>This little meeting occurred on the day after Felix Carbury's return
from Suffolk, and at a time at which, as we know, it was the great
duty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) life to get the consent of old Melmotte to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) marriage
with Marie Melmotte. In doing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have to put one bell on
the cat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that for the present that was sufficient. In
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) heart of hearts he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was afraid of Melmotte. But then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew
very well, Nidderdale was intent on the same object. Nidderdale, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
thought, was a very queer fellow. That talking about the Bible, and
the forgiving of trespasses, was very queer; and that allusion to
the marrying of heiresses very queer indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) knew that Nidderdale
wanted to marry the heiress, and Nidderdale must also know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
wanted to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>). And yet Nidderdale was indelicate enough to talk
about it! And now the man asked who should bell the cat! <div class="bookquote">``You go
there oftener than I do, and perhaps you could do it best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir
Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Board.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're always at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'d be civil to me, perhaps,
because I'm a lord: but then, for the same reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'d think I was
the bigger fool of the two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ain't afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), if you mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>continued Lord Nidderdale.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'s a wretched old reprobate, and I don't doubt but he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'d skin you
and me if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) could make money off our carcasses. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) can't skin
me, I'll have a shy at him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). On the whole I think he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) rather likes me,
because I've always been on the square with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). If it depended on
him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), you know, I should have the girl to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix did not at all mean to doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) friend's
assertion, but felt it hard to answer so very strange a statement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) don't want me, and I ain't quite sure that I want her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
Where the devil would a fellow find himself if the money wasn't all
there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Lord Nidderdale then sauntered away, leaving the baronet in a
deep study of thought as to such a condition of things as that which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) lordship had suggested. Where the--mischief would he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), Sir Felix
Carbury, be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) were to marry the girl, and then to find that the
money was not all there?

<p/>On the following Friday, which was the Board day, Nidderdale went to
the great man's offices in Abchurch Lane, and so contrived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
walked with the great man to the Board meeting. Melmotte was always
very gracious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) manner to Lord Nidderdale, but had never, up
to this moment, had any speech with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) proposed son-in-law about
business. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted just to ask you something,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>said the lord,
hanging on the chairman's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything you please, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think that Carbury and I ought to have some shares to
sell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,--if you ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh;--I didn't know. But why shouldn't we as well as the others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you and Sir Felix put any money into it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you come to that, I don't suppose we have. How much has
Lord Alfred put into it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_I_ have taken shares for Lord Alfred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, putting very
heavy emphasis on the personal pronoun. <div class="bookquote">``If it suits me to advance
money to Lord Alfred Grendall, I suppose I may do so without asking
your lordship's consent, or that of Sir Felix Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly. I don't want to make inquiry as to what you do with
your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you don't, and, therefore, we won't say anything more about
it. You wait awhile, Lord Nidderdale, and you'll find it will come
all right. If you've got a few thousand pounds loose, and will put
them into the concern, why, of course you can sell; and, if the
shares are up, can sell at a profit. It's presumed just at present
that, at some early day, you'll qualify for your directorship by
doing so, and till that is done, the shares are allocated to you, but
cannot be transferred to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale, pretending to understand
all about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If things go on as we hope they will between you and Marie, you can
have pretty nearly any number of shares that you please;--that is, if
your father consents to a proper settlement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it'll all go smooth, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you;
I'm ever so much obliged to you, and I'll explain it all to Carbury.''




 (<font color='red'><b>XXIII</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YES;--I'M A BARONET.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>How eager Lady Carbury was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son should at once go in form to
Marie's father and make his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) proposition may be easily understood.
<div class="bookquote">``My dear Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, standing over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bedside a little before
noon, <div class="bookquote">``pray don't put it off; you don't know how many slips there may
be between the cup and the lip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's everything to get him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) in a good humour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>pleaded Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the young lady will feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is ill-used.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no fear of that; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s all right. What am I to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)
about money? That's the question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think of dictating anything, Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nidderdale, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) was on before, stipulated for a certain sum
down; or his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) father did for him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). So much cash was to be paid over
before the ceremony, and it only went off because Nidderdale wanted
the money to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) liked with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't mind having it settled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I'd consent to that on condition that the money was paid
down, and the income insured to me,--say #7,000 or #8,000 a year.
I wouldn't do it for less, mother; it wouldn't be worth while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have nothing left of your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a throat that I can cut, and brains that I can blow
out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son, using an argument which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) conceived might be
efficacious with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother; though, had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) known him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might
have been sure that no man lived less likely to cut his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own throat or
blow out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own brains.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix! how brutal it is to speak to me in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be brutal; but you know, mother, business is business. You
want me to marry this girl because of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm quite a philosopher about it. I want her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money; and when one
wants money, one should make up one's mind how much or how little one
means to take,--and whether one is sure to get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think there can be any doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and if the money wasn't there, it would be
very like cutting my throat then, mother. If a man plays and loses,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can play again and perhaps win; but when a fellow goes in for
an heiress, and gets the wife without the money, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) feels a little
hampered you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d pay the money first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very well to say that. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ought; but it would be
rather awkward to refuse to go into church after everything had been
arranged because the money hadn't been paid over. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s so clever,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d contrive that a man shouldn't know whether the money had
been paid or not. You can't carry #10,000 a year about in your
pocket, you know. If you'll go, mother, perhaps I might think of
getting up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Carbury saw the danger, and turned over the affair on every side
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own mind. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could also see the house in Grosvenor
Square, the expenditure without limit, the congregating duchesses,
the general acceptation of the people, and the mercantile celebrity
of the man. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could weigh against that the absolute
pennilessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) baronet-son. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition was
hopeless. Such a one must surely run some risk. The embarrassments
of such a man as Lord Nidderdale were only temporary. There were the
family estates, and the marquisate, and a golden future for him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>); but
there was nothing coming to Felix in the future. All the goods he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
would ever have of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had now;--position, a title, and a
handsome face. Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) could afford to risk something! Even the
ruins and wreck of such wealth as that displayed in Grosvenor Square
would be better than the baronet's present condition. And then,
though it was possible that old Melmotte should be ruined some day,
there could be no doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) present means; and would it not be
probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would make hay while the sun shone by securing his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
daughter's position? She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) visited her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) son again on the next morning,
which was Sunday, and again tried to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to the marriage. <div class="bookquote">``I
think you should be content to run a little risk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said.

<p/>Sir Felix had been unlucky at cards on Saturday night, and had taken,
perhaps, a little too much wine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was at any rate sulky, and in
a humour to resent interference. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd leave me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``to manage my own business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not my business too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; you haven't got to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and to put up with these people. I
shall make up my mind what to do myself, and I don't want anybody to
meddle with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ungrateful boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand all about that. Of course I'm ungrateful when I don't
do everything just as you wish it. You don't do any good. You only
set me against it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you expect to live, then? Are you always to be a burden on
me and your sister? I wonder that you've no shame. Your cousin Roger
is right. I will quit London altogether, and leave you to your own
wretchedness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what Roger says; is it? I always thought Roger was a fellow
of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is the best friend I have.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>What would Roger have thought had he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
heard this assertion from Lady Carbury?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s an ill-tempered, close-fisted, interfering cad, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
meddles with my affairs again, I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) what I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).
Upon my word, mother, these little disputes up in my bedroom ain't
very pleasant. Of course it's your house; but if you do allow me a
room, I think you might let me have it to myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>It was impossible
for Lady Carbury, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) present mood, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) present mood, to
explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that in no other way and at no other time could she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
ever find him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) came down to breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
escaped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in five minutes, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) returned no more till
some unholy hour in the morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was as good a pelican as ever
allowed the blood to be torn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own breast to satisfy the greed
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) young, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should have something back for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) blood,--some return for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sacrifices. This chick would take all
as long as there was a drop left, and then resent the fondling of
the mother-bird as interference. Again and again there came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
moments in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought that Roger Carbury was right. And yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that when the time came she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would not be able to be severe.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) almost hated herself for the weakness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own love,--but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) acknowledged it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should fall utterly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) must fall with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cruelty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) callous hardness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) insolence to
herself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wickedness and ruinous indifference to the future, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
must cling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to the last. All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had done, and all that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had borne,--all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was doing and bearing,--was it not for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sake?

<p/>Sir Felix had been in Grosvenor Square since his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) return from Carbury,
and had seen Madame Melmotte and Marie; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had seen them
together, and not a word had been said about the engagement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could
not make much use of the elder woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was as gracious as was
usual with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was never very gracious. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that Miss Longestaffe was coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>), which was a great bore,
as the young lady was <div class="bookquote">``fatigante.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Upon this Marie had declared that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) intended to like the young lady very much. <div class="bookquote">``Pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Madame
Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``You never like no person at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>At this Marie had looked
over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; that is all very well,--while
it lasts; but you care for no friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>From which Felix had judged
that Madame Melmotte at any rate knew of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) offer, and did not
absolutely disapprove of it. On the Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had received a note
at his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) club from Marie. <div class="bookquote">``Come on Sunday at half-past two. You will
find papa after lunch.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>This was in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) possession when his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mother
visited him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) bedroom, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had determined to obey the behest.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) intention, because he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had drunk too
much wine, and was sulky.

<p/>At about three on Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knocked at the door in Grosvenor Square
and asked for the ladies. Up to the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knocking,--even
after he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had knocked, and when the big porter was opening the
door,--he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) intended to ask for Mr. Melmotte; but at the last his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
courage failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was shown up into the drawing-room. There
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found Madame Melmotte, Marie, Georgiana Longestaffe, and--Lord
Nidderdale. Marie looked anxiously into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) face, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
had already been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) slid into a chair close to
Madame Melmotte, and endeavoured to seem at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) ease. Lord Nidderdale
continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) flirtation with Miss Longestaffe,--a flirtation which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) carried on in a half whisper, wholly indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) hostess
or the young lady of the house. <div class="bookquote">``We know what brings you here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came on purpose to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure, Lord Nidderdale, you didn't expect to find me here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord bless you, I knew all about it, and came on purpose. It's a
great institution; isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an institution you mean to belong to,--permanently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. I did have thoughts about it as fellows do when they
talk of going into the army or to the bar; but I couldn't pass. That
fellow there is the happy man. I shall go on coming here, because
you're here. I don't think you'll like it a bit, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose I shall, Lord Nidderdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div><p/>After a while Marie contrived to be alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover near one
of the windows for a few seconds. <div class="bookquote">``Papa is down-stairs in the
book-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Lord Alfred was told when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) came that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was
out.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>It was evident to Sir Felix that everything was prepared for
him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You go down,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``and ask the man to show you into
the book-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I come up again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but leave a note for me here under cover to Madame Didon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Now
Sir Felix was sufficiently at home in the house to know that Madame
Didon was Madame Melmotte's own woman, commonly called Didon by the
ladies of the family. <div class="bookquote">``Or send it by post,--under cover to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>). That
will be better. Go at once, now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>It certainly did seem to Sir Felix
that the very nature of the girl was altered. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) went, just
shaking hands with Madame Melmotte, and bowing to Miss Longestaffe.

<p/>In a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) found himself with Mr. Melmotte in the chamber
which had been dignified with the name of the book-room. The great
financier was accustomed to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) Sunday afternoons here,
generally with the company of Lord Alfred Grendall. It may be
supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was meditating on millions, and arranging the prices
of money and funds for the New York, Paris, and London Exchanges. But
on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was waked from slumber, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) seemed to have
been enjoying with a cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Sir Felix?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you want the ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just been in the drawing-room, but I thought I'd look in on you
as I came down.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>It immediately occurred to Melmotte that the baronet
had come about his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) share of the plunder out of the railway, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at
once resolved to be stern in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) manner, and perhaps rude also. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should thrive best by resenting any interference
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) capacity as financier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had risen
high enough to venture on such conduct, and experience had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
that men who were themselves only half-plucked, might easily be cowed
by a savage assumption of superiority. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), too, had generally the
advantage of understanding the game, while those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
concerned did not, at any rate, more than half understand it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
could thus trade either on the timidity or on the ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
colleagues. When neither of these sufficed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) undisputed
mastery, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) cultivated the cupidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) liked
young associates because they were more timid and less greedy than
their elders. Lord Nidderdale's suggestions had soon been put at
rest, and Mr. Melmotte anticipated no greater difficulty with Sir
Felix. Lord Alfred he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been obliged to buy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad to see you, and all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, assuming a
certain exaltation of the eyebrows, which they who had many dealings
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) often found to be very disagreeable; <div class="bookquote">``but this is hardly a
day for business, Sir Felix, nor,--yet a place for business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix wished himself at the Beargarden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) certainly had come
about business,--business of a particular sort; but Marie had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that of all days Sunday would be the best, and had also told him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father was more likely to be in a good humour on Sunday than
on any other day. Sir Felix felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not been received with
good humour. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to intrude, Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not. I only thought I'd tell you. You might have been
going to speak about that railway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother was saying to me down in the country that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hoped you
attended to the business. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that there was nothing to attend
to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother doesn't understand anything at all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir
Felix.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Melmotte, I'm come,--I'm come to;--in short, Mr. Melmotte, I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) about it. Perhaps Miss Melmotte has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long have you and she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) understood each other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ever since I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``I
have indeed. I've spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sometimes. You know how that kind of
thing goes on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm blessed if I do. I know how it ought to go on. I know that when
large sums of money are supposed to be concerned, the young man
should speak to the father before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speaks to the girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s a fool
if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) don't, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants to get the father's money. So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has given

that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might thus ingratiate himself with the father. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I
should be awfully disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has consented to your coming to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes;--in a sort of a way. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knows that it all
depends on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s of age. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chooses to marry you, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can marry
you. If that's all you want, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) consent is enough. You're a baronet,
I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I'm a baronet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore you've come to your own property. You haven't to wait
for your father to die, and I dare say you are indifferent about
money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a view of things which Sir Felix felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was bound
to dispel, even at the risk of offending the father. <div class="bookquote">``Not exactly
that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you will give your daughter a fortune, of
course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I wonder you didn't come to me before you went to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). If my
daughter marries to please me, I shall give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) money, no doubt. How
much is neither here nor there. If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marries to please herself,
without considering me, I shan't give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a farthing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had hoped that you might consent, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've said nothing about that. It is possible. You're a man of
fashion and have a title of your own,--and no doubt a property. If
you'll show me that you've an income fit to maintain her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), I'll think
about it at any rate. What is your property, Sir Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>What could three or four thousand a year, or even five or six, matter
to a man like Melmotte? It was thus that Sir Felix looked at it. When
a man can hardly count his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) millions he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought not to ask questions
about trifling sums of money. But the question had been asked, and
the asking of such a question was no doubt within the prerogative of
a proposed father-in-law. At any rate, it must be answered. For a
moment it occurred to Sir Felix that he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) might conveniently tell the
truth. It would be nasty for the moment, but there would be nothing
to come after. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) to do so he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) could not be dragged down lower
and lower into the mire by cross-examinings. There might be an end
of all his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) hopes, but there would at the same time be an end of all
his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) misery. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) lacked the necessary courage. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't a large
property, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not like the Marquis of Westminster's, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>the scoundrel</b></font>)</div>said the horrid,
big, rich scoundrel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--not quite like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, with a sickly laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have got enough to support a baronet's title?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on how you want to support it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, putting
off the evil day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's your family seat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carbury Manor, down in Suffolk, near the Longestaffes, is the old
family place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't belong to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, very sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not yet. But I'm the heir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps if there is one thing in England more difficult than another
to be understood by men born and bred out of England, it is the
system under which titles and property descend together, or in
various lines. The jurisdiction of our Courts of Law is complex, and
so is the business of Parliament. But the rules regulating them,
though anomalous, are easy to the memory compared with the mixed
anomalies of the peerage and primogeniture. They who are brought up
among it, learn it as children do a language, but strangers who begin
the study in advanced life, seldom make themselves perfect in it. It
was everything to Melmotte that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should understand the ways of the
country which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had adopted; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
clever at hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ignorance. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was puzzled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew that Sir
Felix was a baronet, and therefore presumed him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to be the head of the
family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew that Carbury Manor belonged to Roger Carbury, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) judged by the name it must be an old family property. And now
the baronet declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was heir to the man who was simply an
Esquire. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, the heir are you? But how did he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) get it before you?
You're the head of the family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am the head of the family, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, lying
directly. <div class="bookquote">``But the place won't be mine till he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) dies. It would take a
long time to explain it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>)'s a young man, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,--not what you'd call a young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isn't very old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were to marry and have children, how would it be then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix was beginning to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might have told the truth
with discretion. <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite know how it would be. I have always
understood that I am the heir. It's not very likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) will
marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in the meantime what is your own property?''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``In the meantime what is your own property?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father left me money in the funds and in railway stock,--and then
I am my mother's heir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have done me the honour of telling me that you wish to marry my
daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you then object to inform me the amount and nature of the
income on which you intend to support your establishment as a married
man? I fancy that the position you assume justifies the question on
my part.''  (<font color='red'><b>The swindler ruffian</b></font>)</div>The bloated swindler, the vile city ruffian, was certainly
taking a most ungenerous advantage of the young aspirant for wealth.
It was then that Sir Felix felt his (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) own position. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) not a
baronet, and a gentleman, and a very handsome fellow, and a man of
the world who had been in a crack regiment? If this surfeited sponge
of speculation, this crammed commercial cormorant, wanted more
than that for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter, why could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not say so without asking
disgusting questions such as these,--questions which it was quite
impossible that a gentleman should answer? Was it not sufficiently
plain that any gentleman proposing to marry the daughter of such
a man as Melmotte, must do so under the stress of pecuniary
embarrassment? Would it not be an understood bargain that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
provided the rank and position, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would provide the money? And yet
the vulgar wretch took advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) assumed authority to ask
these dreadful questions! Sir Felix stood silent, trying to look the
man in the face, but failing;--wishing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was well out of the
house, and at the Beargarden. <div class="bookquote">``You don't seem to be very clear about
your own circumstances, Sir Felix. Perhaps you will get your lawyer
to write to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps that will be best,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>said the lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Either that, or to give it up. My daughter, no doubt, will have
money; but money expects money.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>At this moment Lord Alfred entered
the room. <div class="bookquote">``You're very late to-day, Alfred. Why didn't you come as
you said you would?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was here more than an hour ago, and they said you were out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't been out of this room all day,--except to lunch. Good
morning, Sir Felix. Ring the bell, Alfred, and we'll have a little
soda and brandy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix had gone through some greeting with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) fellow Director, Lord Alfred, and at last succeeded in getting
Melmotte to shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know
anything about that young fellow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Melmotte asked as soon as the door
was closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a baronet without a shilling;--was in the army and had to leave
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Lord Alfred as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) face in a big tumbler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Without a shilling! I supposed so. But he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s heir to a place down in
Suffolk;--eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it. It's the same name, and that's about all. Mr.
Carbury has a small property there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might give it to me
to-morrow. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would, though there isn't much of it. That young
fellow has nothing to do with it whatever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Mr. Melmotte as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) speculated upon it, almost
admired the young man's impudence.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIV.

<p/>MILES GRENDALL``S TRIUMPH.


<p/>Sir Felix as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) walked down to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) club felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been
checkmated,--and was at the same time full of wrath at the insolence
of the man who had so easily beaten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the field. As far
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see, the game was over. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might marry Marie
Melmotte. The father had told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so much himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) perfectly
believed the truth of that oath which Marie had sworn. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not
doubt but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'d stick to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) close enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was in love with
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), which was natural; and was a fool,--which was perhaps also
natural. But romance was not the game which he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was playing. People
told him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) that when girls succeeded in marrying without their parents'
consent, fathers were always constrained to forgive them at last.
That might be the case with ordinary fathers. But Melmotte was
decidedly not an ordinary father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was,--so Sir Felix declared to
himself,--perhaps the greatest brute ever created. Sir Felix could
not but remember that elevation of the eyebrows, and the brazen
forehead, and the hard mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had found himself quite unable to
stand up against Melmotte, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) cursed and swore at the man as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was carried down to the Beargarden in a cab.

<p/>But what should he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) do? Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) abandon Marie Melmotte altogether,
never go to Grosvenor Square again, and drop the whole family,
including the Great Mexican Railway? Then an idea occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).
Nidderdale had explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) application for
shares. <div class="bookquote">``You see we haven't bought any and therefore can't sell any.
There seems to be something in that. I shall explain it all to my
governor, and get him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) to go a thou' or two. If he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) sees his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) way to get
the money back, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>)'d do that and let me have the difference.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>On that
Sunday afternoon Sir Felix thought over all this. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>)
`go a thou,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and get the difference?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) made a mental calculation.
#12 10_s._ per #100! #125 for a thousand! and all paid in ready
money. As far as Sir Felix could understand, directly the one
operation had been perfected the thousand pounds would be available
for another. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) looked into it with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) intelligence he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) began to perceive that that was the way in which the
Melmottes of the world made their money. There was but one objection.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not got the entire thousand pounds. But luck had been on the
whole very good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had more than the half of it in real
money, lying at a bank in the city at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had opened an account.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had very much more than the remainder in I. O. U.``s from
Dolly Longestaffe and Miles Grendall. In fact if every man had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own,--and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom glowed with indignation as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reflected on the
injustice with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was kept out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could go into
the city and take up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shares to-morrow, and still have ready money
at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) command. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do this, would not such conduct on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
part be the best refutation of that charge of not having any fortune
which Melmotte had brought against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would endeavour to work
the money out of Dolly Longestaffe;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) entertained an idea that
though it would be impossible to get cash from Miles Grendall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
might use his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) claim against Miles in the city. Miles was Secretary to
the Board, and might perhaps contrive that the money required for the
shares should not be all ready money. Sir Felix was not very clear
about it, but thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) might possibly in this way use the
indebtedness of Miles Grendall. <div class="bookquote">``How I do hate a fellow who does not
pay up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sat alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) club, waiting for
some friend to come in. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) formed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head Draconic laws which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would fain have executed upon men who lost money at play and did
not pay. <div class="bookquote">``How the deuce fellows can look one in the face, is what I
can't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said to himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought over this great stroke of exhibiting himself to Melmotte
as a capitalist till he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) idea of abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) suit.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wrote a note to Marie Melmotte in accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
instructions.


<p/>DEAR M.,

<p/>Your father cut up very rough,--about money. Perhaps you
had better see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) yourself; or would your mother?

<p/>Yours always,

<p/>F.


<p/>This, as directed, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) put under cover to Madame Didon,--Grosvenor
Square, and posted at the club. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had put nothing at any rate in the
letter which could commit him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>There was generally on Sundays a house dinner, so called, at eight
o'clock. Five or six men would sit down, and would always gamble
afterwards. On this occasion Dolly Longestaffe sauntered in at about
seven in quest of sherry and bitters, and Felix found the opportunity
a good one to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) money. ``You couldn't cash your I. O. U.<div class="bookquote">``s
for me to-morrow;--could you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow! oh, lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you why. You know I'd tell you anything because I think we
are really friends. I'm after that daughter of Melmotte's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm told you're to have her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that. I mean to try at any rate. I've gone in you
know for that Board in the city.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything about Boards, my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you do, Dolly. You remember that American fellow, Montague's
friend, that was here one night and won all our money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The chap that had the waistcoat, and went away in the morning to
California. Fancy starting to California after a hard night. I always
wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) got there alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--I can't explain to you all about it, because you hate those
kinds of things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And because I am such a fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you're a fool at all, but it would take a week. But
it's absolutely essential for me to take up a lot of shares in the
city to-morrow;--or perhaps Wednesday might do. I'm bound to pay
for them, and old Melmotte will think that I'm utterly hard up if
I don't. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said as much, and the only objection about me
and this girl of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is as to money. Can't you understand, now, how
important it may be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's always important to have a lot of money. I know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have gone in for this kind of thing if I hadn't thought
I was sure. You know how much you owe me, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's about eleven hundred pounds!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't wonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Miles Grendall owes me two thousand. Grasslough and Nidderdale
when they lose always pay with Miles's I. O. U.'s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So should I, if I had them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll come to that soon that there won't be any other stuff going,
and they really ain't worth anything. I don't see what's the use of
playing when this rubbish is shoved about the table. As for Grendall
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) has no feeling about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least, I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll try and get me the money, won't you, Dolly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Melmotte has been at me twice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wants me to agree to sell
something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s an old thief, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) means to rob me. You
may tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'ll let me have the money in the way I've
proposed, you are to have a thousand pounds out of it. I don't know
any other way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could write me that,--in a business sort of way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't do that, Carbury. What's the use? I never write any
letters. I can't do it. You tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that; and if the sale comes off,
I'll make it straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div><p/>Miles Grendall also dined there, and after dinner, in the
smoking-room, Sir Felix tried to do a little business with the
Secretary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) began his (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) operations with unusual courtesy, believing
that the man must have some influence with the great distributor of
shares. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to take up my shares in that company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir
Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah;--indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>And Miles enveloped himself from head to foot in
smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't quite understand about it, but Nidderdale saw Melmotte and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) has explained it. I think I shall go in for a couple of thousand
on Wednesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh;--ah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be the proper thing to do;--won't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good--thing to do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>Miles Grendall smoked harder and harder as
the suggestions were made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it always ready money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always ready money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) head, as though in
reprobation of so abominable an institution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose they allow some time to their own Directors, if a deposit,
say 50 per cent., is made for the shares?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll give you half the number, which would come to the same
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix turned this over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mind, but let him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) look at it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
would, could not see the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) companion's remark. <div class="bookquote">``You know
I should want to sell again,--for the rise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh; you'll want to sell again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore I must have the full number.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could sell half the number, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm determined to begin with ten shares;--that's #1,000. Well;--I
have got the money, but I don't want to draw out so much. Couldn't
you manage for me that I should get them on paying 50 per cent.
down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Melmotte does all that himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You could explain, you know, that you are a little short in your own
payments to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>This Sir Felix said, thinking it to be a delicate
mode of introducing his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) claim upon the Secretary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's private,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles frowning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it's private; but if you would pay me the money I could
buy the shares with it, though they are public.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think we could mix the two things together, Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't help me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, when the deuce will you pay me what you owe me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix was
driven to this plain expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) demand by the impassibility of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) debtor. Here was a man who did not pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) debts of honour, who
did not even propose any arrangement for paying them, and who yet
had the impudence to talk of not mixing up private matters with
affairs of business! It made the young baronet very sick. Miles
Grendall smoked on in silence. There was a difficulty in answering the
question, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) therefore made no answer. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know how much you
owe me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>continued the baronet, determined to persist now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had
commenced the attack. There was a little crowd of other men in the
room, and the conversation about the shares had been commenced in
an under-tone. These two last questions Sir Felix had asked in a
whisper, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) countenance showed plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was speaking in
anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to talk about it here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not going to talk about it here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. This is a public room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to talk about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will any fellow come up-stairs and play a game of billiards?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said
Miles Grendall rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) chair. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) walked slowly out of
the room, leaving Sir Felix to take what revenge he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) pleased. For a
moment Sir Felix thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) would expose the transaction to the
whole room; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was afraid, thinking that Miles Grendall was a
more popular man than himself.

<p/>It was Sunday night; but not the less were the gamblers assembled in
the card-room at about eleven. Dolly Longestaffe was there, and with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) the two lords, and Sir Felix, and Miles Grendall of course, and,
I regret to say, a much better man than any of them, Paul Montague.
Sir Felix had doubted much as to the propriety of joining the party.
What was the use of playing with a man who seemed by general consent
to be liberated from any obligation to pay? But then if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not
play with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), where should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) find another gambling table? They
began with whist, but soon laid that aside and devoted themselves to
loo. The least respected man in that confraternity was Grendall, and
yet it was in compliance with the persistency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) suggestion that
they gave up the nobler game. <div class="bookquote">``Let's stick to whist; I like cutting
out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Grasslough. <div class="bookquote">``It's much more jolly having nothing to do now
and then; one can always bet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly shortly afterwards. <div class="bookquote">``I hate
loo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix in answer to a third application. <div class="bookquote">``I like whist
best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale, <div class="bookquote">``but I'll play anything anybody likes;--pitch
and toss if you please.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>But Miles Grendall had his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) way, and loo was
the game.

<p/>At about two o'clock Grendall was the only winner. The play had not
been very high, but nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had won largely. Whenever a
large pool had collected itself he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) swept it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) garners. The
men opposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) hardly grudged him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) this stroke of luck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had
hitherto been unlucky; and they were able to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) own
paper, which was so valueless that they parted with it without a
pang. Even Dolly Longestaffe seemed to have a supply of it. The only
man there not so furnished was Montague, and while the sums won were
quite small he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was allowed to pay with cash. But to Sir Felix it was
frightful to see ready money going over to Miles Grendall, as under
no circumstances could it be got back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Montague,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``just change these for the time. I'll take them back, if you still
have them when we've done.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) handed a lot of Miles's paper
across the table. The result of course would be that Felix would
receive so much real money, and that Miles would get back more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
own worthless paper. To Montague it would make no difference, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was asked;--or rather was preparing to do so, when Miles
interfered. On what principle of justice could Sir Felix come between
him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) and another man? <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand this kind of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said. ``When I win from you, Carbury, I'll take my I. O. U.<div class="bookquote">``s, as long
as you have any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By George, that's kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I won't have them handed about the table to be changed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pay them yourself, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, laying a handful down on
the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let's have a row,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carbury is always making a row,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Grasslough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles Grendall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't make more row than anybody else; but I do say that as we
have such a lot of these things, and as we all know that we don't get
cash for them as we want it, Grendall shouldn't take money and walk
off with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is walking off?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why should you be entitled to Montague's money more than any of
us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>asked Grasslough.

<p/>The matter was debated, and was thus decided. It was not to be
allowed that Miles's paper should be negotiated at the table in
the manner that Sir Felix had attempted to adopt. But Mr. Grendall
pledged his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) honour that when they broke up the party he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) would apply
any money that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) might have won to the redemption of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) I. O. U.``s,
paying a regular percentage to the holders of them. The decision
made Sir Felix very cross. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) knew that their condition at six or
seven in the morning would not be favourable to such commercial
accuracy,--which indeed would require an accountant to effect it; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) felt sure that Miles, if still a winner, would in truth walk off
with the ready money.

<p/>For a considerable time he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) did not speak, and became very moderate in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) play, tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) cards about, almost always losing, but losing
a minimum, and watching the board. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was sitting next to Grendall,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) observed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) neighbour moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) chair
farther and farther away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>), and nearer to Dolly Longestaffe,
who was next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) on the other side. This went on for an hour,
during which Grendall still won,--and won heavily from Paul Montague.
<div class="bookquote">``I never saw a fellow have such a run of luck in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said
Grasslough. <div class="bookquote">``You've had two trumps dealt to you every hand almost
since we began!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever so many hands I haven't played at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've always won when I've played,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``I've been looed
every time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You oughtn't to begrudge me one run of luck, when I've lost
so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles, who, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) began, had destroyed paper
counters of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) own making, supposed to represent considerably above
#1,000, and had also,--which was of infinitely greater concern to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>),--received an amount of ready money which was quite a godsend to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good of talking about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``I hate all
this row about winning and losing. Let's go on, or go to bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
idea of going to bed was absurd. So they went on. Sir Felix, however,
hardly spoke at all, played very little, and watched Miles Grendall
without seeming to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>). At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) felt certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) saw
a card go into the man's sleeve, and remembered at the moment that
the winner had owed his (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) success to a continued run of aces. He (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) was
tempted to rush at once upon the player, and catch the card on his (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>)
person. But he (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) feared. Grendall was a big man; and where would he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) be
if there should be no card there? And then, in the scramble, there
would certainly be at any rate a doubt. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) knew that the men
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) would be most unwilling to believe such an accusation.
Grasslough was Grendall's friend, and Nidderdale and Dolly
Longestaffe would infinitely rather be cheated than suspect any one
of their own set of cheating them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) feared both the violence of
the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) should accuse, and also the impassive good humour of the
others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) let that opportunity pass by, again watched, and again saw
the card abstracted. Thrice he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) saw it, till it was wonderful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
that others also should not see it. As often as the deal came round,
the man did it. Felix watched more closely, and was certain that in
each round the man had an ace at least once. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that
nothing could be easier. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleaded a headache, got up, and
went away, leaving the others playing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost nearly a thousand
pounds, but it had been all in paper. <div class="bookquote">``There's something the matter
with that fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Grasslough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's always something the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is so awfully greedy about his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) money.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>Miles had become somewhat
triumphant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The less said about that, Grendall, the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale.
<div class="bookquote">``We have put up with a good deal, you know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) has put up with
as much as anybody.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>Miles was cowed at once, and went on dealing
without manoeuvring a card on that hand.




<p/>CHAPTER XXV.

<p/>IN GROSVENOR SQUARE.


<p/>Marie Melmotte was hardly satisfied with the note which she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) received
from Didon early on the Monday morning. With a volubility of French
eloquence, Didon declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be turned out of the house
if either Monsieur or Madame were to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was doing. Marie
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that Madame would certainly never dismiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well,
perhaps not Madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Didon/Madame Didon</b></font>)</div>said Didon, who knew too much about Madame to
be dismissed; <div class="bookquote">``but Monsieur!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Marie declared that by no possibility
could Monsieur know anything about it. In that house nobody ever told
anything to Monsieur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) was regarded as the general enemy, against
whom the whole household was always making ambushes, always firing
guns from behind rocks and trees. It is not a pleasant condition for
a master of a house; but in this house the master at any rate knew
how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was placed. It never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to trust any one. Of
course his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) daughter might run away. But who would run away with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
without money? And there could be no money except from him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knew
himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was not the man to forgive a girl,
and then bestow his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wealth on the Lothario who had injured him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) daughter was valuable to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might make him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) the
father-in-law of a Marquis or an Earl; but the higher that he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) rose
without such assistance, the less need had he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) daughter's
aid. Lord Alfred was certainly very useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>). Lord Alfred had
whispered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) ear that by certain conduct and by certain uses of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) himself might be made a baronet. <div class="bookquote">``But if they should
say that I'm not an Englishman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>suggested Melmotte. Lord Alfred had
explained that it was not necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) should have been born in
England, or even that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) should have an English name. No questions
would be asked. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) first get into Parliament, and then spend
a little money on the proper side,--by which Lord Alfred meant the
Conservative side,--and be munificent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) entertainments, and the
baronetcy would be almost a matter of course. Indeed, there was no
knowing what honours might not be achieved in the present days by
money scattered with a liberal hand. In these conversations, Melmotte
would speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) money and power of making money as though they
were unlimited,--and Lord Alfred believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>).

<p/>Marie was dissatisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) letter,--not because it described her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
father as <div class="bookquote">``cutting up very rough.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) who had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) life that was a matter of course. But there was no word of
love in the note. An impassioned correspondence carried on through
Didon would be delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was quite capable of loving,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did love the young man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had, no doubt, consented to
accept the addresses of others whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did not love,--but this
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had done at the moment almost of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) first introduction to the
marvellous world in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was now living. As days went on she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
ceased to be a child, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) courage grew within her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) became
conscious of an identity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own, which feeling was produced
in great part by the contempt which accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) increasing
familiarity with grand people and grand names and grand things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
was no longer afraid of saying No to the Nidderdales on account of
any awe of them personally. It might be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) should acknowledge
herself to be obliged to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was drifting
away even from the sense of that obligation. Had her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mind been as it
was now when Lord Nidderdale first came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) might indeed have
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), who, as a man, was infinitely better than Sir Felix, and
who, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought it to be necessary, would have put some grace
into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love-making. But at that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had been childish. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to be a child, had hardly spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), child
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was, had resented such usage. But a few months in London
had changed all this, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was a child no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was in
love with Sir Felix, and had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) love. Whatever difficulties
there might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) intended to be true. If necessary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would
run away. Sir Felix was her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) idol, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) abandoned herself to its
worship. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) desired that her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) idol should be of flesh and blood,
and not of wood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was at first half-inclined to be angry; but as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did not
know Didon as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) might be afraid to trust
his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) raptures to such custody. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) club, and
having no such fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could write warmly.


<p/>--, Grosvenor Square.
Early Monday Morning.

<p/>DEAREST, DEAREST FELIX,

<p/>I have just got your note;--such a scrap! Of course papa
would talk about money because he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) never thinks of anything
else. I don't know anything about money, and I don't
care in the least how much you have got. Papa has got
plenty, and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) would give us some if we were once
married. I have told mamma, but mamma is always afraid of
everything. Papa is very cross to her (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) sometimes;--more so
than to me. I will try to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), though I can't always
get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>). I very often hardly see him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) all day long. But
I don't mean to be afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), and will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) that
on my word and honour I will never marry any one except
you. I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will beat me, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) does, I'll
bear it,--for your sake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) does beat mamma sometimes, I
know.

<p/>You can write to me quite safely through Didon. I think if
you would call some day and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) something, it would
help, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is very fond of money. Do write and tell me
that you love me. I love you better than anything in the
world, and I will never,--never give you up. I suppose you
can come and call,--unless papa tells the man in the hall
not to let you in. I'll find that out from Didon, but I
can't do it before sending this letter. Papa dined out
yesterday somewhere with that Lord Alfred, so I haven't
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) since you were here. I never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) goes into the city in the morning. Now I am going
down-stairs to breakfast with mamma and that Miss
Longestaffe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) is a stuck-up thing. Didn't you think so
at Caversham?

<p/>Good-bye. You are my own, own, own darling Felix,

<p/>And I am your own, own affectionate ladylove,

<p/>MARIE.


<p/>Sir Felix when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) read this letter at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) club in the afternoon of
the Monday, turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) nose and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) thought if
there were much of that kind of thing to be done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) could not go on
with it, even though the marriage were certain, and the money secure.
<div class="bookquote">``What an infernal little ass!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) said to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) crumpled the
letter up.

<p/>Marie having intrusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) letter to Didon, together with a little
present of gloves and shoes, went down to breakfast. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mother was
the first there, and Miss Longestaffe soon followed. That lady, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was not expected to breakfast with the master of
the house, abandoned the idea of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) meal sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
own room. Madame Melmotte she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) must endure. With Madame Melmotte she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
had to go out in the carriage every day. Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could only go to
those parties to which Madame Melmotte accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). If the London
season was to be of any use at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) must accustom herself to
the companionship of Madame Melmotte. The man kept himself very
much apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) only at dinner, and that not often.
Madame Melmotte was very bad; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was silent, and seemed to
understand that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) guest was only her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) guest as a matter of business.

<p/>But Miss Longestaffe already perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) old acquaintances
were changed in their manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) dear
friend Lady Monogram, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had known intimately as Miss Triplex,
and whose marriage with Sir Damask Monogram had been splendid
preferment, telling how she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been kept down in Suffolk at the time
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) friend's last party, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been driven to consent
to return to London as the guest of Madame Melmotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) hoped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) friend would not throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) off on that account. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been
very affectionate, with a poor attempt at fun, and rather humble.
Georgiana Longestaffe had never been humble before; but the Monograms
were people so much thought of and in such an excellent set! She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
would do anything rather than lose the Monograms. But it was of no
use. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been humble in vain, for Lady Monogram had not even
answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) note. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never really cared for anybody but herself,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Georgiana said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) wretched solitude. Then, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had found
that Lord Nidderdale's manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had been quite changed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was not a fool, and could read these signs with sufficient
accuracy. There had been little flirtations between her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) and
Nidderdale,--meaning nothing, as every one knew that Nidderdale must
marry money; but in none of them had he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) spoke
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) in Madame Melmotte's drawing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could see it
in the faces of people as they greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) in the park,--especially
in the faces of the men. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had always carried herself with a
certain high demeanour, and had been able to maintain it. All that
was now gone from her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) knew it. Though the thing was as yet
but a few days old she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) understood that others understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had
degraded herself. <div class="bookquote">``What's all this about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>Lord Grasslough had said
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) come into a room behind Madame Melmotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had
simpered, had tried to laugh, and had then turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Impudent scoundrel!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) said to herself, knowing that a fortnight
ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) would not have dared to address her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) in such a tone.

<p/>A day or two afterwards an occurrence took place worthy of
commemoration. Dolly Longestaffe called on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) sister! His (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) mind must
have been much stirred when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) allowed himself to be moved to such
uncommon action. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) came too at a very early hour, not much after
noon, when it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) custom to be eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) breakfast in bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
declared at once to the servant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) did not wish to see Madame
Melmotte or any of the family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had called to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
was therefore shown into a separate room where Georgiana joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What's all this about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) tried to laugh as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``What brings you here, I
wonder? This is quite an unexpected compliment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My being here doesn't matter. I can go anywhere without doing much
harm. Why are you staying with these people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) sent you here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't have come, I suppose, unless you liked it. Is it because
they are none of them coming up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly that, Dolly. What a wonderful young man you are for
guessing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--not a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I feel ashamed for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody comes here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--everybody does not come and stay here as you are doing.
Everybody doesn't make themselves a part of the family. I have heard
of nobody doing it except you. I thought you used to think so much of
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think as much of myself as ever I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana, hardly
able to restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you nobody else will think much of you if you remain
here. I could hardly believe it when Nidderdale told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) say, Dolly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) didn't say much to me, but I could see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) thought. And
of course everybody thinks the same. How you can like the people
yourself is what I can't understand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like them,--I hate them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you come and live with them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dolly, it is impossible to make you understand. A man is so
different. You can go just where you please, and do what you like.
And if you're short of money, people will give you credit. And you
can live by yourself, and all that sort of thing. How should you like
to be shut up down at Caversham all the season?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind it,--only for the governor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have got a property of your own. Your fortune is made for you.
What is to become of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean about marrying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the poor girl, unable to be quite as
explicit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) brother, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father, and
mother, and sister. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I have to think of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how the Melmottes are to help you. The long and the
short of it is, you oughtn't to be here. It's not often I interfere,
but when I heard it I thought I'd come and tell you. I shall write to
the governor, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) too. He (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) should have known better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't write to papa, Dolly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall. I am not going to see everything going to the devil
without saying a word. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had left he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hurried down to some club that was
open,--not the Beargarden, as it was long before the Beargarden
hours,--and actually did write a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father.


<p/>MY DEAR FATHER,

<p/>I have seen Georgiana at Mr. Melmotte's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
ought not to be there. I suppose you don't know it, but
everybody says he (<font color='blue'><b>FATHER</b></font>)'s a swindler. For the sake of the family
I hope you will get her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) home again. It seems to me that
Bruton Street is the proper place for the girls at this
time of the year.

<p/>Your affectionate son,

<p/>ADOLPHUS LONGESTAFFE.


<p/>This letter fell upon old Mr. Longestaffe at Caversham like a
thunderbolt. It was marvellous to him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son should have
been instigated to write a letter. The Melmottes must be very bad
indeed,--worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had thought,--or their iniquities would not
have brought about such energy as this. But the passage which angered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) most was that which told him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) ought to have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
family back to town. This had come from his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son, who had refused to
do anything to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) difficulties.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVI.

<p/>MRS. HURTLE.


<p/>Paul Montague at this time lived in comfortable lodgings in Sackville
Street, and ostensibly the world was going well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had
many troubles. His (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) troubles in reference to Fisker, Montague, and
Montague,--and also their consolation,--are already known to the
reader. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was troubled too about his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) love, though when he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) allowed
his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) mind to expatiate on the success of the great railway he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would
venture to hope that on that side his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) life might perhaps be blessed.
Henrietta had at any rate as yet showed no disposition to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
cousin's offer. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was troubled too about the gambling, which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
disliked, knowing that in that direction there might be speedy
ruin, and yet returning to it from day to day in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own
conscience. But there was yet another trouble which culminated just
at this time. One morning, not long after that Sunday night which
had been so wretchedly spent at the Beargarden, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) got into a cab in
Piccadilly and had himself taken to a certain address in Islington.
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) knocked at a decent, modest door,--at such a house as
men live in with two or three hundred a year,--and asked for Mrs.
Hurtle. Yes;--Mrs. Hurtle lodged there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was shown into the
drawing-room. There he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) stood by the round table for a quarter of
an hour turning over the lodging-house books which lay there, and
then Mrs. Hurtle entered the room. Mrs. Hurtle was a widow whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had once promised to marry. <div class="bookquote">``Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said, with a quick,
sharp voice, but with a voice which could be very pleasant when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
pleased,--taking him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) by the hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``Paul, say that that
letter of yours must go for nothing. Say that it shall be so, and I
will forgive everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) replied, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hand in hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot say it! What do you mean? Will you dare to tell me that
your promises to me are to go for nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things are changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul hoarsely. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had come thither at her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
bidding because he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had felt that to remain away would be cowardly,
but the meeting was inexpressibly painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) did think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had sufficient excuse for breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) troth to this woman, but
the justification of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) conduct was founded on reasons which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
hardly knew how to plead to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had heard that of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) past life
which, had he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) heard it before, would have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) present
difficulty. But he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--did love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a certain fashion;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) offences, such as they were, did not debar her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
sympathies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are they changed? I am two years older, if you mean that.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked round at the glass, as though to see whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was become so haggard with age as to be unfit to become this
man's wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was very lovely, with a kind of beauty which we
seldom see now. In these days men regard the form and outward lines
of a woman's face and figure more than either the colour or the
expression, and women fit themselves to men's eyes. With padding
and false hair without limit a figure may be constructed of almost
any dimensions. The sculptors who construct them, male and female,
hairdressers and milliners, are very skilful, and figures are
constructed of noble dimensions, sometimes with voluptuous expansion,
sometimes with classic reticence, sometimes with dishevelled
negligence which becomes very dishevelled indeed when long out of the
sculptors' hands. Colours indeed are added, but not the colours which
we used to love. The taste for flesh and blood has for the day given
place to an appetite for horsehair and pearl powder. But Mrs. Hurtle
was not a beauty after the present fashion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was very dark,--a
dark brunette,--with large round blue eyes, that could indeed be
soft, but could also be very severe. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) silken hair, almost black,
hung in a thousand curls all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) head and neck. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) cheeks and
lips and neck were full, and the blood would come and go, giving a
varying expression to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) face with almost every word she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) spoke. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
nose also was full, and had something of the pug. But nevertheless
it was a nose which any man who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would swear to be perfect.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mouth was large, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) rarely showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) teeth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) chin was
full, marked by a large dimple, and as it ran down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) neck was
beginning to form a second. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) bust was full and beautifully shaped;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) invariably dressed as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) were oblivious, or at any
rate neglectful, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own charms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) dress, as Montague had seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), was always black,--not a sad weeping widow's garment, but silk
or woollen or cotton as the case might be, always new, always nice,
always well-fitting, and most especially always simple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was
certainly a most beautiful woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) knew it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) looked as
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) knew it,--but only after that fashion in which a woman
ought to know it. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) age she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never spoken to Montague. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
was in truth over thirty,--perhaps almost as near thirty-five as
thirty. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was one of those whom years hardly seem to touch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are beautiful as ever you were,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha! Do not tell me of that. I care nothing for my beauty unless it
can bind me to your love. Sit down there and tell me what it means.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) let go his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, and seated herself opposite to the chair
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you in my letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You told me nothing in your letter,--except that it was to be--off.
Why is it to be--off? Do you not love me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) threw herself
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) knees, and leaned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have come again across the Atlantic on purpose
to see you,--after so many months,--and will you not give me one
kiss? Even though you should leave me for ever, give me one kiss.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), not once, but with a long, warm embrace. How
could it have been otherwise? With all his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
would have remained away, but while she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) knelt there at his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet what
could he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) do but embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``Now tell me everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said,
seating herself on a footstool at his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) certainly did not look like a woman whom a man might ill treat
or scorn with impunity. Paul felt, even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was lavishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
caresses upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) might too probably turn and rend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) temper before,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had also known the truth and warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
travelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) from San Francisco to England, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been
very good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) in illness, in distress of mind and in poverty,--for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had been almost penniless in New York. When they landed at
Liverpool they were engaged as man and wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
affairs, had given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the whole history of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. This was before
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) second journey to America, when Hamilton K. Fisker was unknown
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) little or nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own life,--but
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a widow, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was travelling to Paris on
business. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at the London railway station, from which
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) started for Dover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was full of all a lover's ardour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had
offered to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had declined. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) must certainly tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) friend Roger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
engagement, and remembered also how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) knew of the lady to
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was engaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) became embarrassed. What were her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) means he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
did not know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) did know that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was some years older than himself,
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had spoken hardly a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own family.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had indeed said that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband had been one of the greatest
miscreants ever created, and had spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) release from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as
the one blessing she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had known before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had met Paul Montague. But
it was only when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought of all this after she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),--only
when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reflected how bald was the story which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must tell Roger
Carbury,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) became dismayed. Such had been the woman's
cleverness, such her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) charm, so great her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) power of adaptation, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had passed weeks in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daily company, with still progressing
intimacy and affection, without feeling that anything had been
missing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) friend, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) friend had declared to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that it
was impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should marry a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had met in a
railway train without knowing something about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Roger did all
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could to persuade the lover to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love,--and partially
succeeded. It is so pleasant and so natural that a young man should
enjoy the company of a clever, beautiful woman on a long journey,--so
natural that during the journey he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should allow himself to think that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may during her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whole life be all in all to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is at that
moment;--and so natural again that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistake when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! But Montague, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was half false to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
widow, was half true to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had pledged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said ought to bind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned to California, and learned
through the instrumentality of Hamilton K. Fisker, that in San
Francisco Mrs. Hurtle was regarded as a mystery. Some people did not
quite believe that there ever had been a Mr. Hurtle. Others said that
there certainly had been a Mr. Hurtle, and that to the best of their
belief he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) still existed. The fact, however, best known of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had shot a man through the head somewhere in Oregon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
not been tried for it, as the world of Oregon had considered that the
circumstances justified the deed. Everybody knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was very
clever and very beautiful,--but everybody also thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was
very dangerous. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) always had money when she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>Hamilton
Fisker said, <div class="bookquote">``but no one knew where it came from.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) wanted to
know why Paul inquired. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think, you know, that I should like
to go in for a life partnership, if you mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>said Hamilton K.
Fisker.

<p/>Montague had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) in New York as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) passed through on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) second
journey to San Francisco, and had then renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) promises in spite
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) cousin's caution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was going to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
could make of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) broken fortunes,--for at this time, as the reader
will remember, there was no great railway in existence,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had
promised to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>). Since that they had never met till this day.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had not made the promised journey to San Francisco, at any rate
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had left it. Letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) in England,
and these he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had answered by explaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), or endeavouring to
explain, that their engagement must be at an end. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) to London! <div class="bookquote">``Tell me everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said, leaning upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) and looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you,--when did you arrive here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, at this house, I arrived the night before last. On Tuesday
I reached Liverpool. There I found that you were probably in London,
and so I came on. I have come only to see you. I can understand that
you should have been estranged from me. That journey home is now so
long ago! Our meeting in New York was so short and wretched. I would
not tell you because you then were poor yourself, but at that moment
I was penniless. I have got my own now out from the very teeth of
robbers.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could be very
persistent in claiming her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own,--or what she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) might think to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
own. <div class="bookquote">``I could not get across to San Francisco as I said I would, and

his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) arm was again thrown over her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), so as to press her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) head to his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
knee. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``tell me about yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) position was embarrassing and very odious to himself. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) done
his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) duty properly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) would gently have pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) from him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>), have
sprung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) legs, and have declared that, however faulty might have
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) previous conduct, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) now found himself bound to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) did not intend to become her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) husband. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was
either too much of a man or too little of a man for conduct such as
that. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did make the avowal to himself, even at that moment as she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
sat there. Let the matter go as it would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) should never be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would marry no one unless it was Hetta Carbury. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
not at all know how to get this said with proper emphasis, and yet
with properly apologetic courtesy. <div class="bookquote">``I am engaged here about this
railway,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You have heard, I suppose, of our projected

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heard of it! San Francisco is full of it. Hamilton Fisker is the
great man of the day there, and, when I left, your uncle was buying
a villa for seventy-four thousand dollars. And yet they say that the

very hard upon Fisker for coming here and doing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's doing very well, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul, with some feeling of

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the manager here in England?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,--I am a member of the firm that manages it at San Francisco; but

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grand enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``if it all came honestly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I prefer to be stopped by the ditches,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Montague.

filch only a little, pretending to despise the only thing that is
dear to them in the world. Here is a man who boldly says that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
recognises no such law; that wealth is power, and that power is good,
and that the more a man has of wealth the greater and the stronger
and the nobler he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can be. I love a man who can turn the hobgoblins

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Montague had formed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own opinions about Melmotte. Though connected
with the man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed their Grand Director to be as vile a
scoundrel as ever lived. Mrs. Hurtle's enthusiasm was very pretty,
and there was something of feminine eloquence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) words. But it

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would willingly have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) question unanswered, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) waited

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Winifrid! Yes, now for the first time, though I have called you
Paul from the moment you entered the room. Well, speak out. Is there
another woman that you love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment Paul Montague proved that at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was no
coward. Knowing the nature of the woman, how ardent, how impetuous
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could be, and how full of wrath, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) call
intending to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the truth which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now spoke. <div class="bookquote">``There is
another,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood silent, looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, thinking how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
commence her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attack upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), standing
quite upright, squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own right hand with the fingers of the
left. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, in a whisper;--<div class="bookquote">``that is the reason why I am

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was not the reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What;--can there be more reason than that,--better reason than that?

reasons? Let me hear your--other reasons, that I may tell you that
they are lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>The reasons were very difficult to tell, though when put forward by
Roger Carbury they had been easily pleaded. Paul knew but little
about Winifrid Hurtle, and nothing at all about the late Mr. Hurtle.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) reasons curtly put forward might have been so stated. <div class="bookquote">``We know
too little of each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What more do you want to know? You can know all for the asking.
Did I ever refuse to answer you? As to my knowledge of you and your
affairs, if I think it sufficient, need you complain? What is it that
you want to know? Ask anything and I will tell you. Is it about my
money? You knew when you gave me your word that I had next to none.
Now I have ample means of my own. You knew that I was a widow. What
more? If you wish to hear of the wretch that was my husband, I will
deluge you with stories. I should have thought that a man who loved
would not have cared to hear much of one--who perhaps was loved
once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) position was perfectly indefensible. It would have
been better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) not to have alluded to any reasons, but to have
remained firm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) assertion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) loved another woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) must
have acknowledged himself to be false, perjured, inconstant, and
very base. A fault that may be venial to those who do not suffer, is
damnable, deserving of an eternity of tortures, in the eyes of the
sufferer. He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) must have submitted to be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) was a fiend, and
might have had to endure whatever of punishment a lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wrath
could inflict upon him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) would have been called upon for no
further mental effort. His (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) position would have been plain. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>)
was all at sea. <div class="bookquote">``I wish to hear nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why tell me that we know so little of each other? That, surely,
is a poor excuse to make to a woman,--after you have been false to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Why did you not say that when we were in New York together?
Think of it, Paul. Is not that mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) could not at any rate be warranted in mentioning
Hetta Carbury's name. He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) had never even asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) love, and

explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), even had he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) been able, that a man may break a

engagement before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen Hetta Carbury, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
not accuse himself of falseness on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been brought
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolution by the rumours he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) past life, and
as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncertainty about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband. If Mr. Hurtle were alive,
certainly then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would not be a liar because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did not marry Mrs.
Hurtle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did not think himself to be a liar, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was not at once

let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) go without another word.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVII.

<p/>MRS. HURTLE GOES TO THE PLAY.


<p/>On the day after the visit just recorded, Paul Montague received the
following letter from Mrs. Hurtle:--


<p/>MY DEAR PAUL,--

<p/>I think that perhaps we hardly made ourselves understood
to each other yesterday, and I am sure that you do not
understand how absolutely my whole life is now at stake.
I need only refer you to our journey from San Francisco to
London to make you conscious that I really love you. To a
woman such love is all important. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cannot throw it from
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as a man may do amidst the affairs of the world. Nor,
if it has to be thrown from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), can she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bear the loss
as a man bears it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts have dwelt on it with
more constancy than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);--and then too her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) devotion has
separated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from other things. My devotion to you has
separated me from everything.

<p/>But I scorn to come to you as a suppliant. If you choose
to say after hearing me that you will put me away from you
because you have seen some one fairer than I am, whatever
course I may take in my indignation, I shall not throw
myself at your feet to tell you of my wrongs. I wish,
however, that you should hear me. You say that there is
some one you love better than you love me, but that you
have not committed yourself to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Alas, I know too much
of the world to be surprised that a man's constancy should
not stand out two years in the absence of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress.
A man cannot wrap himself up and keep himself warm with
an absent love as a woman does. But I think that some
remembrance of the past must come back upon you now that
you have seen me again. I think that you must have owned
to yourself that you did love me, and that you could love
me again. You sin against me to my utter destruction if
you leave me. I have given up every friend I have to
follow you. As regards the other--nameless lady, there can
be no fault; for, as you tell me, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows nothing of
your passion.

<p/>You hinted that there were other reasons,--that we know
too little of each other. You meant no doubt that you
knew too little of me. Is it not the case that you were
content when you knew only what was to be learned in those
days of our sweet intimacy, but that you have been made
discontented by stories told you by your partners at San
Francisco? If this be so, trouble yourself at any rate to
find out the truth before you allow yourself to treat a
woman as you propose to treat me. I think you are too good
a man to cast aside a woman you have loved,--like a soiled
glove,--because ill-natured words have been spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
by men, or perhaps by women, who know nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life.
My late husband, Caradoc Hurtle, was Attorney-General in
the State of Kansas when I married him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>), I being then in
possession of a considerable fortune left to me by my
mother. There his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) life was infamously bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) spent what
money he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) could get of mine, and then left me and the
State, and took himself to Texas;--where he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) drank himself
to death. I did not follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>), and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) absence I was
divorced from him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) in accordance with the laws of Kansas
State. I then went to San Francisco about property of my
mother's, which my husband had fraudulently sold to a
countryman of ours now resident in Paris,--having forged
my name. There I met you, and in that short story I tell
you all that there is to be told. It may be that you do
not believe me now; but if so, are you not bound to go
where you can verify your own doubts or my word?

<p/>I try to write dispassionately, but I am in truth
overborne by passion. I also have heard in California
rumours about myself, and after much delay I received your
letter. I resolved to follow you to England as soon as
circumstances would permit me. I have been forced to fight
a battle about my property, and I have won it. I had two
reasons for carrying this through by my personal efforts
before I saw you. I had begun it and had determined that
I would not be beaten by fraud. And I was also determined
that I would not plead to you as a pauper. We have talked
too freely together in past days of our mutual money
matters for me to feel any delicacy in alluding to them.
When a man and woman have agreed to be husband and wife
there should be no delicacy of that kind. When we came
here together we were both embarrassed. We both had some
property, but neither of us could enjoy it. Since that I
have made my way through my difficulties. From what I have
heard at San Francisco I suppose that you have done the
same. I at any rate shall be perfectly contented if from
this time our affairs can be made one.

<p/>And now about myself,--immediately. I have come here all
alone. Since I last saw you in New York I have not had
altogether a good time. I have had a great struggle and
have been thrown on my own resources and have been all
alone. Very cruel things have been said of me. You heard
cruel things said, but I presume them to have been said
to you with reference to my late husband. Since that they
have been said to others with reference to you. I have not
now come, as my countrymen do generally, backed with a
trunk full of introductions and with scores of friends
ready to receive me. It was necessary to me that I should
see you and hear my fate,--and here I am. I appeal to
you to release me in some degree from the misery of my
solitude. You know,--no one so well,--that my nature is
social and that I am not given to be melancholy. Let us be
cheerful together, as we once were, if it be only for a
day. Let me see you as I used to see you, and let me be
seen as I used to be seen.

<p/>Come to me and take me out with you, and let us dine
together, and take me to one of your theatres. If you wish
it I will promise you not to allude to that revelation you
made to me just now, though of course it is nearer to my
heart than any other matter. Perhaps some woman's vanity
makes me think that if you would only see me again, and
talk to me as you used to talk, you would think of me as
you used to think.

<p/>You need not fear but you will find me at home. I have no
whither to go,--and shall hardly stir from the house till
you come to me. Send me a line, however, that I may have
my hat on if you are minded to do as I ask you.

<p/>Yours with all my heart,

<p/>WINIFRID HURTLE.


<p/>This letter took her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) much time to write, though she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was very careful
so to write as to make it seem that it had flown easily from her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) pen.
She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) copied it from the first draught, but she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) copied it rapidly, with
one or two premeditated erasures, so that it should look to have
been done hurriedly. There had been much art in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had at any
rate suppressed any show of anger. In calling him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had so
written as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feel that if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would come he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) need not fear
the claws of an offended lioness:--and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was angry as a
lioness who had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) cub. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had almost ignored that other lady
whose name she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had not yet heard. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) lover's
entanglement with that other lady as a light thing which might easily
be put aside. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had said much of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) own wrongs, but had not said
much of the wickedness of the wrong doer. Invited as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had invited
him (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>), surely he (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) could not but come to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)! And then, in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) reference
to money, not descending to the details of dollars and cents, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
had studied how to make him (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) might marry her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) without
imprudence. As she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) read it over to herself she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thought that there
was a tone through it of natural feminine uncautious eagerness. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
put her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) letter up in an envelope, stuck a stamp on it and addressed
it,--and then threw herself back in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) chair to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
position.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doer</b></font>) should marry her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>),--or there should be something done which should
make the name of Winifrid Hurtle known to the world! She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had no plan
of revenge yet formed. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would not talk of revenge,--she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) told
herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would not even think of revenge,--till she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was
quite sure that revenge would be necessary. But she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) did think of it,
and could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thoughts from it for a moment. Could it be
possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), with all her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) intellectual gifts as well as those
of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) outward person, should be thrown over by a man whom well
as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--and she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) did love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) heart,--she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
regarded as greatly inferior to herself! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had promised to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should marry her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), or the world should hear the story of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perjury!

<p/>Paul Montague felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was surrounded by difficulties as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read the letter. That his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart was all the other way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite
sure; but yet it did seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that there was no escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
troubles open to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There was not a single word in this woman's
letter that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could contradict. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and had promised
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife,--and had determined to break his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was enveloped in dangerous mystery. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had so resolved before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever seen Hetta Carbury, having been
made to believe by Roger Carbury that a marriage with an unknown
American woman,--of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) only did know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was handsome and
clever,--would be a step to ruin. The woman, as Roger said, was an
adventuress,--might never have had a husband,--might at this moment
have two or three,--might be overwhelmed with debt,--might be
anything bad, dangerous, and abominable. All that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had heard at San
Francisco had substantiated Roger's views. <div class="bookquote">``Any scrape is better than
that scrape,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). Paul had believed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) Mentor,
and had believed with a double faith as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had seen Hetta
Carbury.

<p/>But what should he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) do now? It was impossible, after what had passed
between them, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should leave Mrs. Hurtle at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) lodgings at
Islington without any notice. It was clear enough to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
would not consent to be so left. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) present proposal,--though
it seemed to be absurd and almost comical in the tragical condition
of their present circumstances,--had in it some immediate comfort.
To take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) out and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) a dinner, and then go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to some
theatre, would be easy and perhaps pleasant. It would be easier,
and certainly much pleasanter, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had pledged herself to
abstain from talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) grievances. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) remembered some happy
evenings, delicious hours, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had so passed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), when they
were first together at New York. There could be no better companion
for such a festival. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could talk,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could listen as well as
talk. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could sit silent, conveying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) neighbour the sense
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) feminine charms by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) simple proximity. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had been very
happy when so placed. Had it been possible he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would have escaped
the danger now, but the reminiscence of past delights in some sort
reconciled him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to the performance of this perilous duty.

<p/>But when the evening should be over, how would he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)? When
the pleasant hour should have passed away and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) door, what should he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) then? He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) must make some
arrangement as to a future meeting. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was in a great
peril, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) did not know how he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) might best escape it. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could not
now go to Roger Carbury for advice; for was not Roger Carbury his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
rival? It would be for his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend's interest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should marry the
widow. Roger Carbury, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew well, was too honest a man to allow
himself to be guided in any advice he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might give by such a feeling,
but, still, on this matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could no longer tell everything to
Roger Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not say all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would have to say without
speaking of Hetta;--and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) love for Hetta he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not speak to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) rival.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had no other friend in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could confide. There was no other
human being he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could trust, unless it was Hetta herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought
for a moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would write a stern and true letter to the
woman, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that as it was impossible that there should ever
be marriage between them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) felt himself bound to abstain from
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) society. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) solitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) picture of
herself in London without even an acquaintance except himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
convinced himself that it would be impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thus;--


<p/>DEAR WINIFRID,

<p/>I will come for you to-morrow at half-past five. We will
dine together at the Thespian;--and then I will have a
box at the Haymarket. The Thespian is a good sort of
place, and lots of ladies dine there. You can dine in your
bonnet.

<p/>Yours affectionately,

<p/>P. M.


<p/>Some half-formed idea ran through his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) brain that P. M. was a safer
signature than Paul Montague. Then came a long train of thoughts as
to the perils of the whole proceeding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had
announced herself to the keeper of the lodging-house as engaged to
him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) had in a manner authorised the statement by declining
to contradict it at once. And now, after that announcement, he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>)
was assenting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) proposal that they should go out and amuse
themselves together. Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had always seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) to
be open, candid, and free from intrigue. He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) to be
impulsive, capricious, at times violent, but never deceitful. Perhaps
he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) was unable to read correctly the inner character of a woman whose
experience of the world had been much wider than his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) own. His (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) mind
misgave him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) that it might be so; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not treacherous. And yet did not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) present acts
justify him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) in thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was carrying on a plot against him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>)?
The note, however, was sent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) prepared for the evening of the
play, leaving the dangers of the occasion to adjust themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>)
ordered the dinner and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) took the box, and at the hour fixed he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) was
again at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lodgings.

<p/>The woman of the house with a smile showed him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) into Mrs. Hurtle's
sitting-room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) at once perceived that the smile was intended
to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) as an accepted lover. It was a smile half of
congratulation to the lover, half of congratulation to herself as
a woman that another man had been caught by the leg and made fast.
Who does not know the smile? What man, who has been caught and made
sure, has not felt a certain dissatisfaction at being so treated,
understanding that the smile is intended to convey to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a sense of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own captivity? It has, however, generally mattered but little to
us. If we have felt that something of ridicule was intended, because
we have been regarded as cocks with their spurs cut away, then we
also have a pride when we have declared to ourselves that upon the
whole we have gained more than we have lost. But with Paul Montague
at the present moment there was no satisfaction, no pride,--only
a feeling of danger which every hour became deeper, and stronger,
with less chance of escape. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was almost tempted at this moment to
detain the woman, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the truth,--and bear the immediate
consequences. But there would be treason in doing so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
not, could not do it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was left hardly a moment to think of this. Almost before the woman
had shut the door, Mrs. Hurtle came to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) bedroom, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) head. Nothing could be more simple than her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) dress, and
nothing prettier. It was now June, and the weather was warm, and the
lady wore a light gauzy black dress,--there is a fabric which the
milliners I think call grenadine,--coming close up round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) throat.
It was very pretty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was prettier even than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had on a hat, black also, small and simple, but very pretty. There
are times at which a man going to a theatre with a lady wishes her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to
be bright in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) apparel,--almost gorgeous; in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will hardly
be contented unless her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cloak be scarlet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress white, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gloves of some bright hue,--unless she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wear roses or jewels in
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair. It is thus our girls go to the theatre now, when they go
intending that all the world shall know who they are. But there are
times again in which a man would prefer that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion should be
very quiet in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress,--but still pretty; in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would choose
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should dress herself for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only. All this Mrs. Hurtle had
understood accurately; and Paul Montague, who understood nothing of
it, was gratified. <div class="bookquote">``You told me to have a hat, and here I am,--hat
and all.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) hand, and laughed, and looked pleasantly
at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as though there was no cause of unhappiness between them. The
lodging-house woman saw them enter the cab, and muttered some little
word as they went off. Paul did not hear the word, but was sure that
it bore some indistinct reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expected marriage.

<p/>Neither during the drive, nor at the dinner, nor during the
performance at the theatre, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) say a word in allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
engagement. It was with them, as in former days it had been at New
York. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whispered pleasant words to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), touching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm now and
again with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) finger as she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) spoke, seeming ever better inclined
to listen than to speak. Now and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) referred, after some
slightest fashion, to little circumstances that had occurred between
them, to some joke, some hour of tedium, some moment of delight; but
it was done as one man might do it to another,--if any man could have
done it so pleasantly. There was a scent which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once approved,
and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bore it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) handkerchief. There was a ring which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had once given her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wore it on the finger with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeve. With his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hands he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once adjusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
curls, and each curl was as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had placed it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had a way of
shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) head, that was very pretty,--a way that might, one would
think, have been dangerous at her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) age, as likely to betray those
first grey hairs which will come to disturb the last days of youth.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once told her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in sport to be more careful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) now shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
head again, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could still dare
to be careless. There are a thousand little silly softnesses which
are pretty and endearing between acknowledged lovers, with which
no woman would like to dispense, to which even men who are in love
submit sometimes with delight; but which in other circumstances would
be vulgar,--and to the woman distasteful. There are closenesses and
sweet approaches, smiles and nods and pleasant winkings, whispers,
innuendoes and hints, little mutual admirations and assurances that
there are things known to those two happy ones of which the world
beyond is altogether ignorant. Much of this comes of nature, but
something of it sometimes comes by art. Of such art as there may
be in it Mrs. Hurtle was a perfect master. No allusion was made to
their engagement,--not an unpleasant word was spoken; but the art was
practised with all its pleasant adjuncts. Paul was flattered to the
top of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bent; and, though the sword was hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knew that the sword must fall,--must partly fall that very
night,--still he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) enjoyed it.

<p/>There are men who, of their natures, do not like women, even though
they may have wives and legions of daughters, and be surrounded by
things feminine in all the affairs of their lives. Others again have
their strongest affinities and sympathies with women, and are rarely
altogether happy when removed from their influence. Paul Montague was
of the latter sort. At this time he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was thoroughly in love with Hetta
Carbury, and was not in love with Mrs. Hurtle. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would have given
much of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) golden prospects in the American railway to have had Mrs.
Hurtle reconveyed suddenly to San Francisco. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had a delight
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) presence. <div class="bookquote">``The acting isn't very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) said when the piece
was nearly over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it signify? What we enjoy or what we suffer depends upon
the humour. The acting is not first-rate, but I have listened and
laughed and cried, because I have been happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was bound to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) also had enjoyed the evening, and
was bound to say it in no voice of hypocritical constraint. <div class="bookquote">``It has
been very jolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And one has so little that is really jolly, as you call it. I wonder
whether any girl ever did sit and cry like that because her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover
talked to another woman. What I find fault with is that the writers
and actors are so ignorant of men and women as we see them every day.
It's all right that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should cry, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shouldn't cry there.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The
position described was so nearly her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) could say nothing
to this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had so spoken on purpose,--fighting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own battle after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own fashion, knowing well that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) words would confuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``A
woman hides such tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be found crying because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is unable
to hide them;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not willingly let the other woman see
them. Does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Medea did not weep when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) was introduced to Creusa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women are not all Medeas,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a dash of the savage princess about most of them. I am quite
ready if you like. I never want to see the curtain fall. And I have
had no nosegay brought in a wheelbarrow to throw on to the stage. Are
you going to see me home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not. I'm not a bit afraid of a London cab by myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But
of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to Islington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) at any rate as
much as that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) continued to talk during the whole journey. What a
wonderful place London was,--so immense, but so dirty! New York of
course was not so big, but was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) thought, pleasanter. But Paris
was the gem of gems among towns. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did not like Frenchmen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
liked Englishmen even better than Americans; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
could never like English women. <div class="bookquote">``I do so hate all kinds of buckram. I
like good conduct, and law, and religion too if it be not forced down
one's throat; but I hate what your women call propriety. I suppose
what we have been doing to-night is very improper; but I am quite
sure that it has not been in the least wicked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it has,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul Montague very tamely.

<p/>It is a long way from the Haymarket to Islington, but at last the
cab reached the lodging-house door. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, this is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Even about the houses there is an air of stiff-necked propriety
which frightens me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was getting out as she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) spoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
already knocked at the door. <div class="bookquote">``Come in for one moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) paid the cabman. The woman the while was standing with the
door in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. It was near midnight,--but, when people are
engaged, hours do not matter. The woman of the house, who was
respectability herself,--a nice kind widow, with five children, named
Pipkin,--understood that and smiled again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) followed the lady
into the sitting-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had already taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hat and was
flinging it on to the sofa as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) entered. <div class="bookquote">``Shut the door for one
moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) shut it. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) threw herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
arms, not kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) but looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Oh Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``my darling! Oh Paul, my love! I will not bear to be
separated from you. No, no;--never. I swear it, and you may believe
me. There is nothing I cannot do for love of you,--but to lose you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and looked away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
hands together. <div class="bookquote">``But Paul, I mean to keep my pledge to you to-night.
It was to be an island in our troubles, a little holiday in our hard
school-time, and I will not destroy it at its close. You will see me
again soon,--will you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) nodded assent, then took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) without a word.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII.

<p/>DOLLY LONGESTAFFE GOES INTO THE CITY.


<p/>It has been told how the gambling at the Beargarden went on one
Sunday night. On the following Monday Sir Felix did not go to the
club. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had watched Miles Grendall at play, and was sure that on
more than one or two occasions the man had cheated. Sir Felix did not
quite know what in such circumstances it would be best for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do.
Reprobate as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was himself, this work of villainy was new to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and
seemed to be very terrible. What steps ought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to take? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite
sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) facts, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feared that Nidderdale and Grasslough
and Longestaffe would not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would have told Montague,
but Montague had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) thought, hardly enough authority at the club to
be of any use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). On the Tuesday again he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) did not go to the club.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) felt severely the loss of the excitement to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had been
accustomed, but the thing was too important to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) to be slurred
over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) did not dare to sit down and play with the man who had
cheated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without saying anything about it. On the Wednesday
afternoon life was becoming unbearable to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sauntered into
the building at about five in the afternoon. There, as a matter of
course, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found Dolly Longestaffe drinking sherry and bitters.
<div class="bookquote">``Where the blessed angels have you been?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. Dolly was at
that moment alert with the sense of a duty performed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just
called on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister and written a sharp letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, and
felt himself to be almost a man of business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had fish of my own to fry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix, who had passed the last
two days in unendurable idleness. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) referred again to the money
which Dolly owed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), not making any complaint, not indeed asking for
immediate payment, but explaining with an air of importance that if
a commercial arrangement could be made, it might, at this moment, be
very serviceable to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm particularly anxious to take up those
shares,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you ought to have your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say that at all, old fellow. I know very well that you're
all right. You're not like that fellow, Miles Grendall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; no. Poor Miles has got nothing to bless himself with. I
suppose I could get it, and so I ought to pay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's no excuse for Grendall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A chap can't pay if he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hasn't got it, Carbury. A chap ought to pay
of course. I've had a letter from our lawyer within the last half
hour--here it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>And Dolly pulled a letter out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had opened and read indeed within the last hour, but which
had been duly delivered at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodgings early in the morning. <div class="bookquote">``My
governor wants to sell Pickering, and Melmotte wants to buy the
place. My governor can't sell without me, and I've asked for half the
plunder. I know what's what. My interest in the property is greater
than his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>). It isn't much of a place, and they are talking of #50,000,
over and above the debt upon it. #25,000 would pay off what I owe on
my own property, and make me very square. From what this fellow says
I suppose they're going to give in to my terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By George, that'll be a grand thing for you, Dolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. Of course I want it. But I don't like the place going. I'm
not much of a fellow, I know. I'm awfully lazy and can't get myself
to go in for things as I ought to do; but I've a sort of feeling that
I don't like the family property going to pieces. A fellow oughtn't
to let his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) family property go to pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never lived at Pickering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--and I don't know that it is any good. It gives us 3 per cent.
on the money it's worth, while the governor is paying 6 per cent.,
and I'm paying 25, for the money we've borrowed. I know more about it
than you'd think. It ought to be sold, and now I suppose it will be
sold. Old Melmotte knows all about it, and if you like I'll go with
you to the city to-morrow and make it straight about what I owe you.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'ll advance me #1,000, and then you can get the shares. Are you
going to dine here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would dine at the club, but declared, with
considerable mystery in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not stay and play
whist afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acceded willingly to Dolly's plan of visiting
Abchurch Lane on the following day, but had some difficulty in
inducing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend to consent to fix on an hour early enough for
city purposes. Dolly suggested that they should meet at the club at
4 P.M. Sir Felix had named noon, and promised to call at Dolly's
lodgings. They split the difference at last and agreed to start
at two. They then dined together, Miles Grendall dining alone at
the next table to them. Dolly and Grendall spoke to each other
frequently, but in that conversation the young baronet would not
join. Nor did Grendall ever address himself to Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``Is there
anything up between you and Miles?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, when they had
adjourned to the smoking-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There never was any love between you two, I know. But you used to
speak, and you've played with him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) all through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Played with him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)! I should think I have. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) did get such a
haul last Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) owes me more than you do now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the reason you haven't played the last two nights?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix paused a moment. <div class="bookquote">``No;--that is not the reason. I'll tell
you all about it in the cab to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) left the club,
declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) would go up to Grosvenor Square and see Marie
Melmotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) did go up to the Square, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) came to the house
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) would not go in. What was the good? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) could do nothing further
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) got old Melmotte's consent, and in no way could he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) so
probably do that as by showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had got money wherewith to buy
shares in the railway. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) did with himself during the remainder
of the evening the reader need not know, but on his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) return home at
some comparatively early hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) found this note from Marie.


<p/>Wednesday Afternoon.

<p/>DEAREST FELIX,

<p/>Why don't we see you? Mamma would say nothing if you
came. Papa is never in the drawing-room. Miss Longestaffe
is here of course, and people always come in in the
evening. We are just going to dine out at the Duchess of
Stevenage's. Papa, and mamma and I. Mamma told me that
Lord Nidderdale is to be there, but you need not be a bit
afraid. I don't like Lord Nidderdale, and I will never
take any one but the man I love. You know who that is.
Miss Longestaffe is so angry because she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) can't go with
us. What do you think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) telling me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) did not
understand being left alone? We are to go afterwards to a
musical party at Lady Gamut's. Miss Longestaffe is going
with us, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) hates music. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) is such a
set-up thing! I wonder why papa has her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) here. We don't go
anywhere to-morrow evening, so pray come.

<p/>And why haven't you written me something and sent it to
Didon? She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) won't betray us. And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) did, what matters?
I mean to be true. If papa were to beat me into a mummy
I would stick to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) told me once to take Lord
Nidderdale, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) told me to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
wants me to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) again. But I won't. I'll take no one
but my own darling.

<p/>Yours for ever and ever,

<p/>MARIE.


<p/>Now that the young lady had begun to have an interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own
in life, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was determined to make the most of it. All this was
delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but to Sir Felix it was simply <div class="bookquote">``a bother.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir
Felix was quite willing to marry the girl to-morrow,--on condition
of course that the money was properly arranged; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was not
willing to go through much work in the way of love-making with Marie
Melmotte. In such business he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) preferred Ruby Ruggles as a companion.

<p/>On the following day Felix was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) friend at the appointed time,
and was only kept an hour waiting while Dolly ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) breakfast and
struggled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) coat and boots. On their way to the city Felix
told his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) dreadful story about Miles Grendall. <div class="bookquote">``By George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said
Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``And you think you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) do it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not thinking at all. I'm sure I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) do it three times. I
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) always had an ace somewhere about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Dolly sat quite
silent thinking of it. <div class="bookquote">``What had I better do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George;--I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What should you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing at all. I shouldn't believe my own eyes. Or if I did, should
take care not to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't go on playing with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I should. It'd be such a bore breaking up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Dolly,--if you think of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very fine, my dear fellow, but I shouldn't think of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you won't give me your advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--no; I think I'd rather not. I wish you hadn't told me. Why
did you pick me out to tell me? Why didn't you tell Nidderdale?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) might have said, why didn't you tell Longestaffe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) wouldn't. Nobody would suppose that anybody would pick me out
for this kind of thing. If I'd known that you were going to tell me
such a story as this I wouldn't have come with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense, Dolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I can't bear these kind of things. I feel all in a
twitter already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to go on playing just the same?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) won anything very heavy I should begin to
think about it, I suppose. Oh; this is Abchurch Lane, is it? Now for
the man of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man of money received them much more graciously than Sir Felix
had expected. Of course nothing was said about Marie and no further
allusion was made to the painful subject of the baronet's <div class="bookquote">``property.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>Both Dolly and Sir Felix were astonished by the quick way in which
the great financier understood their views and the readiness with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) undertook to comply with them. No disagreeable questions
were asked as to the nature of the debt between the young men. Dolly
was called upon to sign a couple of documents, and Sir Felix to
sign one,--and then they were assured that the thing was done. Mr.
Adolphus Longestaffe had paid Sir Felix Carbury a thousand pounds,
and Sir Felix Carbury's commission had been accepted by Mr. Melmotte
for the purchase of railway stock to that amount. Sir Felix attempted
to say a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) endeavoured to explain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) object in this
commercial transaction was to make money immediately by reselling
the shares,--and to go on continually making money by buying at a
low price and selling at a high price. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) no doubt did believe that,
being a Director, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could once raise the means of beginning this
game, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could go on with it for an unlimited period;--buy and sell,
buy and sell;--so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have an almost regular income. This,
as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could understand, was what Paul Montague was allowed
to do,--simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had become a Director with a little money.
Mr. Melmotte was cordiality itself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could not be got to go
into particulars. It was all right. <div class="bookquote">``You will wish to sell again, of
course;--of course. I'll watch the market for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>When the young
men left the room all they knew, or thought that they knew, was, that
Dolly Longestaffe had authorised Melmotte to pay a thousand pounds on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) behalf to Sir Felix, and that Sir Felix had instructed the same
great man to buy shares with the amount. <div class="bookquote">``But why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) give you
the scrip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way westwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's all right with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes;--it's all right. Thousands of pounds to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) are only like
half-crowns to us fellows. I should say it's all right. All the same,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>)'s the biggest rogue out, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix already began to be
unhappy about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thousand pounds.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX.

<p/>MISS MELMOTTE``S COURAGE.


<p/>Lady Carbury continued to ask frequent questions as to the
prosecution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son's suit, and Sir Felix began to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
was persecuted. <div class="bookquote">``I have spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did Mr. Melmotte say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say;--what should he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) say? He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wanted to know what income I had got.
After all he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s an old screw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) forbid you to come there any more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mother, it's no use your cross-examining me. If you'll let me
alone I'll do the best I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has accepted you, herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has. I told you that at Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Felix, if I were you I'd run off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). I would indeed.
It's done every day, and nobody thinks any harm of it when you
marry the girl. You could do it now because I know you've got money.
From all I can hear she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s just the sort of girl that would go with
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>The son</b></font>)</div>The son sat silent, listening to these maternal councils. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
did believe that Marie would go off with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to propose
the scheme to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own father had almost alluded to such a
proceeding,--had certainly hinted that it was feasible,--but at the
same time had very clearly stated that in such case the ardent lover
would have to content himself with the lady alone. In any such event
as that there would be no fortune. But then, might not that only be a
threat? Rich fathers generally do forgive their daughters, and a rich
father with only one child would surely forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) returned
to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would do in this instance, graced with a title. Sir
Felix thought of all this as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat there silent. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother read his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
thoughts as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, Felix, there must be some
risk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy what it would be to be thrown over at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I
couldn't bear it. I think I should kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, Felix; you wouldn't do that. But when I say there would be
some risk I mean that there would be very little. There would be
nothing in it that ought to make him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) really angry. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has nobody
else to give his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) money to, and it would be much nicer to have his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
daughter, Lady Carbury, with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), than to be left all alone in the
world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't live with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), you know. I couldn't do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't live with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), Felix. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
parents. When the money was once settled you need see as little of
them as you pleased. Pray do not allow trifles to interfere with you.
If this should not succeed, what are you to do? We shall all starve
unless something be done. If I were you, Felix, I would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) away
at once. They say she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) is of age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't know where to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, almost stunned
into thoughtfulness by the magnitude of the proposition made to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``All that about Scotland is done with now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,--unless it were better to stay as we were, till the
money was settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; no! Everybody would be against you. If you take her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) off in a
spirited sort of way and then marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), everybody will be with you.
That's what you want. The father and mother will be sure to come
round, if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The mother is nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will come round if people speak up in your favour. I could get
Mr. Alf and Mr. Broune to help. I'd try it, Felix; indeed I would.
Ten thousand a year is not to be had every year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix gave no assent to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother's views. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt no desire to
relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) anxiety by an assurance of activity in the matter. But
the prospect was so grand that it had excited even him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had money
sufficient for carrying out the scheme, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) delayed the matter
now, it might well be that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would never again find himself so
circumstanced. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would ask somebody whither he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ought
to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), and what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ought to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>);--and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would
then make the proposition to herself. Miles Grendall would be the
man to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>), because, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) faults, Miles did understand
things. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) could not ask Miles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) and Nidderdale were good
friends; but Nidderdale wanted the girl for himself. Grasslough would
be sure to tell Nidderdale. Dolly would be altogether useless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
thought that, perhaps, Herr Vossner would be the man to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>).
There would be no difficulty out of which Herr Vossner would not
extricate <div class="bookquote">``a fellow,'' (<font color='red'><b>Herr Vossner/Vossner</b></font>)</div>--if <div class="bookquote">``the fellow''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Vossner/Vossner</b></font>)</div>paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>).

<p/>On Thursday evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) went to Grosvenor Square, as desired by
Marie,--but unfortunately found Melmotte in the drawing-room. Lord
Nidderdale was there also, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) lordship's old father, the Marquis
of Auld Reekie, whom Felix, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) entered the room, did not know.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) was a fierce-looking, gouty old man, with watery eyes, and very
stiff grey hair,--almost white. He (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) was standing up supporting himself
on two sticks when Sir Felix entered the room. There were also
present Madame Melmotte, Miss Longestaffe, and Marie. As Felix had
entered the hall one huge footman had said that the ladies were not
at home; then there had been for a moment a whispering behind a
door,--in which he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) afterwards conceived that Madame Didon had taken a
part;--and upon that a second tall footman had contradicted the first
and had ushered him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) up to the drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) felt considerably
embarrassed, but shook hands with the ladies, bowed to Melmotte, who
seemed to take no notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and nodded to Lord Nidderdale. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
had not had time to place himself, when the Marquis arranged things.
<div class="bookquote">``Suppose we go down-stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``I'll show your lordship the
way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis</b></font>)</div>The Marquis did not speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son, but poked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
stick, as though poking him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) out of the door. So instigated Nidderdale
followed the financier, and the gouty old Marquis toddled after them.

<p/>Madame Melmotte was beside herself with trepidation. <div class="bookquote">``You should not
have been made to come up at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Il faut que vous vous
retirez.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, looking quite aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that I had at any rate better retire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Longestaffe, raising herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) full height and stalking out of
the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Qu'elle est méchante,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Madame Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is so bad. Sir
Felix, you had better go too. Yes,--indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, running to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and taking hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) go? I want papa to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Il vous tuera,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Madame Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``My God, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover. <div class="bookquote">``I will never
marry Lord Nidderdale. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) were to cut me into bits I wouldn't do
it. Felix, you love me;--do you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, slipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) waist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, <div class="bookquote">``I will never have any other man but
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);--never, never, never. Oh, Felix, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) that you love me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that, don't you, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix was a little troubled in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should say, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, love! It is a beastliness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Madame Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``Sir Felix,
you had better go. Yes, indeed. Will you be so obliging?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. <div class="bookquote">``No, mamma, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shan't go. What has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be
afraid of? I will walk down among them into papa's room, and say that
I will never marry that man, and that this is my lover. Felix, will
you come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix did not quite like the proposition. There had been a
savage ferocity in that Marquis's eye, and there was habitually a
heavy sternness about Melmotte, which together made him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) resist the
invitation. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I have a right to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``because it is Mr. Melmotte's own house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. <div class="bookquote">``I told papa to-day that I wouldn't
marry Lord Nidderdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) angry with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) laughed at me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) manages people till he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) thinks that everybody
must do exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) tells them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) may kill me, but I will not do
it. I have quite made up my mind. Felix, if you will be true to me,
nothing shall separate us. I will not be ashamed to tell everybody
that I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Melmotte had now thrown herself into a chair and was sighing.
Sir Felix stood on the rug with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) arm round Marie's waist,
listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) protestations, but saying little in answer to
them,--when, suddenly, a heavy step was heard ascending the stairs.
<div class="bookquote">``C'est lui,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>screamed Madame Melmotte, bustling up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) seat and
hurrying out of the room by a side door. The two lovers were alone
for one moment, during which Marie lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) face, and Sir Felix
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Now be brave,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said, escaping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) arm,
<div class="bookquote">``and I'll be brave.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Melmotte looked round the room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
entered. <div class="bookquote">``Where are the others?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma has gone away, and Miss Longestaffe went before mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Felix, it is well that I should tell you that my daughter is
engaged to marry Lord Nidderdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Felix, I am not engaged--to--marry Lord Nidderdale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.
<div class="bookquote">``It's no good, papa. I won't do it. If you chop me to pieces, I won't
do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) will marry Lord Nidderdale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Melmotte, addressing
himself to Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``As that is arranged, you will perhaps think it
better to leave us. I shall be happy to renew my acquaintance with
you as soon as the fact is recognised;--or happy to see you in the
city at any time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is my lover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not pooh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is. I will never have any other. I hate Lord

me, papa, you would not want to make me unhappy all my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father walked up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) rapidly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand raised, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
clung only the closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover's arm. At this moment Sir Felix
did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might best do, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thoroughly wished himself
out in the square. <div class="bookquote">``Jade!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, <div class="bookquote">``get to your room.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Get to your room.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I will go to bed, if you tell me, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do tell you. How dare you take hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) in that way before me!
Have you no idea of disgrace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not disgraced. It is not more disgraceful to love him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) than that
other man. Oh, papa, don't. You hurt me. I am going.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) by
the arm and dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to the door, and then thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry, Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, <div class="bookquote">``to have had a hand
in causing this disturbance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away, and don't come back any more;--that's all. You can't both
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). All you have got to understand is this. I'm not the man to
give my daughter a single shilling if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marries against my consent.
By the God that hears me, Sir Felix, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) shall not have one shilling.
But look you,--if you'll give this up, I shall be proud to co-operate
with you in anything you may wish to have done in the city.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>After this Sir Felix left the room, went down the stairs, had the
door opened for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and was ushered into the square. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
went through the hall a woman managed to shove a note into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
hand,--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) read as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found himself under a gas lamp. It
was dated that morning, and had therefore no reference to the fray
which had just taken place. It ran as follows:--


<p/>I hope you will come to-night. There is something I cannot
tell you then, but you ought to know it. When we were in
France papa thought it wise to settle a lot of money on
me. I don't know how much, but I suppose it was enough to
live on if other things went wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) never talked to
me about it, but I know it was done. And it hasn't been
undone, and can't be without my leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is very angry
about you this morning, for I told him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) I would never give
you up. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) won't give me anything if I marry
without his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) leave. But I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) cannot take it away. I
tell you, because I think I ought to tell you everything.

<p/>M.


<p/>Sir Felix as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) read this could not but think that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had become
engaged to a very enterprising young lady. It was evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
did not care to what extent she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) braved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father on behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
lover, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) coolly proposed to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). But Sir Felix saw no
reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should not take advantage of the money made over to the
girl's name, if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could lay his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hands on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) did not know much of
such transactions, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knew more than Marie Melmotte, and could
understand that a man in Melmotte's position should want to secure
a portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune against accidents, by settling it on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
daughter. Whether having so settled it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could again resume it
without the daughter's assent, Sir Felix did not know. Marie, who
had no doubt been regarded as an absolutely passive instrument when
the thing was done, was now quite alive to the benefit which she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
might possibly derive from it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) proposition, put into plain
English, amounted to this: <div class="bookquote">``Take me and marry me without my father's
consent,--and then you and I together can rob my father of the money
which, for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own purposes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has settled upon me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had looked
upon the lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) choice as a poor weak thing, without any special
character of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own, who was made worthy of consideration only by
the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a rich man's daughter; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began to
loom before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes as something bigger than that. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had had a
will of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own when the mother had none. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not been afraid of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brutal father when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), Sir Felix, had trembled before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
had offered to be beaten, and killed, and chopped to pieces on behalf
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) lover. There could be no doubt about her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) running away if she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
were asked.

<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) that within the last month he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had gained a great
deal of experience, and that things which heretofore had been
troublesome to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), or difficult, or perhaps impossible, were now
coming easily within his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) reach. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had won two or three thousand
pounds at cards, whereas invariable loss had been the result of
the small play in which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had before indulged. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had been set to
marry this heiress, having at first no great liking for the attempt,
because of its difficulties and the small amount of hope which it
offered him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). The girl was already willing and anxious to jump into
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arms. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had detected a man cheating at cards,--an extent
of iniquity that was awful to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had seen it,--and was
already beginning to think that there was not very much in that. If
there was not much in it, if such a man as Miles Grendall could cheat
at cards and be brought to no punishment, why should not he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) try it?
It was a rapid way of winning, no doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered that on one or
two occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adversary to cut the cards a second
time at whist, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had observed that there was no honour at
the bottom. No feeling of honesty had interfered with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The little
trick had hardly been premeditated, but when successful without
detection had not troubled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conscience. Now it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that
much more than that might be done without detection. But nothing
had opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes to the ways of the world so widely as the sweet
little lover-like proposition made by Miss Melmotte for robbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
father. It certainly recommended the girl to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been able
at an early age, amidst the circumstances of a very secluded life,
to throw off from her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) altogether those scruples of honesty, those
bugbears of the world, which are apt to prevent great enterprises in
the minds of men.

<p/>What should he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) do next? This sum of money of which Marie wrote so
easily was probably large. It would not have been worth the while
of such a man as Mr. Melmotte to make a trifling provision of this
nature. It could hardly be less than #50,000,--might probably be
very much more. But this was certain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and Marie
were to claim this money as man and wife, there could then be no
hope of further liberality. It was not probable that such a man
as Mr. Melmotte would forgive even an only child such an offence
as that. Even if it were obtained, #50,000 would not be very much.
And Melmotte might probably have means, even if the robbery were
duly perpetrated, of making the possession of the money very
uncomfortable. These were deep waters into which Sir Felix was
preparing to plunge; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not feel himself to be altogether
comfortable, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) liked the deep waters.




<p/>CHAPTER XXX.

<p/>MR. MELMOTTE``S PROMISE.


<p/>On the following Saturday there appeared in Mr. Alf's paper, the
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>a very remarkable article on the South Central
Pacific and Mexican Railway. It was an article that attracted a great
deal of attention and was therefore remarkable, but it was in nothing
more remarkable than in this,--that it left on the mind of its reader
no impression of any decided opinion about the railway. The Editor
would at any future time be able to refer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) article with equal
pride whether the railway should become a great cosmopolitan fact,
or whether it should collapse amidst the foul struggles of a horde
of swindlers. In utrumque paratus, the article was mysterious,
suggestive, amusing, well-informed,--that in the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was a matter of course,--and, above all things, ironical. Next to
its omniscience its irony was the strongest weapon belonging to
the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>There was a little praise given, no doubt in
irony, to the duchesses who served Mr. Melmotte. There was a little
praise, given of course in irony, to Mr. Melmotte's Board of English
Directors. There was a good deal of praise, but still alloyed by a
dash of irony, bestowed on the idea of civilising Mexico by joining
it to California. Praise was bestowed upon England for taking up the
matter, but accompanied by some ironical touches at her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) incapacity
to believe thoroughly in any enterprise not originated by herself.
Then there was something said of the universality of Mr. Melmotte's
commercial genius, but whether said in a spirit prophetic of ultimate
failure and disgrace, or of heavenborn success and unequalled
commercial splendour, no one could tell.

<p/>It was generally said at the clubs that Mr. Alf had written this
article himself. Old Splinter, who was one of a body of men
possessing an excellent cellar of wine and calling themselves Paides
Pallados, and who had written for the heavy quarterlies any time this
last forty years, professed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) saw through the article. The
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) explained, desirous of going as far as
it could in denouncing Mr. Melmotte without incurring the danger of
an action for libel. Mr. Splinter thought that the thing was clever
but mean. These new publications generally were mean. Mr. Splinter
was constant in that opinion; but, putting the meanness aside,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Splinter</b></font>) thought that the article was well done. According to his (<font color='blue'><b>Splinter</b></font>) view
it was intended to expose Mr. Melmotte and the railway. But the
Paides Pallados generally did not agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Under such an
interpretation, what had been the meaning of that paragraph in which
the writer had declared that the work of joining one ocean to another
was worthy of the nearest approach to divinity that had been granted
to men? Old Splinter chuckled and gabbled as he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) heard this, and
declared that there was not wit enough left now even among the Paides
Pallados to understand a shaft of irony. There could be no doubt,
however, at the time, that the world did not go with old Splinter,
and that the article served to enhance the value of shares in the
great railway enterprise.

<p/>Lady Carbury was sure that the article was intended to write up the
railway, and took great joy in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) entertained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) brain a
somewhat confused notion that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could only bestir herself in the
right direction and could induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son to open his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own
advantage, very great things might be achieved, so that wealth might
become his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) handmaid and luxury the habit and the right of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) life.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was the beloved and the accepted suitor of Marie Melmotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
a Director of this great company, sitting at the same board with the
great commercial hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was the handsomest young man in London. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was a baronet. Very wild ideas occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) take
Mr. Alf into her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) entire confidence? If Melmotte and Alf could be
brought together what might they not do? Alf could write up Melmotte,
and Melmotte could shower shares upon Alf. And if Melmotte would come
and be smiled upon by herself, be flattered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
could flatter him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a god, and have that passage
about the divinity of joining ocean to ocean construed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
could construe it, would not the great man become plastic under her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
hands? And if, while this was a-doing, Felix would run away with
Marie, could not forgiveness be made easy? And her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) creative mind
ranged still farther. Mr. Broune might help, and even Mr. Booker. To
such a one as Melmotte, a man doing great things through the force of
the confidence placed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) by the world at large, the freely-spoken
support of the Press would be everything. Who would not buy shares in
a railway as to which Mr. Broune and Mr. Alf would combine in saying
that it was managed by <div class="bookquote">``divinity'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) thoughts were rather hazy, but
from day to day she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) worked hard to make them clear to herself.

<p/>On the Sunday afternoon Mr. Booker called on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) and talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
about the article. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did not say much to Mr. Booker as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own
connection with Mr. Melmotte, telling herself that prudence was
essential in the present emergency. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) listened with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
ears. It was Mr. Booker's idea that the man was going <div class="bookquote">``to make a
spoon or spoil a horn.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You think him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) honest;--don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked
Lady Carbury. Mr. Booker smiled and hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I mean
honest as men can be in such very large transactions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps that is the best way of putting it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Booker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If a thing can be made great and beneficent, a boon to humanity,
simply by creating a belief in it, does not a man become a benefactor
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) race by creating that belief?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the expense of veracity?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Booker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the expense of anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>rejoined Lady Carbury with energy. <div class="bookquote">``One
cannot measure such men by the ordinary rule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would do evil to produce good?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Booker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not call it doing evil. You have to destroy a thousand living
creatures every time you drink a glass of water, but you do not think
of that when you are athirst. You cannot send a ship to sea without
endangering lives. You do send ships to sea though men perish yearly.
You tell me this man may perhaps ruin hundreds, but then again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may
create a new world in which millions will be rich and happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an excellent casuist, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am an enthusiastic lover of beneficent audacity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Carbury, picking her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) words slowly, and showing herself to be quite
satisfied with herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) picked them. <div class="bookquote">``Did I hold your place,
Mr. Booker, in the literature of my country,--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hold no place, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--and a very distinguished place. Were I circumstanced as you
are I should have no hesitation in lending the whole weight of my
periodical, let it be what it might, to the assistance of so great
a man and so great an object as this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be dismissed to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Booker</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Booker, getting up
and laughing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) departure. Lady Carbury felt that, as
regarded Mr. Booker, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had only thrown out a chance word that
could not do any harm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not expected to effect much through
Mr. Booker's instrumentality. On the Tuesday evening,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) regular
Tuesday as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) called it,--all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) three editors came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
drawing-room; but there came also a greater man than either of them.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had taken the bull by the horns, and without saying anything to
anybody had written to Mr. Melmotte himself, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to honour her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
poor house with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) presence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had written a very pretty note to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) of their meeting at Caversham, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that
on a former occasion Madame Melmotte and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) daughter had been so
kind as to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to understand that of all the
potentates now on earth he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was the one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could bow the knee
with the purest satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wrote back,--or Miles Grendall did
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>),--a very plain note, accepting the honour of Lady Carbury's
invitation.

<p/>The great man came, and Lady Carbury took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) immediate
wing with a grace that was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said a word about their
dear friends at Caversham, expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sorrow that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son's
engagements did not admit of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) being there, and then with the
utmost audacity rushed off to the article in the <div class="bookquote">``Pulpit.''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
friend, Mr. Alf, the editor, had thoroughly appreciated the greatness
of Mr. Melmotte's character, and the magnificence of Mr. Melmotte's
undertakings. Mr. Melmotte bowed and muttered something that was
inaudible. <div class="bookquote">``Now I must introduce you to Mr. Alf,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.
The introduction was effected, and Mr. Alf explained that it was
hardly necessary, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) had already been entertained as one of Mr.
Melmotte's guests.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There were a great many there I never saw, and probably never shall
see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was one of the unfortunates,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Alf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry you were unfortunate. If you had come into the whist-room
you would have found me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,--if I had but known!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Alf. The editor, as was proper,
carried about with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) samples of the irony which his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) paper used so
effectively, but it was altogether thrown away upon Melmotte.

<p/>Lady Carbury finding that no immediate good results could be expected
from this last introduction, tried another. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said,
whispering to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), ``I do so want to make you known to Mr. Broune. Mr.
Broune I know you have never met before. A morning paper is a much
heavier burden to an editor than one published in the afternoon. Mr.
Broune, as of course you know, manages the ``Breakfast Table.<div class="bookquote">'' There
is hardly a more influential man in London than Mr. Broune. And
they declare, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, lowering the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) whisper
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) communicated the fact, <div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) commercial articles are
gospel,--absolutely gospel.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then the two men were named to each
other, and Lady Carbury retreated;--but not out of hearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Getting very hot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very hot indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was over 70 in the city to-day. I call that very hot for June.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very hot indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune again. Then the conversation was
over. Mr. Broune sidled away, and Mr. Melmotte was left standing in
the middle of the room. Lady Carbury told herself at the moment that
Rome was not built in a day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would have been better satisfied
certainly if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could have laid a few more bricks on this day.
Perseverance, however, was the thing wanted.

<p/>But Mr. Melmotte himself had a word to say, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) left
the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said it. <div class="bookquote">``It was very good of you to ask me, Lady
Carbury;--very good.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury intimated her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) opinion that the
goodness was all on the other side. <div class="bookquote">``And I came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>continued Mr.
Melmotte, <div class="bookquote">``because I had something particular to say. Otherwise
I don't go out much to evening parties. Your son has proposed to
my daughter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
eyes;--clasped both her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hands together; and then, having unclasped
them, put one upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sleeve. <div class="bookquote">``My daughter, ma'am, is engaged to
another man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not enslave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) affections, Mr. Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a shilling if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marries any one else; that's all.
You reminded me down at Caversham that your son is a Director at our
Board.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did;--I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a great respect for your son, ma'am. I don't want to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
in any way. If he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'ll signify to my daughter that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) withdraws from
this offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), because I'm against it, I'll see that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) does
uncommon well in the city. I'll be the making of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). Good night,
ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Melmotte took his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) departure without another word.

<p/>Here at any rate was an undertaking on the part of the great man
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be the <div class="bookquote">``making of Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>if Felix would only obey
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--accompanied, or rather preceded, by a most positive assurance
that if Felix were to succeed in marrying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not
give his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son-in-law a shilling! There was very much to be considered
in this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did not doubt that Felix might be <div class="bookquote">``made''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>by Mr.
Melmotte's city influences, but then any perpetuity of such making
must depend on qualifications in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) son which she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did
not possess. The wife without the money would be terrible! That would
be absolute ruin! There could be no escape then; no hope. There was
an appreciation of real tragedy in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) contemplated
the position of Sir Felix married to such a girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) supposed
Marie Melmotte to be, without any means of support for either of
them but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could supply. It would kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). And for those
young people there would be nothing before them, but beggary and the
workhouse. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) trembled with true maternal
instincts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) beautiful boy,--so glorious with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) outward gifts,
so fit, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), for all the graces of the grand world!
Though the ambition was vilely ignoble, the mother's love was noble
and disinterested.

<p/>But the girl was an only child. The future honours of the house
of Melmotte could be made to settle on no other head. No doubt
the father would prefer a lord for a son-in-law; and, having that
preference, would of course do as he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) was now doing. That he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) should
threaten to disinherit his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) daughter if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) married contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>)
wishes was to be expected. But would it not be equally a matter of
course that he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) should make the best of the marriage if it were once
effected? His (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) daughter would return to him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) with a title, though
with one of a lower degree than his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) ambition desired. To herself
personally, Lady Carbury felt that the great financier had been very
rude. He (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) had taken advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) invitation that he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) might come to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) house and threaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would forgive that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could
pass that over altogether if only anything were to be gained by
passing it over.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) looked round the room, longing for a friend, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might
consult with a true feeling of genuine womanly dependence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) most
natural friend was Roger Carbury. But even had he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) been there she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
could not have consulted him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) on any matter touching the Melmottes.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) advice would have been very clear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to have
nothing at all to do with such adventurers. But then dear Roger was
old fashioned, and knew nothing of people as they are now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) lived
in a world which, though slow, had been good in its way; but which,
whether bad or good, had now passed away. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eye settled on
Mr. Broune. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was afraid of Mr. Alf. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had almost begun to think
that Mr. Alf was too difficult of management to be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). But
Mr. Broune was softer. Mr. Booker was serviceable for an article,
but would not be sympathetic as a friend. Mr. Broune had been very
courteous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lately;--so much so that on one occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
almost feared that the <div class="bookquote">``susceptible old goose''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was going to be a
goose again. That would be a bore; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might make use
of the friendly condition of mind which such susceptibility would
produce. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) guests began to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) spoke a word aside
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) advice. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) stay for a few minutes after
the rest of the company? He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) did stay, and when all the others were
gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter to leave them. <div class="bookquote">``Hetta,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have
something of business to communicate to Mr. Broune.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And so they were
left alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you didn't make much of Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said smiling.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had seated himself on the end of a sofa, close to the arm-chair
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) occupied. In reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) only shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) head and laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``I saw how it was, and I was sorry for it; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) certainly is a
wonderful man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is one of those men whose powers do not lie,
I should say, chiefly in conversation. Though, indeed, there is no
reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should not say the same of me;--for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said little,
I said less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It didn't just come off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury suggested with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sweetest
smile. <div class="bookquote">``But now I want to tell you something. I think I am justified
in regarding you as a real friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) hand for hers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) for a moment, and then took it back
again,--finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) did not relinquish it of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) own accord.
<div class="bookquote">``Stupid old goose!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``And now to my story. You
know my boy, Felix?''  (<font color='red'><b>The editor</b></font>)</div>The editor nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is engaged to
marry that man's daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Engaged to marry Miss Melmotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Then Lady Carbury nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is said to be the greatest heiress that the world has ever
produced. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was to marry Lord Nidderdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has engaged herself to Felix. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) is desperately in love with

(<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) tried to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) story truly, knowing
that no advice can be worth anything that is not based on a true

her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to marry the lord. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) came here to tell me that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) daughter
married Felix she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) should not have a penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) volunteered that,--as a threat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had come here simply with the

it as we get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be sure to make some such threat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. That is just what I feel. And in these days young people
are not often kept from marrying simply by a father's fantasy. But I
must tell you something else. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me that if Felix would desist,
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to make a fortune in the city.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's bosh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Broune with decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think it must be so;--certainly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. Such an undertaking, if intended by Melmotte, would give

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did very wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must have spoken with the purpose of

likely to interfere with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). It may be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) will be able to sell

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Broune hesitated before he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) replied to this question. But it was
to this question that Lady Carbury especially wished for a reply.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wanted some one to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) under the circumstances of an
elopement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) chair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) rose at the same time.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I should have begun by saying that Felix is all but prepared
to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) is quite ready to go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) is devoted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Do
you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a question very hard to answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People do it every day. Lionel Goldsheiner ran away the other day

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, people do run away, and it all comes right. It was the

didn't like it, so the mother had it done in that fashion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say there would;--but nevertheless it is one of those

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXI.

<p/>MR. BROUNE HAS MADE UP HIS (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) MIND.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I have something to say to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>Mr. Broune as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) thus spoke
to Lady Carbury rose up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) feet and then sat down again. There
was an air of perturbation about him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) which was very manifest to the
lady, and the cause and coming result of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
understood. <div class="bookquote">``The susceptible old goose is going to do something
highly ridiculous and very disagreeable.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was thus that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke
to herself of the scene that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw was prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
did not foresee accurately the shape in which the susceptibility
of the <div class="bookquote">``old goose''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>would declare itself. <div class="bookquote">``Lady Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Broune, standing up a second time, <div class="bookquote">``we are neither of us so young as
we used to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed;--and therefore it is that we can afford to ourselves the
luxury of being friends. Nothing but age enables men and women to
know each other intimately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div><p/>This speech was a great impediment to Mr. Broune's progress. It was
evidently intended to imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) at least had reached a time of
life at which any allusion to love would be absurd. And yet, as a
fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was nearer fifty than sixty, was young of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) age, could
walk his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) four or five miles pleasantly, could ride his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) cob in the
park with as free an air as any man of forty, and could afterwards
work through four or five hours of the night with an easy steadiness
which nothing but sound health could produce. Mr. Broune, thinking of
himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) own circumstances, could see no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) should
not be in love. <div class="bookquote">``I hope we know each other intimately at any rate,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said somewhat lamely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes;--and it is for that reason that I have come to you for
advice. Had I been a young woman I should not have dared to ask you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that. I don't quite understand that. But it has nothing
to do with my present purpose. When I said that we were neither of us
so young as we once were, I uttered what was a stupid platitude,--a
foolish truism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or would have been, only that I intended something further.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Broune had got himself into a difficulty and hardly knew how to get
out of it. <div class="bookquote">``I was going on to say that I hoped we were not too old
to--love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Foolish old darling! What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) mean by making such an ass of
himself? This was worse even than the kiss, as being more troublesome
and less easily pushed on one side and forgotten. It may serve to
explain the condition of Lady Carbury's mind at the time if it be
stated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not even at this moment suppose that the editor
of the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>intended to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) an offer of
marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew, or thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew, that middle-aged men are
fond of prating about love, and getting up sensational scenes. The
falseness of the thing, and the injury which may come of it, did
not shock her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at all. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) known that the editor professed to
be in love with some lady in the next street, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have been
quite ready to enlist the lady in the next street among her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friends
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might thus strengthen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own influence with Mr. Broune.
For herself such make-belief of an improper passion would be
inconvenient, and therefore to be avoided. But that any man, placed
as Mr. Broune was in the world,--blessed with power, with a large
income, with influence throughout all the world around him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>), courted,
fêted, feared and almost worshipped,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) should desire to
share her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fortunes, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) misfortunes, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) struggles, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poverty and
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) obscurity, was not within the scope of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) imagination. There
was a homage in it, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not believe any man to be
capable,--and which to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be the more wonderful as being paid
to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought so badly of men and women generally, and of
Mr. Broune and herself as a man and a woman individually, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was unable to conceive the possibility of such a sacrifice. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Broune,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I did not think that you would take advantage of
the confidence I have placed in you to annoy me in this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To annoy you, Lady Carbury! The phrase at any rate is singular.
After much thought I have determined to ask you to be my wife. That
I should be--annoyed, and more than annoyed by your refusal, is a
matter of course. That I ought to expect such annoyance is perhaps
too true. But you can extricate yourself from the dilemma only too
easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The word <div class="bookquote">``wife''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) like a thunder-clap. It at once changed
all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not dream of loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never could love him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). Had it been on the
cards with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to love any man as a lover, it would have been some
handsome spendthrift who would have hung from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck like a nether
millstone. This man was a friend to be used,--to be used because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knew the world. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) this clear testimony that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew
as little of the world as any other man. Mr. Broune of the <div class="bookquote">``Daily
Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>asking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) wife! But mixed with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other
feelings there was a tenderness which brought back some memory of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) distant youth, and almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) weep. That a man,--such a
man,--should offer to take half her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) burdens, and to confer upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
half his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blessings! What an idiot! But what a God! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had looked
upon the man as all intellect, alloyed perhaps by some passionless
remnants of the vices of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youth; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not
only had a human heart in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom, but a heart that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could
touch. How wonderfully sweet! How infinitely small!

<p/>It was necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should answer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--and to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) it was only
natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should at first think what answer would best assist
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own views without reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but it did occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might lift her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) difficulties. What a benefit it would be to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to have a
father, and such a father, for Felix! How easy would be a literary
career to the wife of the editor of the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>And then it passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind that somebody had told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that
the man was paid #3,000 a year for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work. Would not the world, or
any part of it that was desirable, come to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drawing-room if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
were the wife of Mr. Broune? It all passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brain at once
during that minute of silence which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) allowed herself after the
declaration was made to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). But other ideas and other feelings were
present to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) also. Perhaps the truest aspiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart had
been the love of freedom which the tyranny of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) late husband had
engendered. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had fled from that tyranny and had been almost
crushed by the censure to which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been subjected. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
husband's protection and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tyranny had been restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). After
that the freedom had come. It had been accompanied by many hopes
never as yet fulfilled, and embittered by many sorrows which had
been always present to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); but still the hopes were alive and the
remembrance of the tyranny was very clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). At last the minute
was over and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was bound to speak. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Broune,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you
have quite taken away my breath. I never expected anything of this
kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And now Mr. Broune's mouth was opened, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) voice was free. <div class="bookquote">``Lady
Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have lived a long time without marrying, and I
have sometimes thought that it would be better for me to go on in the
same way to the end. I have worked so hard all my life that when I
was young I had no time to think of love. And, as I have gone on,
my mind has been so fully employed, that I have hardly realised the
want which nevertheless I have felt. And so it has been with me till
I fancied, not that I was too old for love, but that others would
think me so. Then I met you. As I said at first, perhaps with scant
gallantry, you also are not as young as you once were. But you keep
the beauty of your youth, and the energy, and something of the
freshness of a young heart. And I have come to love you. I speak with
absolute frankness, risking your anger. I have doubted much before
I resolved upon this. It is so hard to know the nature of another
person. But I think I understand yours;--and if you can confide your
happiness with me, I am prepared to intrust mine to your keeping.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Poor Mr. Broune! Though endowed with gifts peculiarly adapted for the
editing of a daily newspaper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) could have had but little capacity
for reading a woman's character when he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) talked of the freshness of
Lady Carbury's young mind! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) must have surely been much blinded
by love, before convincing himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) could trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) happiness
to such keeping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do me infinite honour. You pay me a great compliment,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I to answer you at a moment? I expected nothing of this. As
God is to be my judge it has come upon me like a dream. I look upon
your position as almost the highest in England,--on your prosperity
as the uttermost that can be achieved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That prosperity, such as it is, I desire most anxiously to share
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You tell me so;--but I can hardly yet believe it. And then how am I
to know my own feelings so suddenly? Marriage as I have found it, Mr.
Broune, has not been happy. I have suffered much. I have been wounded
in every joint, hurt in every nerve,--tortured till I could hardly
endure my punishment. At last I got my liberty, and to that I have
looked for happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it made you happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has made me less wretched. And there is so much to be considered!
I have a son and a daughter, Mr. Broune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your daughter I can love as my own. I think I prove my devotion
to you when I say that I am willing for your sake to encounter the
troubles which may attend your son's future career.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Broune, I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) better,--always shall love him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) better,--than
anything in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>This was calculated to damp the lover's
ardour, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) probably reflected that should he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) now be successful,
time might probably change the feeling which had just been expressed.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Broune,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am now so agitated that you had better
leave me. And it is very late. The servant is sitting up, and will
wonder that you should remain. It is near two o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When may I hope for an answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall not be kept waiting. I will write to you, almost at once.
I will write to you,--to-morrow; say the day after to-morrow, on
Thursday. I feel that I ought to have been prepared with an answer;
but I am so surprised that I have none ready.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand in
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), and kissing it, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) without another word.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was about to open the front door to let himself out, a key
from the other side raised the latch, and Sir Felix, returning from
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) club, entered his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mother's house. The young man looked up into
Mr. Broune's face with mingled impudence and surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Halloo, old
fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you've been keeping it up late here; haven't
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was nearly drunk, and Mr. Broune, perceiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) condition,
passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) without a word. Lady Carbury was still standing in the
drawing-room, struck with amazement at the scene which had just
passed, full of doubt as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) future conduct, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
son stumbling up the stairs. It was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) not to go out
to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``why do you make so much noise as you come
in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Noish! I'm not making any noish. I think I'm very early. Your
people's only just gone. I shaw shat editor fellow at the door that
won't call himself Brown. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)`sh great ass`h, that fellow. All right,
mother. Oh, ye`sh I'm all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) stumbled up to bed, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother followed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to see that the candle was at any rate placed
squarely on the table, beyond the reach of the bed curtains.

<p/>Mr. Broune as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) walked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) newspaper office experienced all those
pangs of doubts which a man feels when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has just done that which
for days and weeks past he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has almost resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had better
leave undone. That last apparition which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had encountered at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lady love's door certainly had not tended to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What curse
can be much greater than that inflicted by a drunken, reprobate son?
The evil, when in the course of things it comes upon a man, has to
be borne; but why should a man in middle life unnecessarily afflict
himself with so terrible a misfortune? The woman, too, was devoted to
the cub! Then thousands of other thoughts crowded upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). How would
this new life suit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have a new house, and new ways; must
live under a new dominion, and fit himself to new pleasures. And what
was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to gain by it? Lady Carbury was a handsome woman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) beauty. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) too as a clever woman; and, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been long
enough about town to have known better,--and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now walked along
the streets, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have known better. Every
now and again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) warmed himself a little with the remembrance of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) beauty, and told himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new home would be pleasanter,
though it might perhaps be less free, than the old one. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to
make the best of it; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so was always repressed by the
memory of the appearance of that drunken young baronet.

<p/>Whether for good or for evil, the step had been taken and the thing
was done. It did not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the lady would refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
All his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) experience of the world was against such refusal. Towns
which consider, always render themselves. Ladies who doubt always
solve their doubts in the one direction. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would accept
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);--and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would stand to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guns. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
work he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) endeavoured to bathe himself in self-complacency; but, at the
bottom of it, there was a substratum of melancholy which leavened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
prospects.

<p/>Lady Carbury went from the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son's room to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own chamber,
and there sat thinking through the greater part of the night.
During these hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) perhaps became a better woman, as being more
oblivious of herself, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been for many a year. It could not
be for the good of this man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did in
the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) many troubles try to think of the man's condition.
Although in the moments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) triumph,--and such moments were
many,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would buoy herself up with assurances that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) Felix
would become a rich man, brilliant with wealth and rank, an honour
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), a personage whose society would be desired by many, still
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heart of hearts she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew how great was the peril, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
imagination she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could foresee the nature of the catastrophe which
might come. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go utterly to the dogs and would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And whithersoever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might go, to what lowest canine regions he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
might descend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew herself well enough to be sure that whether
married or single she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) reason might be
ever so strong in bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to desert him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew,
would be stronger than her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the one thing in the world
that overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). In all other matters she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could scheme, and
contrive, and pretend; could get the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) feelings and fight
the world with a double face, laughing at illusions and telling
herself that passions and preferences were simply weapons to be used.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son mastered her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew it. As it was
so, could it be fit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should marry another man?

<p/>And then her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) liberty! Even though Felix should bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to utter
ruin, nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would be and might remain a free woman. Should
the worse come to the worst she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could endure a
Bohemian life in which, should all her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) means have been taken from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could live on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) earned. Though Felix was a tyrant
after a kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) was not a tyrant who could bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) do this or that.
A repetition of marriage vows did not of itself recommend itself to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). As to loving the man, liking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caresses, and being specially
happy because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>),--no romance of that kind ever
presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) imagination. How would it affect Felix and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) together,--and Mr. Broune as connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) and Felix? If
Felix should go to the dogs, then would Mr. Broune not want her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).
Should Felix go to the stars instead of the dogs, and become one of
the gilded ornaments of the metropolis, then would not he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
want Mr. Broune. It was thus that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) regarded the matter.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) thought very little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) daughter as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) considered all this.
There was a home for Hetta, with every comfort, if Hetta would only
condescend to accept it. Why did not Hetta marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) cousin Roger
Carbury and let there be an end of that trouble? Of course Hetta
must live wherever her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mother lived till she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) should marry; but
Hetta's life was so much at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own disposal that her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mother did
not feel herself bound to be guided in the great matter by Hetta's
predispositions.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) must tell Hetta should she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) ultimately make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind to
marry the man, and in that case the sooner this was done the better.
On that night she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did not make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind. Ever and again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
declared to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the picture of a
comfortable assured home over her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) head, and the conviction that the
editor of the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>would be powerful for all
things, brought new doubts to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could not convince
herself, and when at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) bed her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind was still
vacillating. The next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) met Hetta at breakfast, and with
assumed nonchalance asked a question about the man who was perhaps
about to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Do you like Mr. Broune, Hetta?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--pretty well. I don't care very much about him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). What makes you
ask, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because among my acquaintances in London there is no one so truly
kind to me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) always seems to me to like to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) has to me that air of selfishness which is so very common with
people in London;--as though what he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said were all said out of
surface politeness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what you expect, Hetta, when you talk of--London people?
Why should not London people be as kind as other people? I think Mr.
Broune is as obliging a man as any one I know. But if I like anybody,
you always make little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). The only person you seem to think well
of is Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, that is unfair and unkind. I never mention Mr. Montague's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXII.

<p/>LADY MONOGRAM.


<p/>Georgiana Longestaffe had now been staying with the Melmottes for
a fortnight, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) prospects in regard to the London season had
not much improved. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) brother had troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) no further, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
family at Caversham had not, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was aware, taken any
notice of Dolly's interference. Twice a week she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) received a cold,
dull letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mother,--such letters as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had been accustomed
to receive when away from home; and these she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had answered, always
endeavouring to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sheet with some customary description of
fashionable doings, with some bit of scandal such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would have
repeated for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) mother's amusement,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own delectation in the
telling of it,--had there been nothing painful in the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)
sojourn in London. Of the Melmottes she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) hardly spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did not
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was taken to the houses in which it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) ambition to
be seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would have lied directly in saying so. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did not
announce her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own disappointment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had chosen to come up to the
Melmottes in preference to remaining at Caversham, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would not
declare her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) own failure. <div class="bookquote">``I hope they are kind to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>Lady Pomona
always said. But Georgiana did not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother whether the
Melmottes were kind or unkind.

<p/>In truth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``season''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was a very unpleasant season. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mode of
living was altogether different to anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had already known.
The house in Bruton Street had never been very bright, but the
appendages of life there had been of a sort which was not known in
the gorgeous mansion in Grosvenor Square. It had been full of books
and little toys and those thousand trifling household gods which are
accumulated in years, and which in their accumulation suit themselves
to the taste of their owners. In Grosvenor Square there were no
Lares;--no toys, no books, nothing but gold and grandeur, pomatum,
powder and pride. The Longestaffe life had not been an easy, natural,
or intellectual life; but the Melmotte life was hardly endurable even
by a Longestaffe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had, however, come prepared to suffer much,
and was endowed with considerable power of endurance in pursuit of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own objects. Having willed to come, even to the Melmottes, in
preference to remaining at Caversham, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) fortified herself to suffer
much. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) have ridden in the park at mid-day in desirable
company, and found herself in proper houses at midnight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would
have borne the rest, bad as it might have been. But it was not
so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) horse, but could with difficulty get any proper
companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been in the habit of riding with one of the
Primero girls,--and old Primero would accompany them, or perhaps a
brother Primero, or occasionally her (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>) own father. And then, when once
out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>) would be surrounded by a cloud of young men,--and though
there was but little in it, a walking round and round the same bit
of ground with the same companions and with the smallest attempt at
conversation, still it had been the proper thing and had satisfied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>). Now it was with difficulty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>) could get any cavalier
such as the laws of society demand. Even Penelope Primero snubbed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>),--whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>), Georgiana Longestaffe, had hitherto endured and
snubbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was just allowed to join them when old Primero rode, and
was obliged even to ask for that assistance.

<p/>But the nights were still worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>) could only go where Madame
Melmotte went, and Madame Melmotte was more prone to receive
people at home than to go out. And the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>) did receive were
antipathetic to Miss Longestaffe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>) did not even know who they
were, whence they came, or what was their nature. They seemed to
be as little akin to her (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>) as would have been the shopkeepers in the
small town near Caversham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>) would sit through long evenings almost
speechless, trying to fathom the depth of the vulgarity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>)
associates. Occasionally she (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>) was taken out, and was then, probably,
taken to very grand houses. The two duchesses and the Marchioness
of Auld Reekie received Madame Melmotte, and the garden parties of
royalty were open to her (<font color='blue'><b>Primero</b></font>). And some of the most elaborate fêtes of
the season,--which indeed were very elaborate on behalf of this and
that travelling potentate,--were attained. On these occasions Miss
Longestaffe was fully aware of the struggle that was always made for
invitations, often unsuccessfully, but sometimes with triumph. Even
the bargains, conducted by the hands of Lord Alfred and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) mighty
sister, were not altogether hidden from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). The Emperor of China was
to be in London and it was thought proper that some private person,
some untitled individual, should give the Emperor a dinner, so that
the Emperor might see how an English merchant lives. Mr. Melmotte was
chosen on condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would spend #10,000 on the banquet;--and,
as a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) payment for this expenditure, was to be admitted
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) family, to a grand entertainment given to the Emperor at
Windsor Park. Of these good things Georgiana Longestaffe would
receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) share. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) went to them as a Melmotte and not as a
Longestaffe,--and when amidst these gaieties, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) could see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) old friends, she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was not with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was ever behind Madame
Melmotte, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) hated the make of that lady's garments and the
shape of that lady's back.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had told both her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father and mother very plainly that it behoved
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to be in London at this time of the year that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might--look for
a husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not hesitated in declaring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) purpose; and that
purpose, together with the means of carrying it out, had not appeared
to them to be unreasonable. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wanted to be settled in life. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
meant, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first started on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) career, to have a lord;--but
lords are scarce. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was herself not very highly born, not very
highly gifted, not very lovely, not very pleasant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had no
fortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had long made up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could do without a
lord, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must get a commoner of the proper sort. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) must
be a man with a place in the country and sufficient means to bring
him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) annually to London. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) must be a gentleman,--and, probably,
in parliament. And above all things he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) must be in the right set.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would rather go on for ever struggling than take some country
Whitstable as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister was about to do. But now the men of the
right sort never came near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The one object for which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
subjected herself to all this ignominy seemed to have vanished
altogether in the distance. When by chance she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) danced or exchanged a
few words with the Nidderdales and Grassloughs whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used to know,
they spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with a want of respect which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt and tasted
but could hardly analyse. Even Miles Grendall, who had hitherto
been below her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) notice, attempted to patronise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in a manner that
bewildered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). All this nearly broke her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart.

<p/>And then from time to time little rumours reached her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ears which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aware that, in the teeth of all Mr. Melmotte's social successes,
a general opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a gigantic swindler was rather gaining
ground than otherwise. <div class="bookquote">``Your host is a wonderful fellow, by George!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``No one seems to know which way he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll turn up
at last.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing like being a robber, if you can only rob
enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Lord Grasslough,--not exactly naming Melmotte, but
very clearly alluding to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). There was a vacancy for a member of
parliament at Westminster, and Melmotte was about to come forward
as a candidate. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) can manage that I think he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>)'ll pull through,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heard one man say. <div class="bookquote">``If money'll do it, it will be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said
another. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could understand it all. Mr. Melmotte was admitted into
society, because of some enormous power which was supposed to lie in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands; but even by those who thus admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was regarded
as a thief and a scoundrel. This was the man whose house had been
selected by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) search for a
husband from beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wing!

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) agony she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) old friend Julia Triplex, now the wife
of Sir Damask Monogram. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been really intimate with Julia
Triplex, and had been sympathetic when a brilliant marriage had been
achieved. Julia had been without fortune, but very pretty. Sir Damask
was a man of great wealth, whose father had been a contractor. But
Sir Damask himself was a sportsman, keeping many horses on which
other men often rode, a yacht in which other men sunned themselves, a
deer forest, a moor, a large machinery for making pheasants. He (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) shot
pigeons at Hurlingham, drove four-in-hand in the park, had a box at
every race-course, and was the most good-natured fellow known. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had
really conquered the world, had got over the difficulty of being the
grandson of a butcher, and was now as good as though the Monograms
had gone to the crusades. Julia Triplex was equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) position,
and made the very most of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) dispensed champagne and smiles, and
made everybody, including herself, believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) was in love with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) husband. Lady Monogram had climbed to the top of the tree, and
in that position had been, of course, invaluable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) old friend.
We must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) due and say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had been fairly true
to friendship while Georgiana--behaved herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) thought that
Georgiana in going to the Melmottes had--not behaved herself, and
therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had determined to drop Georgiana. <div class="bookquote">``Heartless, false,
purse-proud creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Georgiana said to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) wrote the
following letter in humiliating agony.


<p/>DEAR LADY MONOGRAM,

<p/>I think you hardly understand my position. Of course you
have cut me. Haven't you? And of course I must feel it
very much. You did not use to be ill-natured, and I hardly
think you can have become so now when you have everything
pleasant around you. I do not think that I have done
anything that should make an old friend treat me in this
way, and therefore I write to ask you to let me see you.
Of course it is because I am staying here. You know me
well enough to be sure that it can't be my own choice.
Papa arranged it all. If there is anything against these
people, I suppose papa does not know it. Of course they
are not nice. Of course they are not like anything that
I have been used to. But when papa told me that the house
in Bruton Street was to be shut up and that I was to come
here, of course I did as I was bid. I don't think an
old friend like you, whom I have always liked more than
anybody else, ought to cut me for it. It's not about the
parties, but about yourself that I mind. I don't ask
you to come here, but if you will see me I can have the
carriage and will go to you.

<p/>Yours, as ever,

<p/>GEORGIANA LONGESTAFFE.


<p/>It was a troublesome letter to get written. Lady Monogram was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) junior in age and had once been lower than herself in social
position. In the early days of their friendship she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had sometimes
domineered over Julia Triplex, and had been entreated by Julia, in
reference to balls here and routes there. The great Monogram marriage
had been accomplished very suddenly, and had taken place,--exalting
Julia very high,--just as Georgiana was beginning to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
aspirations to descend. It was in that very season that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) moved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) castle in the air from the Upper to the Lower House. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
was absolutely begging for notice, and praying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) might not be
cut! She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) letter by post and on the following day received a
reply, which was left by a footman.


<p/>DEAR GEORGIANA,

<p/>Of course I shall be delighted to see you. I don't know
what you mean by cutting. I never cut anybody. We happen
to have got into different sets, but that is not my fault.
Sir Damask won't let me call on the Melmottes. I can't
help that. You wouldn't have me go where he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) tells me not.
I don't know anything about them myself, except that I did
go to their ball. But everybody knows that's different.
I shall be at home all to-morrow till three,--that is
to-day I mean, for I'm writing after coming home from Lady
Killarney's ball; but if you wish to see me alone you had
better come before lunch.

<p/>Yours affectionately,

<p/>J. MONOGRAM.


<p/>Georgiana condescended to borrow the carriage and reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
friend's house a little after noon. The two ladies kissed each other
when they met--of course, and then Miss Longestaffe at once began.
<div class="bookquote">``Julia, I did think that you would at any rate have asked me to your
second ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you would have been asked if you had been up in Bruton

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say that you can't ask anybody to your house without

Damask to let me go. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says now that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) won't let me know them; and

understand anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monogram. <div class="bookquote">``People are going to see

gone,--only I suppose we shan't now because of this row.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by a row, Julia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--it is a row, and I hate rows. Going there when the Emperor
of China is there, or anything of that kind, is no more than going
to the play. Somebody chooses to get all London into his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) house, and
all London chooses to go. But it isn't understood that that means
acquaintance. I should meet Madame Melmotte in the park afterwards
and not think of bowing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should call that rude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Then we differ. But really it does seem to me that you

complain of people because they won't have the Melmottes crammed down
their throats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody has wanted it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana sobbing. At this moment
the door was opened, and Sir Damask came in. <div class="bookquote">``I'm talking to your
wife about the Melmottes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) continued, determined to take the

Damask, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands together, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyebrows, and
standing on the rug, looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had solved the whole
difficulty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) knows me, Sir Damask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) knows you. That's a matter of course. We're delighted

everything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've told her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) that you don't want me to go to the Melmottes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no;--not just to go there. Stay and have lunch, Miss

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you. I'm sorry that I have not been able to make you

<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII.

<p/>JOHN CRUMB.


<p/>Sir Felix Carbury made an appointment for meeting Ruby Ruggles a
second time at the bottom of the kitchen-garden belonging to Sheep's
Acre farm, which appointment he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) neglected, and had, indeed, made
without any intention of keeping it. But Ruby was there, and remained
hanging about among the cabbages till her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) grandfather returned from
Harlestone market. An early hour had been named; but hours may be
mistaken, and Ruby had thought that a fine gentleman, such as was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover, used to live among fine people up in London, might well
mistake the afternoon for the morning. If he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would come at all she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
could easily forgive such a mistake. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not come, and late in
the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was obliged to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) grandfather's summons as he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) into the house.

<p/>After that for three weeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) heard nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) London lover,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was always thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>);--and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could not
altogether avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) country lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) company as little
as possible. One afternoon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) grandfather returned from Bungay and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) country lover was coming to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``John Crumb
be a coming over by-and-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>a the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``See and have a bit o'
supper ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John Crumb coming here, grandfather? He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'s welcome to stay away then,
for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That be dommed.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old hat on to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and
seated himself in a wooden arm-chair that stood by the kitchen-fire.
Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was angry he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, and the custom was well

she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was well accustomed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) picked it up, and returned it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crumb</b></font>)</div><p/>In regard to the hospitality promised to Mr. Crumb, Miss Ruggles went
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) work with sufficient alacrity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) was quite willing that
the young man should have a supper, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) did understand that,
so far as the preparation of the supper went, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) service
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) grandfather. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) therefore went to work herself, and gave
directions to the servant girl who assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
grandfather's house. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did this, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
would make John Crumb understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would never be his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) wife.
Upon that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was now fully resolved. As she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went about the kitchen,
taking down the ham and cutting the slices that were to be broiled,
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) trussed the fowl that was to be boiled for John Crumb, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
made mental comparisons between him (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) and Sir Felix Carbury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could
see, as though present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at the moment, the mealy, floury head
of the one, with hair stiff with perennial dust from his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) sacks, and
the sweet glossy dark well-combed locks of the other, so bright,
so seductive, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was ever longing to twine her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) fingers among
them. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) remembered the heavy, flat, broad honest face of the
meal-man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) mouth slow in motion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) broad nose looking
like a huge white promontory, and his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) great staring eyes, from the
corners of which he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) was always extracting meal and grit;--and then
also she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) remembered the white teeth, the beautiful soft lips, the
perfect eyebrows, and the rich complexion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) London lover. Surely
a lease of Paradise with the one, though but for one short year,
would be well purchased at the price of a life with the other! <div class="bookquote">``It's
no good going against love,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``and I won't try.
He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) shall have his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) supper, and be told all about it, and then go home.
He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) cares more for his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) supper than he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) do for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then, with this
final resolution firmly made, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) popped the fowl into the pot. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
grandfather wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to leave Sheep's Acre. Very well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had a
little money of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own, and would take herself off to London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
knew what people would say, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cared nothing for old women's
tales. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would know how to take care of herself, and could always
say in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own defence that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) grandfather had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) out of
Sheep's Acre.

<p/>Seven had been the hour named, and punctually at that hour John
Crumb knocked at the back door of Sheep's Acre farm-house. Nor did
he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) come alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was accompanied by his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) friend Joe Mixet, the
baker of Bungay, who, as all Bungay knew, was to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) best man
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) marriage. John Crumb's character was not without many fine
attributes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) could earn money,--and having earned it could spend
and keep it in fair proportion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) was afraid of no work, and,--to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) due,--was afraid of no man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) was honest, and ashamed
of nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) did. And after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) fashion he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) had chivalrous ideas
about women. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) was willing to thrash any man that ill-used a woman,
and would certainly be a most dangerous antagonist to any man who
would misuse a woman belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But Ruby had told the truth of
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was slow of speech, and what the world calls
stupid in regard to all forms of expression. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew good meal from
bad as well as any man, and the price at which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could buy it so
as to leave himself a fair profit at the selling. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the value
of a clear conscience, and without much argument had discovered for
himself that honesty is in truth the best policy. Joe Mixet, who was
dapper of person and glib of tongue, had often declared that any one
buying John Crumb for a fool would lose his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) money. Joe Mixet was
probably right; but there had been a want of prudence, a lack of
worldly sagacity, in the way in which Crumb had allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) proposed
marriage with Ruby Ruggles to become a source of gossip to all
Bungay. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) love was now an old affair; and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) never talked
much, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) did talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) talked about that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) was proud of
Ruby's beauty, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) fortune, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) own status as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
acknowledged lover,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) did not hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) light under a bushel.
Perhaps the publicity so produced had some effect in prejudicing Ruby
against the man whose offer she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had certainly once accepted. Now when
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to settle the day,--having heard more than once or twice
that there was a difficulty with Ruby,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend Mixet
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as though to be present at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) triumph. <div class="bookquote">``If here isn't Joe
Mixet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby to herself. <div class="bookquote">``Was there ever such a stoopid as John
Crumb? There's no end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) being stoopid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man had slept off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beer while Ruby had been
preparing the feast, and now roused himself to entertain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guests.
<div class="bookquote">``What, Joe Mixet; is that thou? Thou`rt welcome. Come in, man. Well,
John, how is it wi' you? Ruby's a stewing o' something for us to
eat a bit. Don't 'e smell it?'' (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>--John Crumb lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great nose,
sniffed and grinned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John didn't like going home in the dark like,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baker</b></font>)</div>said the baker, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) little joke. <div class="bookquote">``So I just come along to drive away the bogies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The more the merrier;--the more the merrier. Ruby 'll have enough
for the two o' you, I'll go bail. So John Crumb's afraid of
bogies;--is he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)? The more need he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to have some `un in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) house to
scart 'em away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lover</b></font>)</div><p/>The lover had seated himself without speaking a word; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) was
instigated to ask a question. <div class="bookquote">``Where be she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>), Muster Ruggles?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man granddaughter</b></font>)</div>They
were seated in the outside or front kitchen, in which the old man
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) granddaughter always lived; while Ruby was at work in the
back kitchen. As John Crumb asked this question she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) could be heard
distinctly among the pots and the plates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) now came out, and
wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) apron, shook hands with the two young men.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had enveloped herself in a big household apron when the cooking
was in hand, and had not cared to take it off for the greeting of
this lover. <div class="bookquote">``Grandfather said as how you was a coming out for your
supper, so I've been a seeing to it. You'll excuse the apron, Mr.
Mixet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't look nicer, miss, if you was to try it ever so. My

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I loiks to see her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) loik o' that,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hands down
the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) trowsers, and stooping till he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eyes
down to a level with those of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sweetheart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks homely; don't it, John?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Mixet/Mixet/Joe</b></font>)</div>said Mixet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby, turning round sharp, and going back to the other
kitchen. John Crumb turned round also, and grinned at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) friend, and
then grinned at the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got it all afore you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer,--leaving the lover to
draw what lesson he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) might from this oracular proposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't care how soon I ha'e it in hond;--that I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said
John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the chat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Mixet/Mixet/Joe</b></font>)</div>said Joe Mixet. <div class="bookquote">``There ain't nothing wanting in
his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) house;--is there, John? It's all there,--cradle, caudle-cup, and
the rest of it. A young woman going to John knows what she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'ll have to
eat when she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gets up, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'ll lie down upon when she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) goes to
bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) declared in a loud voice for the benefit of Ruby in the
back kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) do,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John, grinning again. <div class="bookquote">``There's a hun`erd and
fifty poond o' things in my house forbye what mother left behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div><p/>After this there was no more conversation till Ruby reappeared with
the boiled fowl, and without her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) apron. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was followed by the girl
with a dish of broiled ham and an enormous pyramid of cabbage. Then
the old man got up slowly and opening some private little door of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breeches pocket, drew a jug of ale and
placed it on the table. And from a cupboard of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also kept the
key, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought out a bottle of gin. Everything being thus prepared,
the three men sat round the table, John Crumb looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair
again and again before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ventured to occupy it. <div class="bookquote">``If you'll sit
yourself down, I'll give you a bit of something to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby
at last. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank at once into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair. Ruby cut up the fowl
standing, and dispensed the other good things, not even placing a
chair for herself at the table,--and apparently not expected to do
so, for no one invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Is it to be spirits or ale, Mr. Crumb?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) said, when the other two men had helped themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned
round and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) a look of love that might have softened the heart
of an Amazon; but instead of speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tumbler, and
bobbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head at the beer jug. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) filled it to the brim,
frothing it in the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved to have it frothed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
raised it to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth slowly, and poured the liquor in as though to
a vat. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) filled it again. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would
be as kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) knew how,--short of love.

<p/>There was a good deal of eating done, for more ham came in, and
another mountain of cabbage; but very little or nothing was said.
John Crumb ate whatever was given to him (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) of the fowl, sedulously
picking the bones, and almost swallowing them; and then finished
the second dish of ham, and after that the second instalment of
cabbage. He (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) did not ask for more beer, but took it as often as
Ruby replenished his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) glass. When the eating was done, Ruby retired
into the back kitchen, and there regaled herself with some bone or
merry-thought of the fowl, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had with prudence reserved,
sharing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) spoils however with the other maiden. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did
standing, and then went to work, cleaning the dishes. The men lit
their pipes and smoked in silence, while Ruby went through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
domestic duties. So matters went on for half an hour; during which
Ruby escaped by the back door, went round into the house, got into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own room, and formed the grand resolution of going to bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
began her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) operations in fear and trembling, not being sure but that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) grandfather would bring the man up-stairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) thought
of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) stayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) hand, and looked to the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) knew well
that there was no bolt there. It would be terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) to be
invaded by John Crumb after his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) fifth or sixth glass of beer. And,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) declared to herself, that should he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) come he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would be sure to
bring Joe Mixet with him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) mind for him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>). So she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) paused and
listened.

<p/>When they had smoked for some half hour the old man called for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
granddaughter, but called of course in vain. <div class="bookquote">``Where the mischief is
the jade gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, slowly making his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way into the back kitchen.
The maid as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) master moving, escaped into the
yard and made no response, while the old man stood bawling at the
back door. <div class="bookquote">``The devil's in them. They're off some gates,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said
aloud. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll make the place hot for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) goes on this way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned to the two young men. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s playing off her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) games
somwheres,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Take a glass of sperrits and water, Mr. Crumb,
and I'll see after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll just take a drop of y'ell,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John Crumb, apparently quite
unmoved by the absence of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sweetheart.

<p/>It was sad work for the old man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went down the yard and into the
garden, hobbling among the cabbages, not daring to call very loud, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not wish to have it supposed that the girl was lost; but still
anxious, and sore at heart as to the ingratitude shown to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
not bound to give the girl a home at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own child.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had offered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) #500! <div class="bookquote">``Domm her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said aloud as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
way back to the house. After much search and considerable loss of
time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned to the kitchen in which the two men were sitting,
leading Ruby in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was not smart in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) apparel, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had half undressed herself, and been then compelled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
grandfather to make herself fit to appear in public. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had
acknowledged to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had better go down and tell John
Crumb the truth. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was still determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) would never be
John Crumb's wife. <div class="bookquote">``You can answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) as well as I, grandfather,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had said. Then the farmer had cuffed her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>), and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
was an idiot. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if it comes to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid
of John Crumb, nor yet of nobody else. Only I didn't think you'd go
to strike me, grandfather.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll knock the life out of thee, if thou
goest on this gate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) had said. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had consented to come down,
and they entered the room together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're a disturbing you a`most too late, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mixet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Mixet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't that at all, Mr. Mixet. If grandfather chooses to have
a few friends, I ain't nothing against it. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'d have a few
friends a deal oftener than he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) do. I likes nothing better than to do
for 'em;--only when I've done for 'em and they're smoking their pipes
and that like, I don't see why I ain't to leave 'em to 'emselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we've come here on a hauspicious occasion, Miss Ruby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know nothing about auspicious, Mr. Mixet. If you and Mr.
Crumb've come out to Sheep's Acre farm for a bit of supper--''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which we ain't,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John Crumb very loudly;--<div class="bookquote">``nor yet for
beer;--not by no means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've come for the smiles of beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Mixet/Mixet/Joe</b></font>)</div>said Joe Mixet.

<p/>Ruby chucked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mixet, if you'll be so good as to stow
that! There ain't no beauty here as I knows of, and if there was it
isn't nothing to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except in the way of friendship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Mixet/Mixet/Joe</b></font>)</div>said Mixet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just as sick of all this as a man can be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Ruggles,
who was sitting low in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) back bent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) head
forward. <div class="bookquote">``I won't put up with it no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who wants you to put up with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby. <div class="bookquote">``Who wants 'em to come
here with their trash? Who brought 'em to-night? I don't know what
business Mr. Mixet has interfering along o' me. I never interfere
along o' him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John Crumb, have you anything to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the old man.

<p/>Then John Crumb slowly arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) chair, and stood up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) full
height. <div class="bookquote">``I hove,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>), swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) head to one side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) was still standing bolt upright with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) hands
down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) side. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) glass which
was half full of beer, and strengthened himself as far as that would
strengthen him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>). Having done this he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) slowly deposited the pipe which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) still held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) right hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now speak your mind, like a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Mixet/Mixet/Joe</b></font>)</div>said Mixet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I intends it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) still stood dumb, looking down upon
old Ruggles, who from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) crouched position was looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>).
Ruby was standing with both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) hands upon the table and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) eyes
intent upon the wall over the fire-place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've asked Miss Ruby to be your wife a dozen times;--haven't you,
John?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested Mixet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you mean to be as good as your word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has promised to have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More nor once or twice?''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>To this proposition Crumb found it only
necessary to bob his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You're ready,--and willing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I om.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're wishing to have the banns said without any more delay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't no delay `bout me;--never was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything is ready in your own house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will expect Miss Ruby to come to the scratch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sholl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's about it, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Mixet/Mixet/Joe</b></font>)</div>said Joe Mixet, turning to the
grandfather. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think there was ever anything much more
straightforward than that. You know, I know, Miss Ruby knows all
about John Crumb. John Crumb didn't come to Bungay yesterday,--nor
yet the day before. There's been a talk of five hundred pounds, Mr.
Ruggles.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ruggles</b></font>)</div>Mr. Ruggles made a slight gesture of assent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Five hundred pounds is very comfortable; and added to what John has

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nohow's,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>said the lover, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) head and still standing

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>);--it isn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) ways, and them as knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)'ll never say it of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I has,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) hand a little above his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) stomach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And feelings as a man. It's true love as has brought John Crumb to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I has to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>repeated John Crumb, <div class="bookquote">``and I means it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't say to-morrow, Mr. Crumb, nor yet the day after to-morrow,

refrain from tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young women is allowed to change their minds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brute!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed old Ruggles. <div class="bookquote">``Pig! Jade! I'll tell`ee what, John.

But, oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has a mind to put me so abouts, that I'll have to go

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dash it, Miss Ruby, you ain't a going to serve a young man that

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll jist keep yourself to yourself, I'll be obliged to you,

have been different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark at that now,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) friend almost with
indignation.

<p/>Mr. Mixet, who was fully aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) rare eloquence and of the
absolute necessity there had been for its exercise if any arrangement
were to be made at all, could not trust himself to words after this.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) hat and walked out through the back kitchen into the
yard declaring that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) friend would find him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) there, round by the
pig-stye wall, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) was ready to return to Bungay. As soon as
Mixet was gone John looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) sweetheart out of the corners of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) eyes and made a slow motion towards her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) right
hand as a feeler. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>)'s aff now, Ruby,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'd better be aff after him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the cruel girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when'll I come back again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never. It ain't no use. What's the good of more words, Mr. Crumb?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) shall have the best bed in my house if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'ll come for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't go up to any room here, you jade you.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said this got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair as though to fly at her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stick but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was stopped by John Crumb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't hit the girl, no gate, Mr. Ruggles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Domm her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), John; she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) breaks my heart.''

<div class="bookquote">``Ain't it more nor a man ought to have to bear;--ain't it, Mr.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the ways on 'em, Mr. Ruggles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ways on 'em! A whipping at the cart-tail ought to be the ways on

 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div><p/>Then John Crumb turned red all over, through the flour, and sparks of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm told there's been the squoire's cousin aboot,--him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) as they call

off through the back kitchen after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV.

<p/>RUBY RUGGLES OBEYS HER GRANDFATHER.


<p/>The next day there was great surprise at Sheep's Acre farm, which
communicated itself to the towns of Bungay and Beccles, and even
affected the ordinary quiet life of Carbury Manor. Ruby Ruggles had
gone away, and at about twelve o'clock in the day the old farmer
became aware of the fact. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had started early, at about seven in
the morning; but Ruggles himself had been out long before that, and
had not condescended to ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) returned to the house
for his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) breakfast. There had been a bad scene up in the bedroom
overnight, after John Crumb had left the farm. The old man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
anger had tried to expel the girl; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had hung on to the
bed-post and would not go; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been frightened, when the maid
came up crying and screaming murder. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be out o' this to-morrow
as sure as my name's Dannel Ruggles,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer panting for
breath. But for the gin which he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had taken he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would hardly have
struck her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>);--but he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) by the hair, and
knocked her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) about;--and in the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) word and
was away. About twelve he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) heard from the servant girl that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had packed a box and had started up the road carrying the
box herself. <div class="bookquote">``Grandfather says I'm to go, and I'm gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had said
to the girl. At the first cottage she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had got a boy to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
box into Beccles, and to Beccles she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had walked. For an hour or two
Ruggles sat, quiet, within the house, telling himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) might
do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) pleased with herself,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was well rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>), and
that from henceforth he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would trouble himself no more about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>). But
by degrees there came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a feeling half of compassion and half
of fear, with perhaps some mixture of love, instigating him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to make
search for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had been the same to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as a child, and what
would people say of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) to depart from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) after
this fashion? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) violence the night before, and
the fact that the servant girl had heard if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not seen it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not drop his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) responsibility in regard to Ruby, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
would. So, as a first step, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sent in a message to John Crumb, at
Bungay, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that Ruby Ruggles had gone off with a box to
Beccles. John Crumb went open-mouthed with the news to Joe Mixet, and
all Bungay soon knew that Ruby Ruggles had run away.

<p/>After sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) message to Crumb the old man still sat thinking,
and at last made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) would go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) landlord. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>)
held a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) farm under Roger Carbury, and Roger Carbury would
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ought to do. A great trouble had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
would fain have been quiet, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) conscience and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heart and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
terrors all were at work together,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not
eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) dinner. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had out his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cart and horse and drove himself
off to Carbury Hall.

<p/>It was past four when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) started, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) found the squire seated on
the terrace after an early dinner, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) was Father Barham,
the priest. The old man was shown at once round into the garden, and
was not long in telling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story. There had been words between him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) granddaughter about her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) lover. Her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) lover had been accepted
and had come to the farm to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) bride. Ruby had behaved very
badly. The old man made the most of Ruby's bad behaviour, and of
course as little as possible of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own violence. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did explain
that there had been threats used when Ruby refused to take the man,
and that Ruby had, this day, taken herself off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always thought it was settled they were to be man and wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said
Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was settled, squoire;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) war to have five hun`erd pound
down;--money as I'd saved myself. Drat the jade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Daniel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) well enough till she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d seed somebody else.''  (<font color='red'><b>Daniel Ruggles/Daniel</b></font>)</div>Then old
Daniel paused, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) head, and was evidently the owner of a
secret. The squire got up and walked round the garden with him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>),--and
then the secret was told. The farmer was of opinion that there was
something between the girl and Sir Felix. Sir Felix some weeks since
had been seen near the farm and on the same occasion Ruby had been
observed at some little distance from the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) best clothes
on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>)'s been so little here, Daniel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>said the squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It goes as tinder and a spark o' fire, that does,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer.
<div class="bookquote">``Girls like Ruby don't want no time to be wooed by one such as that,
though they'll fall-lall with a man like John Crumb for years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)'s gone to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know nothing of where she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)'s gone, squoire;--only she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) have
gone some'eres. May be it's Lowestoffe. There's lots of quality at
Lowestoffe a' washing theyselves in the sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they returned to the priest, who might be supposed to be
cognisant of the guiles of the world and competent to give advice on
such an occasion as this. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was one of our people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Barham</b></font>)</div>said Father
Barham, <div class="bookquote">``we should have her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) back quick enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father Barham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would ye now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruggles, wishing at the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) and all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) family had been brought up as Roman Catholics.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how you would have more chance of catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) than we
have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)'d catch herself. Wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) might be she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)'d go to the priest,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) wouldn't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)'d seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) put on the way back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With a flea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) lug,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>suggested the farmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your people never go to a clergyman in their distress. It's the last
thing they'd think of. Any one might more probably be regarded as a
friend than the parson. But with us the poor know where to look for
sympathy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) ain't that poor, neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>the grandfather</b></font>)</div>said the grandfather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had money with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) ain't been brought up poor.
And I don't think as our Ruby'd go of herself to any clergyman. It
never was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It never is the way with a Protestant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>said the priest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll say no more about that for the present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, who was
waxing wroth with the priest. That a man should be fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
religion is right; but Roger Carbury was beginning to think that
Father Barham was too fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) religion. <div class="bookquote">``What had we better do?
I suppose we shall hear something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) at the railway. There are
not so many people leaving Beccles but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) may be remembered.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So the waggonette was ordered, and they all prepared to go off to the
station together.

<p/>But before they started John Crumb rode up to the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had gone
at once to the farm on hearing of Ruby's departure, and had followed
the farmer from thence to Carbury. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) found the squire and the
priest and the old man standing around as the horses were being put
to the carriage. <div class="bookquote">``Ye ain't a' found her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>), Mr. Ruggles, ha' ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
asked as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wiped the sweat from his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) brow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Noa;--we ain't a' found no one yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it was as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was to come to harm, Mr. Carbury, I'd never forgive
myself,--never,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said Crumb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as I can understand it is no doing of yours, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div>said
the squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In one way, it ain't; and in one way it is. I was over there last
night a bothering of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'d a' come round may be, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'d a'
been left alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) wouldn't a' been off now, only for our going
over to Sheep's Acre. But,--oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Mr. Crumb?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)'s a coosin o' yours, squoire; and long as I've known Suffolk,
I've never known nothing but good o' you and yourn. But if your
baronite has been and done this! Oh, Mr. Carbury! If I was to wring
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) neck round, you wouldn't say as how I was wrong; would ye, now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger could hardly answer the question. On general grounds the
wringing of Sir Felix's neck, let the immediate cause for such a
performance have been what it might, would have seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to be
a good deed. The world would be better, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thinking,
with Sir Felix out of it than in it. But still the young man was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cousin and a Carbury, and to such a one as John Crumb he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bound
to defend any member of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be defensible.
<div class="bookquote">``They says as how he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was groping about Sheep's Acre when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was last
here, a hiding himself and skulking behind hedges. Drat 'em all.
They've gals enough of their own,--them fellows. Why can't they let a
fellow alone? I'll do him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a mischief, Master Roger; I wull;--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'s
had a hand in this.''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>Poor John Crumb! When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress to
win he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could find no words for himself; but was obliged to take an
eloquent baker with him (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) to talk for him (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>). Now in his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) anger he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) could
talk freely enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must first learn that Sir Felix has had anything to do with
this, Mr. Crumb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In coorse; in coorse. That's right. That's right. Must l'arn as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
did it, afore I does it. But when I have l'arned!'' (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>-- And John Crumb
clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) fist as though a very short lesson would suffice for him (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>)
upon this occasion.

<p/>They all went to the Beccles Station, and from thence to the Beccles
post office,--so that Beccles soon knew as much about it as Bungay.
At the railway station Ruby was distinctly remembered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had taken
a second-class ticket by the morning train for London, and had gone
off without any appearance of secrecy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had been decently dressed,
with a hat and cloak, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) luggage had been such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) might have
been expected to carry, had all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) friends known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was going.
So much was made clear at the railway station, but nothing more could
be learned there. Then a message was sent by telegraph to the station
in London, and they all waited, loitering about the post office, for
a reply. One of the porters in London remembered seeing such a girl
as was described, but the man who was supposed to have carried her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
box for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to a cab had gone away for the day. It was believed that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left the station in a four-wheel cab. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be arter her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).
I'll be arter her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John Crumb. But there was no train
till night, and Roger Carbury was doubtful whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) going would do
any good. It was evidently fixed on Crumb's mind that the first step
towards finding Ruby would be the breaking of every bone in the body
of Sir Felix Carbury. Now it was not at all apparent to the squire
that his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) cousin had had anything to do with this affair. It had been
made quite clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) that the old man had quarrelled with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
granddaughter and had threatened to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, not
because she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) had misbehaved with Sir Felix, but on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
refusing to marry John Crumb. John Crumb had gone over to the farm
expecting to arrange it all, and up to that time there had been no
fear about Felix Carbury. Nor was it possible that there should have
been communication between Ruby and Felix since the quarrel at the
farm. Even if the old man were right in supposing that Ruby and the
baronet had been acquainted,--and such acquaintance could not but be
prejudicial to the girl,--not on that account would the baronet be
responsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) abduction. John Crumb was thirsting for blood and
was not very capable in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) present mood of arguing the matter out
coolly, and Roger, little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin, was not desirous
that all Suffolk should know that Sir Felix Carbury had been thrashed
within an inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) life by John Crumb of Bungay. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you
what I'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hand kindly on the old man's
shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go up myself by the first train to-morrow. I can
trace her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) better than Mr. Crumb can do, and you will both trust me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not one in the two counties I'd trust so soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old
man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll let us know the very truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John Crumb. Roger
Carbury made him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) an indiscreet promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) know
the truth. So the matter was settled, and the grandfather and lover
returned together to Bungay.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXV.

<p/>MELMOTTE``S GLORY.


<p/>Augustus Melmotte was becoming greater and greater in every
direction,--mightier and mightier every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was learning to
despise mere lords, and to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might almost domineer over
a duke. In truth he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did recognise it as a fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must either
domineer over dukes, or else go to the wall. It can hardly be said of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had intended to play so high a game, but the game that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had intended to play had become thus high of its own accord. A man
cannot always restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own doings and keep them within the limits
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had himself planned for them. They will very often fall
short of the magnitude to which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ambition has aspired. They will
sometimes soar higher than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own imagination. So it had now been
with Mr. Melmotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had contemplated great things; but the things
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was achieving were beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) contemplation.

<p/>The reader will not have thought much of Fisker on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) arrival in
England. Fisker was, perhaps, not a man worthy of much thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had never read a book. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never written a line worth reading.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never said a prayer. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cared nothing for humanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
sprung out of some Californian gully, was perhaps ignorant of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
father and mother, and had tumbled up in the world on the strength
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own audacity. But, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sufficed to give
the necessary impetus for rolling Augustus Melmotte onwards into
almost unprecedented commercial greatness. When Mr. Melmotte took his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
offices in Abchurch Lane, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was undoubtedly a great man, but nothing
so great as when the South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway had
become not only an established fact, but a fact established in
Abchurch Lane. The great company indeed had an office of its own,
where the Board was held; but everything was really managed in
Mr. Melmotte's own commercial sanctum. Obeying, no doubt, some
inscrutable law of commerce, the grand enterprise,--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps the
grandest when you consider the amount of territory manipulated, which
has ever opened itself before the eyes of a great commercial people,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fisker/MR. FISKER</b></font>)</div>as Mr. Fisker with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) peculiar eloquence observed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) nose,
about this time to a meeting of shareholders at San Francisco,--had
swung itself across from California to London, turning itself to the
centre of the commercial world as the needle turns to the pole, till
Mr. Fisker almost regretted the deed which himself had done. And
Melmotte was not only the head, but the body also, and the feet of
it all. The shares seemed to be all in Melmotte's pocket, so that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could distribute them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would; and it seemed also that when
distributed and sold, and when bought again and sold again, they came
back to Melmotte's pocket. Men were contented to buy their shares and
to pay their money, simply on Melmotte's word. Sir Felix had realised
a large portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) winnings at cards,--with commendable prudence
for one so young and extravagant,--and had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) savings to the
great man. The great man had swept the earnings of the Beargarden
into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) till, and had told Sir Felix that the shares were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Sir
Felix had been not only contented, but supremely happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could now
do as Paul Montague was doing,--and Lord Alfred Grendall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) could
realize a perennial income, buying and selling. It was only after
the reflection of a day or two that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had as yet got
nothing to sell. It was not only Sir Felix that was admitted into
these good things after this fashion. Sir Felix was but one among
hundreds. In the meantime the bills in Grosvenor Square were no doubt
paid with punctuality,--and these bills must have been stupendous.
The very servants were as tall, as gorgeous, almost as numerous, as
the servants of royalty,--and remunerated by much higher wages. There
were four coachmen with egregious wigs, and eight footmen, not one
with a circumference of calf less than eighteen inches.

<p/>And now there appeared a paragraph in the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>and another appeared in the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>telling the world
that Mr. Melmotte had bought Pickering Park, the magnificent Sussex
property of Adolphus Longestaffe, Esq., of Caversham. And it was so.
The father and son who never had agreed before, and who now had come
to no agreement in the presence of each other, had each considered
that their affairs would be safe in the hands of so great a man as
Mr. Melmotte, and had been brought to terms. The purchase-money,
which was large, was to be divided between them. The thing was done
with the greatest ease,--there being no longer any delay as is the
case when small people are at work. The magnificence of Mr. Melmotte
affected even the Longestaffe lawyers. Were I to buy a little
property, some humble cottage with a garden,--or you, O reader,
unless you be magnificent,--the money to the last farthing would be
wanted, or security for the money more than sufficient, before we
should be able to enter in upon our new home. But money was the very
breath of Melmotte's nostrils, and therefore his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) breath was taken for
money. Pickering was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>), and before a week was over a London builder
had collected masons and carpenters by the dozen down at Chichester,
and was at work upon the house to make it fit to be a residence for
Madame Melmotte. There were rumours that it was to be made ready for
the Goodwood week, and that the Melmotte entertainment during that
festival would rival the duke's.

<p/>But there was still much to be done in London before the Goodwood
week should come round in all of which Mr. Melmotte was concerned,
and of much of which Mr. Melmotte was the very centre. A member for
Westminster had succeeded to a peerage, and thus a seat was vacated.
It was considered to be indispensable to the country that Mr.
Melmotte should go into Parliament, and what constituency could such
a man as Melmotte so fitly represent as one combining as Westminster
does all the essences of the metropolis? There was the popular
element, the fashionable element, the legislative element, the legal
element, and the commercial element. Melmotte undoubtedly was the man
for Westminster. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thorough popularity was evinced by testimony
which perhaps was never before given in favour of any candidate for
any county or borough. In Westminster there must of course be a
contest. A seat for Westminster is a thing not to be abandoned by
either political party without a struggle. But, at the beginning of
the affair, when each party had to seek the most suitable candidate
which the country could supply, each party put its hand upon
Melmotte. And when the seat, and the battle for the seat, were
suggested to Melmotte, then for the first time was that great man
forced to descend from the altitudes on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind generally
dwelt, and to decide whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would enter Parliament as a
Conservative or a Liberal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not long in convincing himself that
the Conservative element in British Society stood the most in need
of that fiscal assistance which it would be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) province to give;
and on the next day every hoarding in London declared to the world
that Melmotte was the Conservative candidate for Westminster. It is
needless to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) committee was made up of peers, bankers, and
publicans, with all that absence of class prejudice for which the
party has become famous since the ballot was introduced among us.
Some unfortunate Liberal was to be made to run against him (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>), for the
sake of the party; but the odds were ten to one on Melmotte.

<p/>This no doubt was a great matter,--this affair of the seat; but the
dinner to be given to the Emperor of China was much greater. It was
the middle of June, and the dinner was to be given on Monday, 8th
July, now three weeks hence;--but all London was already talking of
it. The great purport proposed was to show to the Emperor by this
banquet what an English merchant-citizen of London could do. Of
course there was a great amount of scolding and a loud clamour on the
occasion. Some men said that Melmotte was not a citizen of London,
others that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not a merchant, others again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not an
Englishman. But no man could deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was both able and willing
to spend the necessary money; and as this combination of ability and
will was the chief thing necessary, they who opposed the arrangement
could only storm and scold. On the 20th of June the tradesmen were
at work, throwing up a building behind, knocking down walls, and
generally transmuting the house in Grosvenor Square in such a fashion
that two hundred guests might be able to sit down to dinner in the
dining-room of a British merchant.

<p/>But who were to be the two hundred? It used to be the case that when
a gentleman gave a dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own guests;--but when affairs
become great, society can hardly be carried on after that simple
fashion. The Emperor of China could not be made to sit at table
without English royalty, and English royalty must know whom it has to
meet,--must select at any rate some of its comrades. The minister of
the day also had his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) candidates for the dinner,--in which arrangement
there was however no private patronage, as the list was confined to
the cabinet and their wives. The Prime Minister took some credit to
himself in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) would not ask for a single ticket for a private
friend. But the Opposition as a body desired their share of seats.
Melmotte had elected to stand for Westminster on the Conservative
interest, and was advised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must insist on having as it were
a Conservative cabinet present, with its Conservative wives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) owed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) party, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) party exacted payment
of the debt. But the great difficulty lay with the city merchants.
This was to be a city merchant's private feast, and it was essential
that the Emperor should meet this great merchant's brother merchants
at the merchant's board. No doubt the Emperor would see all the
merchants at the Guildhall; but that would be a semi-public affair,
paid for out of the funds of a corporation. This was to be a private
dinner. Now the Lord Mayor had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) face against it, and what was
to be done? Meetings were held; a committee was appointed; merchant
guests were selected, to the number of fifteen with their fifteen
wives;--and subsequently the Lord Mayor was made a baronet on the
occasion of receiving the Emperor in the city. The Emperor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)
suite was twenty. Royalty had twenty tickets, each ticket for guest
and wife. The existing Cabinet was fourteen; but the coming was
numbered at about eleven only;--each one for self and wife. Five
ambassadors and five ambassadresses were to be asked. There were to
be fifteen real merchants out of the city. Ten great peers,--with
their peeresses,--were selected by the general committee of
management. There were to be three wise men, two poets, three
independent members of the House of Commons, two Royal Academicians,
three editors of papers, an African traveller who had just come home,
and a novelist;--but all these latter gentlemen were expected to come
as bachelors. Three tickets were to be kept over for presentation
to bores endowed with a power of making themselves absolutely
unendurable if not admitted at the last moment,--and ten were left
for the giver of the feast and his (<font color='blue'><b>giver</b></font>) own family and friends. It is
often difficult to make things go smooth,--but almost all roughnesses
may be smoothed at last with patience and care, and money and
patronage.

<p/>But the dinner was not to be all. Eight hundred additional tickets
were to be issued for Madame Melmotte's evening entertainment, and
the fight for these was more internecine than for seats at the
dinner. The dinner-seats, indeed, were handled in so statesmanlike a
fashion that there was not much visible fighting about them. Royalty
manages its affairs quietly. The existing Cabinet was existing, and
though there were two or three members of it who could not have got
themselves elected at a single unpolitical club in London, they had a
right to their seats at Melmotte's table. What disappointed ambition
there might be among Conservative candidates was never known to the
public. Those gentlemen do not wash their dirty linen in public.
The ambassadors of course were quiet, but we may be sure that the
Minister from the United States was among the favoured five. The
city bankers and bigwigs, as has been already said, were at first
unwilling to be present, and therefore they who were not chosen could
not afterwards express their displeasure. No grumbling was heard
among the peers, and that which came from the peeresses floated down
into the current of the great fight about the evening entertainment.
The poet laureate was of course asked, and the second poet was as
much a matter of course. Only two Academicians had in this year
painted royalty, so that there was no ground for jealousy there.
There were three, and only three, specially insolent and specially
disagreeable independent members of Parliament at that time in the
House, and there was no difficulty in selecting them. The wise men
were chosen by their age. Among editors of newspapers there was some
ill-blood. That Mr. Alf and Mr. Broune should be selected was almost
a matter of course. They were hated accordingly, but still this was
expected. But why was Mr. Booker there? Was it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Booker</b></font>) had praised
the Prime Minister's translation of Catullus? The African traveller
chose himself by living through all his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) perils and coming home. A
novelist was selected; but as royalty wanted another ticket at the
last moment, the gentleman was only asked to come in after dinner.
His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) proud heart, however, resented the treatment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) joined
amicably with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) literary brethren in decrying the festival
altogether.

<p/>We should be advancing too rapidly into this portion of our story
were we to concern ourselves deeply at the present moment with the
feud as it raged before the evening came round, but it may be right
to indicate that the desire for tickets at last became a burning
passion, and a passion which in the great majority of cases could
not be indulged. The value of the privilege was so great that Madame
Melmotte thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was doing almost more than friendship
called for when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) informed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) guest, Miss Longestaffe, that
unfortunately there would be no seat for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) at the dinner-table;
but that, as payment for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) loss, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should receive an evening
ticket for herself and a joint ticket for a gentleman and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife.
Georgiana was at first indignant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) accepted the compromise.
What she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) did with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) tickets shall be hereafter told.

<p/>From all this I trust it will be understood that the Mr. Melmotte of
the present hour was a very different man from that Mr. Melmotte who
was introduced to the reader in the early chapters of this chronicle.
Royalty was not to be smuggled in and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) house now without
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) being allowed to see it. No manoeuvres now were necessary to
catch a simple duchess. Duchesses were willing enough to come. Lord
Alfred when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was called by his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) Christian name felt no aristocratic
twinges. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was only too anxious to make himself more and more
necessary to the great man. It is true that all this came as it were
by jumps, so that very often a part of the world did not know on what
ledge in the world the great man was perched at that moment. Miss
Longestaffe who was staying in the house did not at all know how
great a man her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) host was. Lady Monogram when she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) refused to go to
Grosvenor Square, or even to allow any one to come out of the house
in Grosvenor Square to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) parties, was groping in outer darkness.
Madame Melmotte did not know. Marie Melmotte did not know. The
great man did not quite know himself where, from time to time, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was standing. But the world at large knew. The world knew that Mr.
Melmotte was to be Member for Westminster, that Mr. Melmotte was to
entertain the Emperor of China, that Mr. Melmotte carried the South
Central Pacific and Mexican Railway in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pocket;--and the world
worshipped Mr. Melmotte.

<p/>In the meantime Mr. Melmotte was much troubled about his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) private
affairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had promised his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) daughter to Lord Nidderdale, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
rose in the world had lowered the price which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) offered for this
marriage,--not so much in the absolute amount of fortune to be
ultimately given, as in the manner of giving it. Fifteen thousand a
year was to be settled on Marie and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) eldest son, and twenty
thousand pounds were to be paid into Nidderdale's hands six months
after the marriage. Melmotte gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) reasons for not paying this sum
at once. Nidderdale would be more likely to be quiet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were kept
waiting for that short time. Melmotte was to purchase and furnish for
them a house in town. It was, too, almost understood that the young
people were to have Pickering Park for themselves, except for a week
or so at the end of July. It was absolutely given out in the papers
that Pickering was to be theirs. It was said on all sides that
Nidderdale was doing very well for himself. The absolute money
was not perhaps so great as had been at first asked; but then,
at that time, Melmotte was not the strong rock, the impregnable
tower of commerce, the very navel of the commercial enterprise of
the world,--as all men now regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Nidderdale's father, and
Nidderdale himself, were, in the present condition of things, content
with a very much less stringent bargain than that which they had
endeavoured at first to exact.

<p/>But, in the midst of all this, Marie, who had at one time consented
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father's instance to accept the young lord, and who in some
speechless fashion had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), told both the young lord and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father, very roundly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mind. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father
scowled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mind in the matter was of no
concern. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) intended that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) should marry Lord Nidderdale, and
himself fixed some day in August for the wedding. <div class="bookquote">``It is no use,
father, for I will never have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it about that other scamp?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) asked angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean Sir Felix Carbury, it is about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been to you
and told you, and therefore I don't know why I need hold my tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll both starve, my lady; that's all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie however was not so
wedded to the grandeur which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) encountered in Grosvenor Square as
to be afraid of the starvation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) might have to
suffer if married to Sir Felix Carbury. Melmotte had not time for any
long discussion. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``By --,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you run rusty after all I've done for you,
I'll make you suffer. You little fool; that man's a beggar. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) hasn't
the price of a petticoat or a pair of stockings. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'s looking only
for what you haven't got, and shan't have if you marry him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) wants
money, not you, you little fool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But after that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was quite settled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) purpose when Nidderdale
spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). They had been engaged and then it had been off;--and
now the young nobleman, having settled everything with the father,
expected no great difficulty in resettling everything with the girl.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not very skilful at making love,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was thoroughly
good-humoured, from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nature anxious to please, and averse to give
pain. There was hardly any injury which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not forgive, and
hardly any kindness which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not do,--so that the labour upon
himself was not too great. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``governors
are stern beings: are they not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is yours stern, my lord?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I mean is that sons and daughters have to obey them. I think
you understand what I mean. I was awfully spoony on you that time
before; I was indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it didn't hurt you much, Lord Nidderdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so like a woman; that is. You know well enough that you and I
can't marry without leave from the governors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how that may be. There was some hitch somewhere,--I
don't quite know where.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--The hitch had been with himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
demanded ready money. <div class="bookquote">``But it's all right now. The old fellows are
agreed. Can't we make a match of it, Miss Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lord Nidderdale; I don't think we can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do mean it. When that was going on before I knew nothing about it.
I have seen more of things since then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you've seen somebody you like better than me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say nothing about that, Lord Nidderdale. I don't think you ought
to blame me, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was something before, but it was you that was off first.
Wasn't it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The governors were off, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The governors have a right to be off, I suppose. But I don't think
any governor has a right to make anybody marry any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I agree with you there;--I do indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And no governor shall make me marry. I've thought a great deal about
it since that other time, and that's what I've come to determine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't know why you shouldn't--just marry me--because you--like
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only,--just because I don't. Well; I do like you, Lord Nidderdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks;--so much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like you ever so,--only marrying a person is different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something in that to be sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't mind telling you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie with an almost solemn
expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) countenance, <div class="bookquote">``because you are good-natured and
won't get me into a scrape if you can help it, that I do like
somebody else;--oh, so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I supposed that was it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a deuced pity. The governors had settled everything, and we
should have been awfully jolly. I'd have gone in for all the things
you go in for; and though your governor was screwing us up a bit,
there would have been plenty of tin to go on with. You couldn't think
of it again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you, my lord, I'm--in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ah;--yes. So you were saying. It's an awful bore. That's all. I
shall come to the party all the same if you send me a ticket.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>And so
Nidderdale took his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) dismissal, and went away,--not however without an
idea that the marriage would still come off. There was always,--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
thought,--such a bother about things before they would get themselves
fixed. This happened some days after Mr. Broune's proposal to Lady
Carbury, more than a week since Marie had seen Sir Felix. As soon as
Lord Nidderdale was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) wrote again to Sir Felix begging that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) might hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>),--and entrusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) letter to Didon.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI.

<p/>MR. BROUNE``S PERILS.


<p/>Lady Carbury had allowed herself two days for answering Mr. Broune's
proposition. It was made on Tuesday night and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was bound by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
promise to send a reply some time on Thursday. But early on the
Wednesday morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind; and at noon on that day
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) letter was written. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had spoken to Hetta about the man, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had seen that Hetta had disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was not disposed to
be much guided by Hetta's opinion. In regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was always influenced by a vague idea that Hetta was an unnecessary
trouble. There was an excellent match ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would
only accept it. There was no reason why Hetta should continue
to add herself to the family burden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) never said this even
to herself,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) felt it, and was not therefore inclined to
consult Hetta's comfort on this occasion. But nevertheless, what her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
daughter said had its effect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had encountered the troubles of
one marriage, and they had been very bad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not look upon that
marriage as a mistake,--having even up to this day a consciousness
that it had been the business of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life, as a portionless girl,
to obtain maintenance and position at the expense of suffering and
servility. But that had been done. The maintenance was, indeed, again
doubtful, because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son's vices; but it might so probably be
again secured,--by means of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son's beauty! Hetta had said that
Mr. Broune liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) own way. Had not she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) herself found that all men
liked their own way? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) liked the comfort
of a home to herself. Personally she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not want the companionship
of a husband. And what scenes would there be between Felix and the
man! And added to all this there was something within her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), almost
amounting to conscience, which told her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) that it was not right that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) should burden any one with the responsibility and inevitable
troubles of such a son as her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) son Felix. What would she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) do were her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
husband to command her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to separate herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) son? In such
circumstances she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would certainly separate herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) husband.
Having considered these things deeply, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) wrote as follows to Mr.
Broune:--


<p/>DEAREST FRIEND,

<p/>I need not tell you that I have thought much of your
generous and affectionate offer. How could I refuse such
a prospect as you offer me without much thought? I regard
your career as the most noble which a man's ambition can
achieve. And in that career no one is your superior. I
cannot but be proud that such a one as you should have
asked me to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. But, my friend, life is subject
to wounds which are incurable, and my life has been so
wounded. I have not strength left me to make my heart
whole enough to be worthy of your acceptance. I have been
so cut and scotched and lopped by the sufferings which
I have endured that I am best alone. It cannot all be
described;--and yet with you I would have no reticence.
I would put the whole history before you to read, with all
my troubles past and still present, all my hopes, and all
my fears,--with every circumstance as it has passed by and
every expectation that remains, were it not that the poor
tale would be too long for your patience. The result of it
would be to make you feel that I am no longer fit to enter
in upon a new home. I should bring showers instead of
sunshine, melancholy in lieu of mirth.

<p/>I will, however, be bold enough to assure you that could
I bring myself to be the wife of any man I would now
become your wife. But I shall never marry again.

<p/>Nevertheless, I am your most affectionate friend,

<p/>MATILDA CARBURY.


<p/>About six o'clock in the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sent this letter to
Mr. Broune's rooms in Pall Mall East, and then sat for awhile
alone,--full of regrets. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had thrown away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a firm footing
which would certainly have served her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whole life. Even at
this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was in debt,--and did not know how to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) debts
without mortgaging her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life income. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) longed for some staff on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could lean. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was afraid of the future. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would
sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) paper before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), preparing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) future work for the
press, copying a bit here and a bit there, inventing historical
details, dovetailing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chronicle, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head would sometimes seem
to be going round as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remembered the unpaid baker, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) son's
horses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) unmeaning dissipation, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doubts about
the marriage. As regarded herself, Mr. Broune would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
secure,--but that now was all over. Poor woman! This at any rate may
be said for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),--that had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) accepted the man her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) regrets would
have been as deep.

<p/>Mr. Broune's feelings were more decided in their tone than those of
the lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had not made his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) offer without consideration, and yet
from the very moment in which it had been made he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) repented it. That
gently sarcastic appellation by which Lady Carbury had described
him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) to herself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) best explained that side of
Mr. Broune's character which showed itself in this matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was
a susceptible old goose. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) without
objection, the kissing might probably have gone on; and, whatever
might have come of it, there would have been no offer of marriage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) little manoeuvres had indicated love on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
part, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had felt himself constrained to reciprocate the passion.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was beautiful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was bright. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) clothes
like a lady; and,--if it was written in the Book of the Fates that
some lady was to sit at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) table,--Lady Carbury would
look as well there as any other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had repudiated the kiss, and
therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had felt himself bound to obtain for himself the right
to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).

<p/>The offer had no sooner been made than he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son reeling in,
drunk, at the front door. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) escape the lad had insulted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). This, perhaps, helped to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) eyes. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) woke the next
morning, or rather late in the next day, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) night's work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
was no longer able to tell himself that the world was all right with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). Who does not know that sudden thoughtfulness at waking, that
first matutinal retrospection, and pro-spection, into things as they
have been and are to be; and the lowness of heart, the blankness of
hope which follows the first remembrance of some folly lately done,
some word ill-spoken, some money misspent,--or perhaps a cigar too
much, or a glass of brandy and soda-water which he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) should have left
untasted? And when things have gone well, how the waker comforts
himself among the bedclothes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) claims for himself to be whole all
over, teres atque rotundus,--so to have managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) little affairs
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) has to fear no harm, and to blush inwardly at no error! Mr.
Broune, the way of whose life took him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) among many perils, who in the
course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) work had to steer his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) bark among many rocks, was in the
habit of thus auditing his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) daily account as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) shook off sleep about
noon,--for such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) lot, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) seldom was in bed before four
or five in the morning. On this Wednesday he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) could not
balance his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) sheet comfortably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had taken a very great step and he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had not taken it with wisdom. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) drank the cup of
tea with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) servant supplied him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was yet in bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
could not say of himself, teres atque rotundus, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was wont to do
when things were well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). Everything was to be changed. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
lit a cigarette he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) bethought himself that Lady Carbury would not like
him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) to smoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) bedroom. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) remembered other things. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
be d-- if he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) shall live in my house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) said to himself.

<p/>And there was no way out of it. It did not occur to the man that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
offer could be refused. During the whole of that day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went about
among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends in a melancholy fashion, saying little snappish
uncivil things at the club, and at last dining by himself with about
fifteen newspapers around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). After dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not speak a
word to any man, but went early to the office of the newspaper in
Trafalgar Square at which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nightly work. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was lapped
in comforts,--if the best of chairs, of sofas, of writing tables, and
of reading lamps can make a man comfortable who has to read nightly
thirty columns of a newspaper, or at any rate to make himself
responsible for their contents.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seated himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work like a man, but immediately saw Lady
Carbury's letter on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) custom when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
did not dine at home to have such documents brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
office as had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home during his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) absence;--and here was
Lady Carbury's letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) writing well, and was aware that
here was the confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fate. It had not been expected, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had given herself another day for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) answer,--but here it was,
beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. Surely this was almost unfeminine haste. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chucked
the letter, unopened, a little from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and endeavoured to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
attention on some printed slip that was ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). For some ten
minutes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes went rapidly down the lines, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mind did not follow what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was reading. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) struggled again, but
still his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts were on the letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not wish to open it,
having some vague idea that, till the letter should have been read,
there was a chance of escape. The letter would not become due to be
read till the next day. It should not have been there now to tempt
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts on this night. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do nothing while it lay
there. <div class="bookquote">``It shall be a part of the bargain that I shall never have to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened it. The second line told
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the danger was over.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had read so far he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back to the fire-place,
leaving the letter on the table. Then, after all, the woman wasn't in
love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! But that was a reading of the affair which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
hardly bring himself to look upon as correct. The woman had shown
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love by a thousand signs. There was no doubt, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
now had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) triumph. A woman always has a triumph when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rejects a
man,--and more especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does so at a certain time of life.
Would she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) publish her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) triumph? Mr. Broune would not like to have it
known about among brother editors, or by the world at large, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
had offered to marry Lady Carbury and that Lady Carbury had refused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had escaped; but the sweetness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) present safety was not
in proportion to the bitterness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) late fears.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) could not understand why Lady Carbury should have refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)! As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) reflected upon it, all memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son for the moment passed
away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). Full ten minutes had passed, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had still
stood upon the rug, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) read the entire letter. <div class="bookquote">''`Cut and
scotched and lopped!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) has been,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
had heard much of Sir Patrick, and knew well that the old general had
been no lamb. ``I shouldn't have cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), or scotched her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), or lopped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">'' When he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had read the whole letter patiently there crept upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) gradually a feeling of admiration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), greater than he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had
ever yet felt,--and, for awhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) almost thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) would
renew his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) offer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). '' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>`Showers instead of sunshine; melancholy
instead of mirth,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) repeated to himself. <div class="bookquote">``I should have done the
best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), taking the showers and the melancholy if they were
necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) work in a mixed frame of mind, but certainly without
that dragging weight which had oppressed him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) entered the
room. Gradually, through the night, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) realised the conviction that
he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had escaped, and threw from him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) altogether the idea of repeating
his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) offer. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) left he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) a line--


<p/>Be it so. It need not break our friendship.

<p/>N. B.


<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) sent by a special messenger, who returned with a note to his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>)
lodgings long before he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) was up on the following morning.


<p/>No;--no; certainly not. No word of this will ever pass my
mouth.

<p/>M. C.


<p/>Mr. Broune thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was very well out of the danger, and
resolved that Lady Carbury should never want anything that his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
friendship could do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVII.

<p/>THE BOARD-ROOM.


<p/>On Friday, the 21st June, the Board of the South Central Pacific
and Mexican Railway sat in its own room behind the Exchange, as was
the Board's custom every Friday. On this occasion all the members
were there, as it had been understood that the chairman was to make
a special statement. There was the great chairman as a matter of
course. In the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) numerous and immense concerns he (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) never
threw over the railway, or delegated to other less experienced hands
those cares which the commercial world had intrusted to his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) own. Lord
Alfred was there, with Mr. Cohenlupe, the Hebrew gentleman, and Paul
Montague, and Lord Nidderdale,--and even Sir Felix Carbury. Sir Felix
had come, being very anxious to buy and sell, and not as yet having
had an opportunity of realising his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) golden hopes, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had
actually paid a thousand pounds in hard money into Mr. Melmotte's
hands. The secretary, Mr. Miles Grendall, was also present as a
matter of course. The Board always met at three, and had generally
been dissolved at a quarter past three. Lord Alfred and Mr. Cohenlupe
sat at the chairman's right and left hand. Paul Montague generally
sat immediately below, with Miles Grendall opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>);--but on
this occasion the young lord and the young baronet took the next
places. It was a nice little family party, the great chairman with
his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) two aspiring sons-in-law, his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) two particular friends,--the social
friend, Lord Alfred, and the commercial friend Mr. Cohenlupe,--and
Miles, who was Lord Alfred's son. It would have been complete
in its friendliness, but for Paul Montague, who had lately made
himself disagreeable to Mr. Melmotte;--and most ungratefully so, for
certainly no one had been allowed so free a use of the shares as the
younger member of the house of Fisker, Montague, and Montague.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: The Board-room.-RSB-


<p/>It was understood that Mr. Melmotte was to make a statement. Lord
Nidderdale and Sir Felix had conceived that this was to be done as
it were out of the great man's own heart, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own wish, so that
something of the condition of the company might be made known to the
directors of the company. But this was not perhaps exactly the truth.
Paul Montague had insisted on giving vent to certain doubts at the
last meeting but one, and, having made himself very disagreeable
indeed, had forced this trouble on the great chairman. On the
intermediate Friday the chairman had made himself very unpleasant to
Paul, and this had seemed to be an effort on his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) part to frighten
the inimical director out of his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) opposition, so that the promise of
a statement need not be fulfilled. What nuisance can be so great to
a man busied with immense affairs, as to have to explain,--or to
attempt to explain,--small details to men incapable of understanding
them? But Montague had stood to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guns. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not intended, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said, to dispute the commercial success of the company. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt
very strongly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother directors should feel
as strongly, that it was necessary that they should know more than
they did know. Lord Alfred had declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) did not in the least
agree with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) brother director. <div class="bookquote">``If anybody don't understand, it's
his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) own fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cohenlupe. But Paul would not give way, and
it was understood that Mr. Melmotte would make a statement.

<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``Boards''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were always commenced by the reading of a certain record
of the last meeting out of a book. This was always done by Miles
Grendall; and the record was supposed to have been written by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>).
But Montague had discovered that this statement in the book was
always prepared and written by a satellite of Melmotte's from
Abchurch Lane who was never present at the meeting. The adverse
director had spoken to the secretary,--it will be remembered that
they were both members of the Beargarden,--and Miles had given a
somewhat evasive reply. <div class="bookquote">``A cussed deal of trouble and all that, you
know! He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)'s used to it, and it's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)'s meant for. I'm not going
to flurry myself about stuff of that kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Montague after this had
spoken on the subject both to Nidderdale and Felix Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
couldn't do it, if it was ever so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Nidderdale had said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
think I'd bully him (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) if I were you. He (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) gets #500 a-year, and if you
knew all he (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) owes, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) hasn't got, you wouldn't try to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>)
of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix</b></font>)</div>With Felix Carbury Montague had as little success. Sir Felix
hated the secretary, had detected him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) cheating at cards, had resolved
to expose him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>),--and had then been afraid to do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) had told Dolly
Longestaffe, and the reader will perhaps remember with what effect.
He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had not mentioned the affair again, and had gradually fallen back
into the habit of playing at the club. Loo, however, had given way to
whist, and Sir Felix had satisfied himself with the change. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) still
meditated some dreadful punishment for Miles Grendall, but, in the
meantime, felt himself unable to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) at the Board. Since the
day at which the aces had been manipulated at the club he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had not
spoken to Miles Grendall except in reference to the affairs of the
whist-table. The <div class="bookquote">``Board''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>was now commenced as usual. Miles read the
short record out of the book,--stumbling over every other word, and
going through the performance so badly that had there been anything
to understand no one could have understood it. <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Melmotte, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) usual hurried way, <div class="bookquote">``is it your pleasure that I
shall sign the record?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Paul Montague rose to say that it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
pleasure that the record should be signed. But Melmotte had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
scrawl, and was deep in conversation with Mr. Cohenlupe before Paul
could get upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) legs.

<p/>Melmotte, however, had watched the little struggle. Melmotte,
whatever might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) faults, had eyes to see and ears to hear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
perceived that Montague had made a little struggle and had been
cowed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew how hard it is for one man to persevere against
five or six, and for a young man to persevere against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elders.
Nidderdale was filliping bits of paper across the table at Carbury.
Miles Grendall was poring over the book which was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) charge.
Lord Alfred sat back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) chair, the picture of a model director,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) right hand within his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) waistcoat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) looked aristocratic,
respectable, and almost commercial. In that room he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) never by any
chance opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) mouth, except when called on to say that Mr.
Melmotte was right, and was considered by the chairman really to
earn his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) money. Melmotte for a minute or two went on conversing with
Cohenlupe, having perceived that Montague for the moment was cowed.
Then Paul put both his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands upon the table, intending to rise and
ask some perplexing question. Melmotte saw this also and was upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) legs before Montague had risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Melmotte, <div class="bookquote">``it may perhaps be as well if I take this occasion of
saying a few words to you about the affairs of the company.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Then,
instead of going on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) statement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sat down again, and began
to turn over sundry voluminous papers very slowly, whispering a word
or two every now and then to Mr. Cohenlupe. Lord Alfred never changed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) posture and never took his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) breast. Nidderdale and
Carbury filliped their paper pellets backwards and forwards. Montague
sat profoundly listening,--or ready to listen when anything should
be said. As the chairman had risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) chair to commence his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>)
statement, Paul felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) was bound to be silent. When a speaker
is in possession of the floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) is in possession even though he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) be
somewhat dilatory in looking to his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) references, and whispering to
his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) neighbour. And, when that speaker is a chairman, of course some
additional latitude must be allowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>). Montague understood this,
and sat silent. It seemed that Melmotte had much to say to Cohenlupe,
and Cohenlupe much to say to Melmotte. Since Cohenlupe had sat at the
Board he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had never before developed such powers of conversation.

<p/>Nidderdale didn't quite understand it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had been there twenty
minutes, was tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) present amusement, having been unable to
hit Carbury on the nose, and suddenly remembered that the Beargarden
would now be open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was no respecter of persons, and had got over
any little feeling of awe with which the big table and the solemnity
of the room may have first inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that's about
all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) said, looking up at Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--perhaps as your lordship is in a hurry, and as my lord here
is engaged elsewhere,'' (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>--turning round to Lord Alfred, who had not
uttered a syllable or made a sign since he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) seat,--<div class="bookquote">``we
had better adjourn this meeting for another week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot allow that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul Montague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose then we must take the sense of the Board,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chairman</b></font>)</div>said the
Chairman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been discussing certain circumstances with our friend and
Chairman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Cohenlupe, <div class="bookquote">``and I must say that it is not expedient
just at present to go into matters too freely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lords and gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``I hope that you trust me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Alfred bowed down to the table and muttered something which was
intended to convey most absolute confidence. <div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Cohenlupe. <div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale; <div class="bookquote">``go on;''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) fired
another pellet with improved success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chairman</b></font>)</div>said the Chairman, <div class="bookquote">``that my young friend, Sir Felix,
doubts neither my discretion nor my ability.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Chairman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, no;--not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, much flattered at being
addressed in this kindly tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chairman</b></font>) had come there with objects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chairman</b></font>)
own, and was quite prepared to support the Chairman on any matter
whatever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lords and Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>continued Melmotte, <div class="bookquote">``I am delighted to
receive this expression of your confidence. If I know anything in the
world I know something of commercial matters. I am able to tell you
that we are prospering. I do not know that greater prosperity has
ever been achieved in a shorter time by a commercial company. I think
our friend here, Mr. Montague, should be as feelingly aware of that
as any gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by that, Mr. Melmotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>asked Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I mean?--Certainly nothing adverse to your character, sir.
Your firm in San Francisco, sir, know very well how the affairs of
the Company are being transacted on this side of the water. No doubt
you are in correspondence with Mr. Fisker. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). The telegraph
wires are open to you, sir. But, my Lords and Gentlemen, I am able
to inform you that in affairs of this nature great discretion is
necessary. On behalf of the shareholders at large whose interests
are in our hands, I think it expedient that any general statement
should be postponed for a short time, and I flatter myself that in
that opinion I shall carry the majority of this Board with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Melmotte did not make his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) speech very fluently; but, being accustomed
to the place which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) occupied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did manage to get the words spoken
in such a way as to make them intelligible to the company. <div class="bookquote">``I now
move that this meeting be adjourned to this day week,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I second that motion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Lord Alfred, without moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) hand
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understood that we were to have a statement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Montague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've had a statement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cohenlupe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will put my motion to the vote,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chairman</b></font>)</div>said the Chairman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall move an amendment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul, determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chairman</b></font>) would not
be altogether silenced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nobody to second it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cohenlupe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know till I've made it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the rebel</b></font>)</div>asked the rebel. <div class="bookquote">``I shall ask
Lord Nidderdale to second it, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) has heard it I think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) will not refuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, gracious me! why me? No;--don't ask me. I've got to go away. I
have indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate I claim the right of saying a few words. I do not say
whether every affair of this Company should or should not be
published to the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd break up everything if you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Cohenlupe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps everything ought to be broken up. But I say nothing about
that. What I do say is this. That as we sit here as directors and
will be held to be responsible as such by the public, we ought to
know what is being done. We ought to know where the shares really
are. I for one do not even know what scrip has been issued.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've bought and sold enough to know something about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said
Melmotte.

<p/>Paul Montague became very red in the face. <div class="bookquote">``I, at any rate, began,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``by putting what was to me a large sum of money into the
affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's more than I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever shares you have,
were issued at San Francisco, and not here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have taken nothing that I haven't paid for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Montague. <div class="bookquote">``Nor
have I yet had allotted to me anything like the number of shares
which my capital would represent. But I did not intend to speak of my
own concerns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks very like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Cohenlupe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So far from it that I am prepared to risk the not improbable loss of
everything I have in the world. I am determined to know what is being
done with the shares, or to make it public to the world at large
that I, one of the directors of the Company, do not in truth know
anything about it. I cannot, I suppose, absolve myself from further
responsibility; but I can at any rate do what is right from this time
forward,--and that course I intend to take.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The gentleman had better resign his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seat at this Board,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said
Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``There will be no difficulty about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bound up as I am with Fisker and Montague in California I fear that
there will be difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chairman</b></font>)</div>continued the Chairman. <div class="bookquote">``You need only gazette
your resignation and the thing is done. I had intended, gentlemen, to
propose an addition to our number. When I name to you a gentleman,
personally known to many of you, and generally esteemed throughout
England as a man of business, as a man of probity, and as a man of
fortune, a man standing deservedly high in all British circles, I
mean Mr. Longestaffe of Caversham--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Young Dolly, or old?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean Mr. Adolphus Longestaffe, senior, of Caversham. I am sure
that you will all be glad to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) among you. I had thought
to strengthen our number by this addition. But if Mr. Montague
is determined to leave us,--and no one will regret the loss of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) services so much as I shall,--it will be my pleasing duty to
move that Adolphus Longestaffe, senior, Esquire, of Caversham, be
requested to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) place. If on reconsideration Mr. Montague shall
determine to remain with us,--and I for one most sincerely hope that
such reconsideration may lead to such determination,--then I shall
move that an additional director be added to our number, and that
Mr. Longestaffe be requested to take the chair of that additional
director.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>The latter speech Mr. Melmotte got through very glibly,
and then immediately left the chair, so as to show that the business
of the Board was closed for that day without any possibility of
reopening it.

<p/>Paul went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) by the sleeve, signifying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
wished to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) before they parted. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the
great man bowing. <div class="bookquote">``Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, looking round on the young
baronet with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blandest smile, <div class="bookquote">``if you are not in a hurry, wait a
moment for me. I have a word or two to say before you go. Now, Mr.
Montague, what can I do for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>Paul began his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story, expressing
again the opinion which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already very plainly expressed at the
table. But Melmotte stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) very shortly, and with much less
courtesy than he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had shown in the speech which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had made from the
chair. <div class="bookquote">``The thing is about this way, I take it, Mr. Montague;--you
think you know more of this matter than I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think that I know more of it than you do. Either of us may
be right. But as I don't intend to give way to you, perhaps the
less we speak together about it the better. You can't be in earnest
in the threat you made, because you would be making public things
communicated to you under the seal of privacy,--and no gentleman
would do that. But as long as you are hostile to me, I can't help
you;--and so good afternoon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Then, without giving Montague the
possibility of a reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) escaped into an inner room which had the
word <div class="bookquote">``Private''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>painted on the door, and which was supposed to belong
to the chairman individually. He (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) shut the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>), and then,
after a few moments, put out his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) head and beckoned to Sir Felix
Carbury. Nidderdale was gone. Lord Alfred with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) son were already
on the stairs. Cohenlupe was engaged with Melmotte's clerk on the
record-book. Paul Montague finding himself without support and alone,
slowly made his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) way out into the court.

<p/>Sir Felix had come into the city intending to suggest to the Chairman
that having paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Chairman</b></font>) thousand pounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Chairman</b></font>) should like to have a few
shares to go on with. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chairman</b></font>) was, indeed, at the present moment very
nearly penniless, and had negotiated, or lost at cards, all the
I.O.U.``s which were in any degree serviceable. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) still had a
pocket-book full of those issued by Miles Grendall; but it was now an
understood thing at the Beargarden that no one was to be called upon
to take them except Miles Grendall himself;--an arrangement which
robbed the card-table of much of its delight. Beyond this, also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
had lately been forced to issue a little paper himself,--in doing
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had talked largely of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) shares in the railway. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) case
certainly was hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had actually paid a thousand pounds down in
hard cash, a commercial transaction which, as performed by himself,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) regarded as stupendous. It was almost incredible to himself that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) should have paid any one a thousand pounds, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had done it
with much difficulty,--having carried Dolly junior with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) all the
way into the city,--in the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) would thus put himself in
the way of making a continual and unfailing income. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) understood
that as a director he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) would be always entitled to buy shares at par,
and, as a matter of course, always able to sell them at the market
price. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) understood to range from ten to fifteen and twenty per
cent. profit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) would have nothing to do but to buy and sell daily.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was told that Lord Alfred was allowed to do it to a small extent;
and that Melmotte was doing it to an enormous extent. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
could do it he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must get something,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hardly knew what,--out of
Melmotte's hands. Melmotte certainly did not seem disposed to shun
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and therefore there could be no difficulty about the shares. As
to danger;--who could think of danger in reference to money intrusted
to the hands of Augustus Melmotte?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted to see you here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
cordially by the hand. <div class="bookquote">``You come regularly, and you'll find that it
will be worth your while. There's nothing like attending to business.
You should be here every Friday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And let me see you sometimes up at my place in Abchurch Lane. I can
put you more in the way of understanding things there than I can
here. This is all a mere formal sort of thing. You can see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are obliged to have this kind of thing for men like that fellow
Montague. By-the-bye, is he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) a friend of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not particularly. He (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) is a friend of a cousin of mine; and the women
know him (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) isn't a pal of mine if you mean that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) makes himself disagreeable, he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>)'ll have to go to the
wall;--that's all. But never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) at present. Was your mother
speaking to you of what I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, staring with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) about you, and I thought that perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might
have told you. This is all nonsense, you know, about you and Marie.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix looked into the man's face. It was not savage, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
seen it. But there had suddenly come upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brow that heavy look
of a determined purpose which all who knew the man were wont to mark.
Sir Felix had observed it a few minutes since in the Board-room,
when the chairman was putting down the rebellious director. <div class="bookquote">``You
understand that; don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix still looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>), but made
no reply. <div class="bookquote">``It's all d-- nonsense. You haven't got a brass farthing,
you know. You've no income at all; you're just living on your mother,
and I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not very well off. How can you suppose that I
shall give my girl to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Felix still looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) but did not
dare to contradict a single statement made. Yet when the man told
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not a brass farthing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own thousand
pounds which were now in the man's pocket. <div class="bookquote">``You're a baronet, and
that's about all, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>continued Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``The Carbury
property, which is a very small thing, belongs to a distant cousin
who may leave it to me if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) pleases;--and who isn't very much older
than you are yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come, Mr. Melmotte; he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s a great deal older than me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't matter if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were as old as Adam. The thing is out of
the question, and you must drop it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then the look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brow became
a little heavier. <div class="bookquote">``You hear what I say. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is going to marry Lord
Nidderdale. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) before you ever saw her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). What do
you expect to get by it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix had not the courage to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) expected to get the girl
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) loved. But as the man waited for an answer he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obliged to say
something. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's the old story,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so;--the old story. You want my money, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wants you, just
because she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has been told to take somebody else. You want something
to live on;--that's what you want. Come;--out with it. Is not that
it? When we understand each other I'll put you in the way of making
money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm not very well off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About as badly as any young man that I can hear of. You give me your
written promise that you'll drop this affair with Marie, and you
shan't want for money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A written promise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--a written promise. I give nothing for nothing. I'll put you in
the way of doing so well with these shares that you shall be able to
marry any other girl you please;--or to live without marrying, which
you'll find to be better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something worthy of consideration in Mr. Melmotte's
proposition. Marriage of itself, simply as a domestic institution,
had not specially recommended itself to Sir Felix Carbury. A few
horses at Leighton, Ruby Ruggles or any other beauty, and life at the
Beargarden were much more to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leighton</b></font>) taste. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leighton</b></font>) was quite alive
to the fact that it was possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leighton</b></font>) might find himself possessed
of the wife without the money. Marie, indeed, had a grand plan of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
own, with reference to that settled income; but then Marie might be
mistaken,--or she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) might be lying. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Leighton</b></font>) were sure of making money in
the way Melmotte now suggested, the loss of Marie would not break
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) heart. But then also Melmotte might be--lying. <div class="bookquote">``By-the-bye, Mr.
Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``could you let me have those shares?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shares?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the heavy brow became still heavier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know?--I gave you a thousand pounds, and I was to have ten
shares.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must come about that on the proper day, to the proper place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When is the proper day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the twentieth of each month I think.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix looked very
blank at hearing this, knowing that this present was the twenty-first
of the month. <div class="bookquote">``But what does that signify? Do you want a little
money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``A lot of fellows owe me money, but
it's so hard to get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That tells a story of gambling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``You think I'd
give my girl to a gambler?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nidderdale's in it quite as thick as I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nidderdale has a settled property which neither he (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) nor his (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) father
can destroy. But don't you be such a fool as to argue with me. You
won't get anything by it. If you'll write that letter here now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What;--to Marie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--not to Marie at all; but to me. It need never be shown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>).
If you'll do that I'll stick to you and make a man of you. And if you
want a couple of hundred pounds I'll give you a cheque for it before
you leave the room. Mind, I can tell you this. On my word of honour
as a gentleman, if my daughter were to marry you, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'d never have a
single shilling. I should immediately make a will and leave all my
property to St. George's Hospital. I have quite made up my mind about
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And couldn't you manage that I should have the shares before the
twentieth of next month?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see about it. Perhaps I could let you have a few of my own. At
any rate I won't see you short of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The terms were enticing and the letter was of course written.
Melmotte himself dictated the words, which were not romantic in their
nature. The reader shall see the letter.


<p/>DEAR SIR,

<p/>In consideration of the offers made by you to me, and
on a clear understanding that such a marriage would be
disagreeable to you and to the lady's mother, and would
bring down a father's curse upon your daughter, I hereby
declare and promise that I will not renew my suit to the
young lady, which I hereby altogether renounce.

<p/>I am, Dear Sir,
Your obedient Servant,

<p/>FELIX CARBURY.

<p/>AUGUSTUS MELMOTTE, Esq.,
--, Grosvenor Square.


<p/>The letter was dated 21st July, and bore the printed address of the
offices of the South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll give me that cheque for #200, Mr. Melmotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>The financier</b></font>)</div>The financier
hesitated for a moment, but did give the baronet the cheque as
promised. <div class="bookquote">``And you'll see about letting me have those shares?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can come to me in Abchurch Lane, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) would call in Abchurch Lane.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) went westward towards the Beargarden, the baronet was not happy
in his (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) mind. Ignorant as he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) was as to the duties of a gentleman,
indifferent as he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) was to the feelings of others, still he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) felt
ashamed of himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) was treating the girl very badly. Even he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) knew
that he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) was behaving badly. He (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) was so conscious of it that he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) tried
to console himself by reflecting that his (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) writing such a letter as
that would not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) running away with the girl, should he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>), on
consideration, find it to be worth his (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) while to do so.

<p/>That night he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) was again playing at the Beargarden, and he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) lost a
great part of Mr. Melmotte's money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did in fact lose much more
than the #200; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ready money going from him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
issued paper.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII.

<p/>PAUL MONTAGUE``S TROUBLES.


<p/>Paul Montague had other troubles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind beyond this trouble of
the Mexican Railway. It was now more than a fortnight since he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
taken Mrs. Hurtle to the play, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was still living in lodgings
at Islington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) twice, once on the following day,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was allowed to come and go without any special reference to
their engagement, and again, three or four days afterwards, when the
meeting was by no means so pleasant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had wept, and after weeping
had stormed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had stood upon what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) rights, and
had dared him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to be false to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mean to deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
promised to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)? Was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) conduct to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
now been in London, a repetition of that promise? And then again she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
became soft, and pleaded with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). But for the storm he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might have
given way. At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had felt that any fate in life would be
better than a marriage on compulsion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) tears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) pleadings,
nevertheless, touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) very nearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) most
distinctly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) and had won her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) love. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was
lovely. The very violence of the storm made the sunshine more sweet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would sit down on a stool at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) feet, and it was impossible to
drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would look up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could
not but embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). Then there had come a passionate flood of tears
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) arms. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had escaped he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hardly knew, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
did know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had promised to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) again before two days
should have passed.

<p/>On the day named he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) a letter excusing himself, which
was at any rate true in words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been summoned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, to
Liverpool on business, and must postpone seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) till his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) return.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) explained that the business on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was called was
connected with the great American railway, and, being important,
demanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) attention. In words this was true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been
corresponding with a gentleman at Liverpool with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had become
acquainted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) return home after having involuntarily become a
partner in the house of Fisker, Montague, and Montague. This man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
trusted and had consulted, and the gentleman, Mr. Ramsbottom by name,
had suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) should come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) at Liverpool. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) had gone,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) conduct at the Board had been the result of the advice which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) had received; but it may be doubted whether some dread of the
coming interview with Mrs. Hurtle had not added strength to Mr.
Ramsbottom's invitation.

<p/>In Liverpool he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) had heard tidings of Mrs. Hurtle, though it can
hardly be said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) obtained any trustworthy information. The lady
after landing from an American steamer had been at Mr. Ramsbottom's
office, inquiring for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>), Paul; and Mr. Ramsbottom had thought
that the inquiries were made in a manner indicating danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>)
therefore had spoken to a fellow-traveller with Mrs. Hurtle, and the
fellow-traveller had opined that Mrs. Hurtle was <div class="bookquote">``a queer card.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On
board ship we all gave it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was about the handsomest
woman we had ever seen, but we all said that there was a bit of the
wild cat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) breeding.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ramsbottom</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Ramsbottom had asked whether the
lady was a widow. <div class="bookquote">``There was a man on board from Kansas,''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow-traveller</b></font>)</div>said the
fellow-traveller, <div class="bookquote">``who knew a man named Hurtle at Leavenworth, who
was separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and is still alive. There was, according
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), a queer story about the man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife having fought a duel
with pistols, and then having separated.''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow-traveller</b></font>)</div>This Mr. Ramsbottom, who in
an earlier stage of the affair had heard something of Paul and Mrs.
Hurtle together, managed to communicate to the young man. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advice
about the railway company was very clear and general, and such as
an honest man would certainly give; but it might have been conveyed
by letter. The information, such as it was, respecting Mrs. Hurtle,
could only be given vivâ voce, and perhaps the invitation to
Liverpool had originated in Mr. Ramsbottom's appreciation of this
fact. <div class="bookquote">``As she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was asking after you here, perhaps it is as well that
you should know,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) friend said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>). Paul had only thanked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>), not daring on the spur of the moment to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) own
difficulties.

<p/>In all this there had been increased dismay, but there had also
been some comfort. It had only been at moments in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) had been
subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) softer influences that Paul had doubted as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>)
adherence to the letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), breaking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>)
engagement. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wrongs and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love; of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>)
promise and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) former devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>); when she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had given up everything in life for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>), and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arms
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>), looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) eyes;--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) would almost yield. But
when, what the traveller called the breeding of the wild cat, showed
itself;--and when, having escaped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) thought of Hetta
Carbury and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) breeding,--he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) was fully determined that, let his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>)
fate be what it might, it should not be that of being the husband of
Mrs. Hurtle. That he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in a mass of troubles from which it would be
very difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to extricate himself he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was well aware;--but
if it were true that Mr. Hurtle was alive, that fact might help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) certainly had declared him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to be,--not separated, or even
divorced,--but dead. And if it were true also that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had fought a
duel with one husband, that also ought to be a reason why a gentleman
should object to become her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) second husband. These facts would at any
rate justify himself to himself, and would enable himself to break
from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) engagement without thinking himself to be a false traitor.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must make up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind as to some line of conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) must be
made to know the truth. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) meant to reject the lady finally on
the score of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) being a wild cat, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) so. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt very
strongly that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must not flinch from the wild cat's claws. That he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
would have to undergo some severe handling, an amount of clawing
which might perhaps go near his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could perceive. Having done
what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had done he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have no right to shrink from such usage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
past life, and that therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
might write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>);--but when summoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) presence he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would be
unable to excuse himself, even to himself, for not going. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
misfortune,--and also his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fault,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had submitted to be loved
by a wild cat.

<p/>But it might be well that before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should get hold of
information that might have the appearance of real evidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
returned from Liverpool to London on the morning of the Friday on
which the Board was held, and thought even more of all this than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
did of the attack which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was prepared to make on Mr. Melmotte. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could come across that traveller he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might learn something. The
husband's name had been Caradoc Carson Hurtle. If Caradoc Carson
Hurtle had been seen in the State of Kansas within the last two
years, that certainly would be sufficient evidence. As to the duel he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
felt that it might be very hard to prove that, and that if proved, it
might be hard to found upon the fact any absolute right on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) part
to withdraw from the engagement. But there was a rumour also, though
not corroborated during his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last visit to Liverpool, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
shot a gentleman in Oregon. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) get at the truth of that story?
If they were all true, surely he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could justify himself to himself.

<p/>But this detective's work was very distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). After having
had the woman in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms how could he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) undertake such inquiries as
these? And it would be almost necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms again while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was making them,--unless indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) made them
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knowledge. Was it not his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) duty, as a man, to tell everything
to herself? To speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thus;--<div class="bookquote">``I am told that your life with
your last husband was, to say the least of it, eccentric; that you
even fought a duel with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). I could not marry a woman who had fought
a duel,--certainly not a woman who had fought with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own husband.
I am told also that you shot another gentleman in Oregon. It may well
be that the gentleman deserved to be shot; but there is something
in the deed so repulsive to me,--no doubt irrationally,--that, on
that score also, I must decline to marry you. I am told also that
Mr. Hurtle has been seen alive quite lately. I had understood from
you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is dead. No doubt you may have been deceived. But as I
should not have engaged myself to you had I known the truth, so now
I consider myself justified in absolving myself from an engagement
which was based on a misconception.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It would no doubt be difficult
to get through all these details; but it might be accomplished
gradually,--unless in the process of doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should incur the
fate of the gentleman in Oregon. At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would declare to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could the ground on which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) claimed a right to
consider himself free, and would bear the consequences. Such was the
resolve which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) made on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) journey up from Liverpool, and that
trouble was also on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rose up to attack Mr. Melmotte
single-handed at the Board.

<p/>When the Board was over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) also went down to the Beargarden.
Perhaps, with reference to the Board, the feeling which hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) most
was the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was spending money which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would never
have had to spend had there been no Board. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been twitted with
this at the Board-meeting, and had justified himself by referring to
the money which had been invested in the Company of Fisker, Montague,
and Montague, which money was now supposed to have been made over
to the railway. But the money which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was spending had come to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) after a loose fashion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) knew that if called upon for an
account, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) could hardly make out one which would be square and
intelligible to all parties. Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) spent much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) time
at the Beargarden, dining there when no engagement carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
elsewhere. On this evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) table with Nidderdale's,
at the young lord's instigation. <div class="bookquote">``What made you so savage at old
Melmotte to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>said the young lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to be savage, but I think that as we call ourselves
Directors we ought to know something about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we ought. I don't know, you know. I'll tell you what I've
been thinking. I can't make out why the mischief they made me a
Director.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you're a lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul bluntly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose there's something in that. But what good can I do them?
Nobody thinks that I know anything about business. Of course I'm in
Parliament, but I don't often go there unless they want me to vote.
Everybody knows that I'm hard up. I can't understand it. The Governor
said that I was to do it, and so I've done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say, you know,--there's something between you and Melmotte's
daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if there is, what has that to do with a railway in the city? And
why should Carbury be there? And, heaven and earth, why should old
Grendall be a Director? I'm impecunious; but if you were to pick out
the two most hopeless men in London in regard to money, they would be
old Grendall and young Carbury. I've been thinking a good deal about
it, and I can't make it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking about it too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose old Melmotte is all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>asked Nidderdale. This was a
question which Montague found it difficult to answer. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) be
justified in whispering suspicions to the man who was known to be at
any rate one of the competitors for Marie Melmotte's hand? <div class="bookquote">``You can
speak out to me, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got nothing to speak. People say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is about the richest
man alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lives as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why it shouldn't be all true. Nobody, I take it, knows
very much about him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) companion had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), Nidderdale sat
down, thinking of it all. It occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``be coming
a cropper rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) to marry Melmotte's daughter for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
money, and then find that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had got none.

<p/>A little later in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) invited Montague to go up to the
card-room. <div class="bookquote">``Carbury, and Grasslough, and Dolly Longestaffe are there
waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said. But Paul declined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was too full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) troubles
for play. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Miles isn't there, if you're afraid of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said
Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miles Grendall wouldn't hinder me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Montague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor me either. Of course it's a confounded shame. I know that
as well as any body. But, God bless me, I owe a fellow down in
Leicestershire heaven knows how much for keeping horses, and that's
a shame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll pay him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I shall,--if I don't die first. But I should have gone on
with the horses just the same if there had never been anything to
come;--only they wouldn't have given me tick, you know. As far as I'm
concerned it's just the same. I like to live whether I've got money
or not. And I fear I don't have many scruples about paying. But then
I like to let live too. There's Carbury always saying nasty things
about poor Miles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)'s playing himself without a rap to back him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>). If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) were to lose, Vossner wouldn't stand him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) a #10 note. But because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) has won, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) goes on as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) were old Melmotte himself. You'd
better come up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>But Montague wouldn't go up. Without any fixed purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) left the
club, and slowly sauntered northwards through the streets till he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
found himself in Welbeck Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) hardly knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) went there,
and certainly had not determined to call on Lady Carbury when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) left
the Beargarden. His (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) mind was full of Mrs. Hurtle. As long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was
present in London,--as long at any rate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was unable to tell
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had finally broken away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) knew himself
to be an unfit companion for Henrietta Carbury. And, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
was still under some promise made to Roger Carbury, not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
would avoid Hetta's company, but that for a certain period, as yet
unexpired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wife. It had been a foolish
promise, made and then repented without much attention to words;--but
still it was existing, and Paul knew well that Roger trusted that it
would be kept. Nevertheless Paul made his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) way up to Welbeck Street
and almost unconsciously knocked at the door. No;--Lady Carbury was
not at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was out somewhere with Mr. Roger Carbury. Up to that
moment Paul had not heard that Roger was in town; but the reader may
remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had come up in search of Ruby Ruggles. Miss Carbury
was at home, the page went on to say. Would Mr. Montague go up and
see Miss Carbury? Without much consideration Mr. Montague said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would go up and see Miss Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma is out with Roger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said
Hetta endeavouring to save herself from confusion. <div class="bookquote">``There is a soirée
of learned people somewhere, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) made poor Roger take her (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>). The
ticket was only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) friend, and therefore I could not
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to see you. What an age it is since we met.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly since the Melmottes' ball,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly indeed. I have been here once since that. What has brought
Roger up to town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what it is. Some mystery, I think. Whenever there is a
mystery I am always afraid that there is something wrong about Felix.
I do get so unhappy about Felix, Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) to-day in the city, at the Railway Board.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Roger says the Railway Board is all a sham,'' (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>--Paul could not

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What man, Miss Carbury?''

says it;--or, at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) never says anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) doesn't think.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spent a thousand pounds, everybody would know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)'d got it

that you say,--and more. You hardly know how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) denies himself, and
how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks of everybody near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a gentleman all round and
every inch. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never lies. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never takes what is not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta/Henrietta Carbury/HENRIETTA CARBURY</b></font>)</div>said Henrietta;--for at that moment there was a
double knock at the door.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I DO LOVE HIM.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So it was. Lady Carbury had returned home from the soirée of learned
people, and had brought Roger Carbury with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). They both came up
to the drawing-room and found Paul and Henrietta together. It need
hardly be said that they were both surprised. Roger supposed that
Montague was still at Liverpool, and, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was not a
frequent visitor in Welbeck Street, could hardly avoid a feeling
that a meeting between the two had now been planned in the mother's
absence. The reader knows that it was not so. Roger certainly was a
man not liable to suspicion, but the circumstances in this case were
suspicious. There would have been nothing to suspect,--no reason why
Paul should not have been there,--but from the promise which had been
given. There was, indeed, no breach of that promise proved by Paul's
presence in Welbeck Street; but Roger felt rather than thought that
the two could hardly have spent the evening together without such
breach. Whether Paul had broken the promise by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had already
said the reader must be left to decide.

<p/>Lady Carbury was the first to speak. <div class="bookquote">``This is quite an unexpected
pleasure, Mr. Montague.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Whether Roger suspected anything or not,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did. The moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) saw Paul the idea occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that the
meeting between Hetta and him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been preconcerted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said,--making a lame excuse, where no excuse should have
been made,--<div class="bookquote">``I had nothing to do, and was lonely, and thought that I
would come up and see you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury disbelieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) altogether,
but Roger felt assured that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) coming in Lady Carbury's absence had
been an accident. The man had said so, and that was enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were at Liverpool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came back to-day,--to be present at that Board in the city. I have
had a good deal to trouble me. I will tell you all about it just now.
What has brought you to London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/>Then there was an awkward silence. Lady Carbury was angry, and hardly
knew whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ought or ought not to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) anger. For Henrietta
it was very awkward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), too, could not but feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had been
caught, though no innocence could be whiter than hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) knew well
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother's mind, and the way in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother's thoughts would
run. Silence was frightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) found herself forced to
speak. <div class="bookquote">``Have you had a pleasant evening, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you had a pleasant evening, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury,
forgetting herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) desire to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, attempting to laugh, <div class="bookquote">``I have been trying to
work hard at Dante, but one never does any good when one has to try
to work. I was just going to bed when Mr. Montague came in. What did
you think of the wise men and the wise women, Roger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was out of my element, of course; but I think your mother liked
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very glad indeed to meet Dr. Palmoil. It seems that if we
can only open the interior of Africa a little further, we can get
everything that is wanted to complete the chemical combination
necessary for feeding the human race. Isn't that a grand idea,
Roger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little more elbow grease is the combination that I look to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, Roger, if the Bible is to go for anything, we are to believe
that labour is a curse and not a blessing. Adam was not born to
labour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) fell; and I doubt whether Dr. Palmoil will be able to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)
descendants back into Eden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger, for a religious man, you do say the strangest things! I have
quite made up my mind to this;--if ever I can see things so settled
here as to enable me to move, I will visit the interior of Africa. It
is the garden of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>This scrap of enthusiasm so carried them through their immediate
difficulties that the two men were able to take their leave and to
get out of the room with fair comfort. As soon as the door was closed
behind them Lady Carbury attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter. <div class="bookquote">``What brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brought himself, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't answer me in that way, Hetta. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) brought himself.
That is insolent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Insolent, mamma! How can you say such hard words? I meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
came of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own accord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long was he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two minutes before you came in. Why do you cross-question me like
this? I could not help his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) coming. I did not desire that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might be
shown up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was to come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, if I am to be suspected, all is over between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can think that I would deceive you, you will think so always.
If you will not trust me, how am I to live with you as though you
did? I knew nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me this, Hetta; are you engaged to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I am not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) asked you to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta paused a moment, considering, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) answered this
question. <div class="bookquote">``I do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ever has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going on to explain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) never has asked me. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has said
that which makes me know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wishes me to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said? When did he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) say it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) paused. But again she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) answered with straightforward
simplicity. <div class="bookquote">``Just before you came in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said--; I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
said; but it meant that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been here but a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was but very little more. If you take me at my word in that way,
of course you can make me out to be wrong, mamma. It was almost no
time, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had come prepared to say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),--expecting to find you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) expected nothing of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you do him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wrong, mamma. I am sure you are doing me wrong.
I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) coming was an accident, and that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said was--an
accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An accident!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not intended,--not then, mamma. I have known it ever so
long;--and so have you. It was natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should say so when we
were alone together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you;--what did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. You came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry that my coming should have been so inopportune. But I
must ask one other question, Hetta. What do you intend to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta
was again silent, and now for a longer space. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) brow and pushed back her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hair as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother
had a right to continue this cross-examination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
mother everything as it had happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had kept back no deed done,
no word spoken, either now or at any time. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was not sure that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother had a right to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thoughts, feeling as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had so little sympathy from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``How do you intend to
answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>demanded Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will ask again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is prevaricating.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mamma;--I do not prevaricate. It is unfair to say that to me.
I do love him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). There. I think it ought to have been enough for you to
know that I should never give him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) encouragement without telling you
about it. I do love him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and I shall never love any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is a ruined man. Your cousin says that all this Company in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is involved will go to pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta was too clever to allow this argument to pass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not
doubt that Roger had so spoken of the Railway to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
did doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother had believed the story. <div class="bookquote">``If so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Melmotte will be a ruined man too, and yet you want Felix to
marry Marie Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me ill to hear you talk,--as if you understood these
things. And you think you will marry this man because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to make a
fortune out of the Railway!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury was able to speak with an
extremity of scorn in reference to the assumed pursuit by one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
children of an advantageous position which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was doing all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
power to recommend to the other child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune. I have not thought of marrying

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why will you not marry your cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; you say so. But that is what I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is so much above

And I have told you that I do love some one else. I have no secret

and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do be kind to me; and pray,--pray,--do believe me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury then allowed herself to be kissed, and allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
daughter to leave the room.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Lady Carbury allowed herself to be kissed.-RSB-


<p/>There was a great deal said that night between Roger Carbury and
Paul Montague before they parted. As they walked together to Roger's
hotel he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said not a word as to Paul's presence in Welbeck Street.
Paul had declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) visit in Lady Carbury's absence to have
been accidental,--and therefore there was nothing more to be said.
Montague then asked as to the cause of Carbury's journey to London.
<div class="bookquote">``I do not wish it to be talked of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger after a pause,--<div class="bookquote">``and
of course I could not speak of it before Hetta. A girl has gone away
from our neighbourhood. You remember old Ruggles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not mean that Ruby has levanted? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was to have married John
Crumb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) has gone off, leaving John Crumb in an unhappy
frame of mind. John Crumb is an honest man and almost too good for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ruby is very pretty. Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) gone with any one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) went alone. But the horror of it is this. They think down
there that Felix has,--well, made love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) has been
taken to London by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly has known her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lied, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always lies, when
I first spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had
been friends down in Suffolk. Of course we know what such friendship
means. But I do not think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) came to London at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instance. Of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would lie about that. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would lie about anything. If his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
horse cost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a hundred pounds, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would tell one man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave
fifty, and another two hundred. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not lived long enough yet
to be able to lie and tell the truth with the same eye. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is as
old as I am he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be perfect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) coming to town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not when I first asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I am not sure, but I fancy that
I was too quick after her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) started last Saturday morning. I
followed on the Sunday, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) club. I think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knew nothing then of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) being in town. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very clever if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did.
Since that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has avoided me. I caught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once but only for half a
minute, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You still believed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it very well, but I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was prepared for me.
I cannot say how it may have been. To make matters worse old Ruggles
has now quarrelled with Crumb, and is no longer anxious to get back
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) granddaughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was frightened at first; but that has gone off,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is now reconciled to the loss of the girl and the saving of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>After that Paul told all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own story,--the double story, both in
regard to Melmotte and to Mrs. Hurtle. As regarded the Railway, Roger
could only tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to follow explicitly the advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) Liverpool
friend. <div class="bookquote">``I never believed in the thing, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor did I. But what could I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to blame you. Indeed, knowing you as I do, feeling
sure that you intend to be honest, I would not for a moment insist on
my own opinion, if it did not seem that Mr. Ramsbottom thinks as I
do. In such a matter, when a man does not see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own way clearly,
it behoves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be able to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has followed the advice
of some man whom the world esteems and recognises. You have to bind
your character to another man's character; and that other man's
character, if it be good, will carry you through. From what I hear
Mr. Ramsbottom's character is sufficiently good;--but then you must
do exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) tells you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>But the Railway business, though it comprised all that Montague had
in the world, was not the heaviest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) troubles. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to
do about Mrs. Hurtle? He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had now, for the first time, to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
friend that Mrs. Hurtle had come to London, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) three or four times. There was this difficulty in the matter,
too,--that it was very hard to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) engagement with Mrs.
Hurtle without in some sort alluding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love for Henrietta
Carbury. Roger knew of both loves;--had been very urgent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
friend to abandon the widow, and at any rate equally urgent with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
to give up the other passion. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to marry the widow, all danger
on the other side would be at an end. And yet, in discussing the
question of Mrs. Hurtle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was to do so as though there were no such
person existing as Henrietta Carbury. The discussion did take place
exactly as though there were no such person as Henrietta Carbury.
Paul told it all,--the rumoured duel, the rumoured murder, and the
rumour of the existing husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be necessary that you should go out to Kansas,--and to
Oregon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But even if the rumours be untrue I will not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.
Roger shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was doubtless thinking of Hetta
Carbury, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``And what would she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) do, remaining
here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>continued Paul. Roger admitted that it would be awkward. <div class="bookquote">``I
am determined that under no circumstances will I marry her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). I know
I have been a fool. I know I have been wrong. But of course, if there
be a fair cause for my broken word, I will use it if I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will get out of it, honestly if you can; but you will get out of
it honestly or--any other way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you not advise me to get out of it, Roger;--before we knew as
much as we do now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did,--and I do. If you make a bargain with the Devil, it may be
dishonest to cheat him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>),--and yet I would have you cheat him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) if you
could. As to this woman, I do believe she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has deceived you. If I were
you, nothing should induce me to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>);--not though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) claws
were strong enough to tear me utterly in pieces. I'll tell you what
I'll do. I'll go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if you like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>But Paul would not submit to this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was bound himself
to incur the risk of those claws, and that no substitute could take
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) place. They sat long into the night, and it was at last resolved
between them that on the next morning Paul should go to Islington,
should tell Mrs. Hurtle all the stories which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had heard, and
should end by declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) resolution that under no circumstances
would he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). They both felt how improbable it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
should ever be allowed to get to the end of such a story,--how almost
certain it was that the breeding of the wild cat would show itself
before that time should come. But, still, that was the course to be
pursued as far as circumstances would admit; and Paul was at any rate
to declare, claws or no claws, husband or no husband,--whether the
duel or the murder was admitted or denied,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would never make
Mrs. Hurtle his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``I wish it were over, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) leave.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went to bed like a man condemned to die on the next morning, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) awoke in the same condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had slept well, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) shook
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) happy dream, the wretched reality at once overwhelmed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). But the man who is to be hung has no choice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wakes, declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has changed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, and postpone the hour.
It was quite open to Paul Montague to give himself such instant
relief. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brow, and almost made himself
believe that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head was aching. This was Saturday. Would it not be
well that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should think of it further, and put off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) execution
till Monday? Monday was so far distant that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could go
to Islington quite comfortably on Monday. Was there not some hitherto
forgotten point which it would be well that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should discuss with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend Roger before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the lady? Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not rush down to
Liverpool, and ask a few more questions of Mr. Ramsbottom? Why should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) go forth to execution, seeing that the matter was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) own
hands?

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) jumped out of bed and into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) tub, and dressed himself
as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) worked himself up into a fit of fortitude,
and resolved that the thing should be done before the fit was over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) breakfast about nine, and then asked himself whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>)
might not be too early were he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) to go at once to Islington. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>)
remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) was always early. In every respect she (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) was an
energetic woman, using her (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) time for some purpose, either good or bad,
not sleeping it away in bed. If one has to be hung on a given day,
would it not be well to be hung as soon after waking as possible?
I can fancy that the hangman would hardly come early enough. And if
one had to be hung in a given week, would not one wish to be hung on
the first day of the week, even at the risk of breaking one's last
Sabbath day in this world? Whatever be the misery to be endured, get
it over. The horror of every agony is in its anticipation. Paul had
realised something of this when he (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) threw himself into a Hansom cab,
and ordered the man to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) to Islington.

<p/>How quick that cab went! Nothing ever goes so quick as a Hansom cab
when a man starts for a dinner-party a little too early;--nothing
so slow when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) starts too late. Of all cabs this, surely, was
the quickest. Paul was lodging in Suffolk Street, close to Pall
Mall,--whence the way to Islington, across Oxford Street, across
Tottenham Court Road, across numerous squares north-east of the
Museum, seems to be long. The end of Goswell Road is the outside
of the world in that direction, and Islington is beyond the end of
Goswell Road. And yet that Hansom cab was there before Paul Montague
had been able to arrange the words with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would begin the
interview. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given the street and the number of the street. It
was not till after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had started that it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that it
might be well that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should get out at the end of the street, and
walk to the house,--so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might, as it were, fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath
before the interview was commenced. But the cabman dashed up to the
door in a manner purposely devised to make every inmate of the house
aware that a cab had just arrived before it. There was a little
garden before the house. We all know the garden;--twenty-four feet
long, by twelve broad;--and an iron-grated door, with the landlady's
name on a brass plate. Paul, when he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) had paid the cabman,--giving the
man half-a-crown, and asking for no change in his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) agony,--pushed in
the iron gate and walked very quickly up to the door, rang rather
furiously, and before the door was well opened asked for Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Hurtle is out for the day,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl who opened the door.
<div class="bookquote">``Leastways, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) went out yesterday and won't be back till to-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Providence had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) a reprieve! But he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) almost forgot the
reprieve, as he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) looked at the girl and saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was Ruby Ruggles.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh laws, Mr. Montague, is that you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>Ruby Ruggles had often seen
Paul down in Suffolk, and recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). It
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) had come in search of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
knew that Roger Carbury was up in town looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). So much she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had of course learned from Sir Felix,--for at this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had seen
the baronet more than once since her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) arrival. Montague, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) knew,
was Roger Carbury's intimate friend, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was
caught. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) terror she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did not at first remember that the visitor
had asked for Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is I. I was sorry to hear, Miss Ruggles, that you had left
your home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all right, Mr. Montague;--I am. Mrs. Pipkin is my aunt, or,
leastways, my mother's brother's widow, though grandfather never
would speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'s quite respectable, and has five children,
and lets lodgings. There's a lady here now, and has gone away with
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) just for one night down to Southend. They'll be back this
evening, and I've the children to mind, with the servant girl. I'm
quite respectable here, Mr. Montague, and nobody need be a bit afraid
about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Hurtle has gone down to Southend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Montague; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) wasn't quite well, and wanted a breath of
air, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said. And aunt didn't like she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) should go alone, as Mrs.
Hurtle is such a stranger. And Mrs. Hurtle said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) didn't
mind paying for two, and so they've gone, and the baby with them.
Mrs. Pipkin said as the baby shouldn't be no trouble. And Mrs.
Hurtle,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)'s most as fond of the baby as aunt. Do you know Mrs.
Hurtle, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)'s a friend of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh; I didn't know. I did know as there was some friend as was
expected and as didn't come. Be I to say, sir, as you was here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul thought it might be as well to shift the subject and to ask Ruby
a few questions about herself while he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) mind what message
he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would leave for Mrs. Hurtle. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid they are very unhappy
about you down at Bungay, Miss Ruggles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they've got to be unhappy; that's all about it, Mr. Montague.
Grandfather is that provoking as a young woman can't live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),
nor yet I won't try never again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) lugged me all about the room by
my hair, Mr. Montague. How is a young woman to put up with that?
And I did everything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),--that careful that no one won't do it
again;--did his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) linen, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) victuals, and even cleaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) boots
of a Sunday, 'cause he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was that mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wouldn't have anybody about
the place only me and the girl who had to milk the cows. There wasn't
nobody to do anything, only me. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) went to drag me about
by the hairs of my head. You won't see me again at Sheep's Acre, Mr.
Montague;--nor yet won't the Squire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought there was somebody else was to give you a home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John Crumb! Oh, yes, there's John Crumb. There's plenty of people to
give me a home, Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were to have been married to John Crumb, I thought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ladies is to change their minds if they like it, Mr. Montague. I'm
sure you've heard that before. Grandfather made me say I'd have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),--but I never cared that for him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid, Miss Ruggles, you won't find a better man up here in
London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't come here to look for a man, Mr. Montague; I can tell you
that. They has to look for me, if they want me. But I am looked
after; and that by one as John Crumb ain't fit to touch.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That told
the whole story. Paul when he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) heard the little boast was quite sure
that Roger's fear about Felix was well founded. And as for John
Crumb's fitness to touch Sir Felix, Paul felt that the Bungay mealman
might have an opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own on that matter. <div class="bookquote">``But there's Betsy a
crying up-stairs, and I promised not to leave them children for one
minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell the Squire that I saw you, Miss Ruggles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does the Squire want o' me? I ain't nothing to the
Squire,--except that I respects him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). You can tell if you please, Mr.
Montague, of course. I'm a coming, my darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul made his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) way into Mrs. Hurtle's sitting-room and wrote a note
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in pencil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had come, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said, immediately on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) return
from Liverpool, and was sorry to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was away for the day.
When should he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) call again? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would make an appointment he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would
attend to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wrote this that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might very safely have
himself made an appointment for the morrow; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cheated himself
into half believing that the suggestion he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) now made was the more
gracious and civil. At any rate it would certainly give him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) another
day. Mrs. Hurtle would not return till late in the evening, and as
the following day was Sunday there would be no delivery by post.
When the note was finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) left it on the table, and called to
Ruby to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was going. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Montague,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) said in a
confidential whisper, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) tripped down the stairs, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see
why you need be saying anything about me, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carbury is up in town looking after you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What 'm I to Mr. Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your grandfather is very anxious about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it, Mr. Montague. Grandfather knows very well where
I am. There! Grandfather doesn't want me back, and I ain't a going.
Why should the Squire bother himself about me? I don't bother myself
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)'s afraid, Miss Ruggles, that you are trusting yourself to a young
man who is not trustworthy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can mind myself very well, Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me this. Have you seen Sir Felix Carbury since you've been in
town?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>Ruby, whose blushes came very easily, now flushed up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
forehead. <div class="bookquote">``You may be sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) means no good to you. What can
come of an intimacy between you and such a one as he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why I shouldn't have my friend, Mr. Montague, as well as
you. Howsomever, if you'll not tell, I'll be ever so much obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must tell Mr. Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I ain't obliged to you one bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby, shutting the door.

<p/>Paul as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) walked away could not help thinking of the justice of
Ruby's reproach to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). What business had he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to take upon himself to
be a Mentor to any one in regard to an affair of love;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>), who had
engaged himself to marry Mrs. Hurtle, and who the evening before had
for the first time declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) love to Hetta Carbury?

<p/>In regard to Mrs. Hurtle he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) had got a reprieve, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) thought, for
two days;--but it did not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) happy or even comfortable. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>)
walked back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) lodgings he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) knew it would have been better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>)
to have had the interview over. But, at any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) could now think
of Hetta Carbury, and the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) heard
that declaration which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) would have been
able for the hour to have forgotten Mrs. Hurtle.




<p/>CHAPTER XL.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``UNANIMITY IS THE VERY SOUL OF THESE THINGS.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>That evening Montague was surprised to receive at the Beargarden a
note from Mr. Melmotte, which had been brought thither by a messenger
from the city,--who had expected to have an immediate answer, as
though Montague lived at the club.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said the letter,


<p/>If not inconvenient would you call on me in Grosvenor
Square to-morrow, Sunday, at half past eleven. If you are
going to church, perhaps you will make an appointment in
the afternoon; if not, the morning will suit best. I want
to have a few words with you in private about the Company.
My messenger will wait for answer if you are at the club.

<p/>Yours truly,

<p/>AUGUSTUS MELMOTTE.

<p/>PAUL MONTAGUE, Esq.,
The Beargarden.


<p/>Paul immediately wrote to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>) would call at Grosvenor Square
at the hour appointed,--abandoning any intentions which he (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>) might have
had in reference to Sunday morning service. But this was not the only
letter he (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>) received that evening. On his (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>) return to his (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>) lodgings he (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>)
found a note, containing only one line, which Mrs. Hurtle had found
the means of sending to him (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>) after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) return from Southend. <div class="bookquote">``I am so
sorry to have been away. I will expect you all to-morrow. W. H.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
period of the reprieve was thus curtailed to less than a day.

<p/>On the Sunday morning he (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>) breakfasted late and then walked up to
Grosvenor Square, much pondering what the great man could have to
say to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The great man had declared himself very plainly in the
Board-room,--especially plainly after the Board had risen. Paul had
understood that war was declared, and had understood also that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
to fight the battle single-handed, knowing nothing of such strategy
as would be required, while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) antagonist was a great master of
financial tactics. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was prepared to go to the wall in reference to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, only hoping that in doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might save his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character
and keep the reputation of an honest man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite resolved
to be guided altogether by Mr. Ramsbottom, and intended to ask Mr.
Ramsbottom to draw up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) such a statement as would be fitting
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) to publish. But it was manifest now that Mr. Melmotte would
make some proposition, and it was impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should have Mr.
Ramsbottom at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) elbow to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been in Melmotte's house on the night of the ball, but had
contented himself after that with leaving a card. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had heard much
of the splendour of the place, but remembered simply the crush and
the crowd, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had danced there more than once or twice with
Hetta Carbury. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was shown into the hall he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was astonished to
find that it was not only stripped, but was full of planks, and
ladders, and trussels, and mortar. The preparations for the great
dinner had been already commenced. Through all this he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) way
to the stairs, and was taken up to a small room on the second floor,
where the servant told him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that Mr. Melmotte would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Here
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) waited a quarter of an hour looking out into the yard at the
back. There was not a book in the room, or even a picture with which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could amuse himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was beginning to think whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
personal dignity would not be best consulted by taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) departure,
when Melmotte himself, with slippers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) feet and enveloped in a
magnificent dressing-gown, bustled into the room. <div class="bookquote">``My dear sir, I am
so sorry. You are a punctual man I see. So am I. A man of business
should be punctual. But they ain't always. Brehgert,--from the house
of Todd, Brehgert, and Goldsheiner, you know,--has just been with
me. We had to settle something about the Moldavian loan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) came a
quarter late, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) went a quarter late. And how is a man
to catch a quarter of an hour? I never could do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Montague assured
the great man that the delay was of no consequence. <div class="bookquote">``And I am so
sorry to ask you into such a place as this. I had Brehgert in my
room down-stairs, and then the house is so knocked about! We get
into a furnished house a little way off in Bruton Street to-morrow.
Longestaffe lets me his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) house for a month till this affair of the
dinner is over. By-the-bye, Montague, if you'd like to come to the
dinner, I've got a ticket I can let you have. You know how they're
run after.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Montague had heard of the dinner, but had perhaps heard
as little of it as any man frequenting a club at the west end of
London. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not in the least want to be at the dinner, and
certainly did not wish to receive any extraordinary civility from
Mr. Melmotte's hands. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was very anxious to know why Mr.
Melmotte should offer it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) excused himself saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not
particularly fond of big dinners, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not like standing
in the way of other people. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``There are
ever so many people of title would give anything for a ticket. You'd
be astonished at the persons who have asked. We've had to squeeze in
a chair on one side for the Master of the Buckhounds, and on another
for the Bishop of--; I forget what bishop it is, but we had the two
archbishops before. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) must come because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) has something
to do with getting up the missionaries for Thibet. But I've got the
ticket, if you'll have it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>This was the ticket which was to have
taken in Georgiana Longestaffe as one of the Melmotte family, had not
Melmotte perceived that it might be useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as a bribe. But
Paul would not take the bribe. <div class="bookquote">``You're the only man in London then,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, somewhat offended. <div class="bookquote">``But at any rate you'll come in
the evening, and I'll have one of Madame Melmotte's tickets sent to
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul, not knowing how to escape, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would come in the
evening. <div class="bookquote">``I am particularly anxious,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to be civil to
those who are connected with our great Railway, and of course, in
this country, your name stands first,--next to my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the great man paused, and Paul began to wonder whether it could
be possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been sent for to Grosvenor Square on a Sunday
morning in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be asked to dine in the same house a
fortnight later. But that was impossible. <div class="bookquote">``Have you anything special
to say about the Railway?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes. It is so hard to get things said at the Board. Of course
there are some there who do not understand matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt if there be any one there who does understand this matter,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/>Melmotte affected to laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Well, well; I am not prepared to go
quite so far as that. My friend Cohenlupe has had great experience in
these affairs, and of course you are aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) is in Parliament.
And Lord Alfred sees farther into them than perhaps you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
credit for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) may easily do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well. Perhaps you don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) quite as well as I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>The
scowl began to appear on Mr. Melmotte's brow. Hitherto it had been
banished as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew how to banish it. <div class="bookquote">``What I wanted to say
to you was this. We didn't quite agree at the last meeting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; we did not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very sorry for it. Unanimity is everything in the direction of
such an undertaking as this. With unanimity we can do--everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Mr. Melmotte in the ecstasy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) enthusiasm lifted up both his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Without unanimity we can do--nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And
the two hands fell. <div class="bookquote">``Unanimity should be printed everywhere about a
Board-room. It should, indeed, Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose the directors are not unanimous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They should be unanimous. They should make themselves unanimous. God
bless my soul! You don't want to see the thing fall to pieces!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if it can be carried on honestly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Honestly! Who says that anything is dishonest?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Again the brow
became very heavy. <div class="bookquote">``Look here, Mr. Montague. If you and I quarrel
in that Board-room, there is no knowing the amount of evil we may
do to every individual shareholder in the Company. I find the
responsibility on my own shoulders so great that I say the thing must
be stopped. Damme, Mr. Montague, it must be stopped. We mustn't ruin
widows and children, Mr. Montague. We mustn't let those shares run
down 20 below par for a mere chimera. I've known a fine property
blasted, Mr. Montague, sent straight to the dogs,--annihilated,
sir;--so that it all vanished into thin air, and widows and children
past counting were sent out to starve about the streets,--just
because one director sat in another director's chair. I did, by
G--! What do you think of that, Mr. Montague? Gentlemen who don't
know the nature of credit, how strong it is,--as the air,--to buoy
you up; how slight it is,--as a mere vapour,--when roughly touched,
can do an amount of mischief of which they themselves don't in the
least understand the extent! What is it you want, Mr. Montague?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Melmotte's description of the peculiar
susceptibility of great mercantile speculations had not been given
without some effect on Montague, but this direct appeal to himself
almost drove that effect out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``I only want justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you should know what justice is before you demand it at the
expense of other people. Look here, Mr. Montague. I suppose you are
like the rest of us, in this matter. You want to make money out of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For myself, I want interest for my capital; that is all. But I am
not thinking of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are getting very good interest. If I understand the
matter,'' (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>--and here Melmotte pulled out a little book, showing thereby
how careful he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was in mastering details,--<div class="bookquote">``you had about #6,000
embarked in the business when Fisker joined your firm. You imagine
yourself to have that still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I've got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you then. You have that, and you've drawn nearly a
thousand pounds since Fisker came over, in one shape or another.
That's not bad interest on your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was back interest due to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, it's due still. I've nothing to do with that. Look here, Mr.
Montague. I am most anxious that you should remain with us. I was
about to propose, only for that little rumpus the other day, that,
as you're an unmarried man, and have time on your hands, you should
go out to California and probably across to Mexico, in order to get
necessary information for the Company. Were I of your age, unmarried,
and without impediment, it is just the thing I should like. Of course
you'd go at the Company's expense. I would see to your own personal
interests while you were away;--or you could appoint any one by power
of attorney. Your seat at the Board would be kept for you; but,
should anything occur amiss,--which it won't, for the thing is as
sound as anything I know,--of course you, as absent, would not
share the responsibility. That's what I was thinking. It would be a
delightful trip;--but if you don't like it, you can of course remain
at the Board, and be of the greatest use to me. Indeed, after a bit
I could devolve nearly the whole management on you;--and I must do
something of the kind, as I really haven't the time for it. But,--if
it is to be that way,--do be unanimous. Unanimity is the very soul of
these things;--the very soul, Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I can't be unanimous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--if you can't, and if you won't take my advice about going
out;--which, pray, think about, for you would be most useful. It
might be the very making of the railway;--then I can only suggest
that you should take your #6,000 and leave us. I, myself, should be
greatly distressed; but if you are determined that way I will see
that you have your money. I will make myself personally responsible
for the payment of it,--some time before the end of the year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul Montague told the great man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would consider the whole
matter, and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in Abchurch Lane before the next Board day. <div class="bookquote">``And
now, good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bade his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) young friend adieu
in a hurry. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid that I'm keeping Sir Gregory Gribe, the Bank
Director, waiting down-stairs.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLI.

<p/>ALL PREPARED.


<p/>During all these days Miss Melmotte was by no means contented with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lover's prowess, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would not allow herself to doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
sincerity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not only assured him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) undying affection in
the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father and mother, had not only offered to be
chopped in pieces on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) behalf, but had also written to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), telling
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had a large sum of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father's money within her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) power, and
how willing she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was to make it her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own, to throw over her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father and
mother, and give herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) fortune to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been very gracious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lover, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lover was a
little slow in acknowledging the favours conferred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). But,
nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lover, and believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was
true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Didon had been hitherto faithful. Marie had written
various letters to Sir Felix, and had received two or three very
short notes in reply, containing hardly more than a word or two each.
But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was told that a day was absolutely fixed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) marriage
with Lord Nidderdale, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) things were to be got ready.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was to be married in the middle of August, and here they were,
approaching the end of June. <div class="bookquote">``You may buy what you like, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``and if papa agrees about Felix, why then I suppose they'll do.
But they'll never be of any use about Lord Nidderdale. If you were to
sew me up in the things by main force, I wouldn't have him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Madame
Melmotte groaned, and scolded in English, French, and German, and
wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) were dead; she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) told Marie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was a pig, and
ass, and a toad, and a dog. And ended, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) always did end, by
swearing that Melmotte must manage the matter himself. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody shall
manage this matter for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. <div class="bookquote">``I know what I'm about now,
and I won't marry anybody just because it will suit papa.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Que
nous étions encore à Francfort, ou New York,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the elder lady,
remembering the humbler but less troubled times of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) earlier life.
Marie did not care for Francfort or New York; for Paris or for
London;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did care for Sir Felix Carbury.

<p/>While her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) father on Sunday morning was transacting business in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
own house with Paul Montague and the great commercial magnates of
the city,--though it may be doubted whether that very respectable
gentleman Sir Gregory Gribe was really in Grosvenor Square when his (<font color='blue'><b>Gribe</b></font>)
name was mentioned,--Marie was walking inside the gardens; Didon was
also there at some distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>); and Sir Felix Carbury was there
also close along side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). Marie had the key of the gardens for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own use; and had already learned that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) neighbours in the
square did not much frequent the place during church time on Sunday
morning. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover's letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father had of course been shown to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had taxed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with it immediately. Sir Felix, who had
thought much of the letter as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came from Welbeck Street to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
appointment,--having been assured by Didon that the gate should be
left unlocked, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would be there to close it after he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
come in,--was of course ready with a lie. <div class="bookquote">``It was the only thing to
do, Marie;--it was indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you said you had accepted some offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't suppose I wrote the letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was your handwriting, Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it was. I copied just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Que</b></font>) put down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Que</b></font>)'d have sent you
clean away where I couldn't have got near you if I hadn't written
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have accepted nothing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. As it is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Que</b></font>) owes me money. Is not that odd? I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Que</b></font>)
a thousand pounds to buy shares, and I haven't got anything from him (<font color='blue'><b>Que</b></font>)
yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix, no doubt, forgot the cheque for #200.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody ever does who gives papa money,''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div>said the observant daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't they? Dear me! But I just wrote it because I thought anything
better than a downright quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't have written it, if it had been ever so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good scolding, Marie. I did it for the best. What do you
think we'd best do now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), almost with scorn.
Surely it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to propose and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to yield. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder
whether you're sure you're right about that money which you say is
settled.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``It's no good scolding.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm quite sure. Mamma told me in Paris,--just when we were coming
away,--that it was done so that there might be something if things
went wrong. And papa told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should want me to sign something
from time to time; and of course I said I would. But of course I
won't,--if I should have a husband of my own.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Felix walked along,
pondering the matter, with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trowsers pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
entertained those very fears which had latterly fallen upon Lord
Nidderdale. There would be no <div class="bookquote">``cropper''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>which a man could <div class="bookquote">``come''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>so bad as would be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cropper were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to marry Marie Melmotte, and
then find that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not to have a shilling! And, were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now to
run off with Marie, after having written that letter, the father
would certainly not forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). This assurance of Marie's as to the
settled money was too doubtful! The game to be played was too full of
danger! And in that case he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would certainly get neither his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) #800, nor
the shares. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were true to Melmotte, Melmotte would probably
supply him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) with ready money. But then here was the girl at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) elbow,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) no more dared to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) meant to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) dared to tell Melmotte that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) intended to stick to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) engagement. Some half promise would be the only escape for the
present. <div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking of, Felix?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's d-- difficult to know what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do. If I didn't love you why should I be here walking
round this stupid place? They talk of your being married to
Nidderdale about the end of August.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some day in August. But that's all nonsense, you know. They can't
take me up and marry me, as they used to do the girls ever so long
ago. I won't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) don't care a bit for me, and never did.
I don't think you care much, Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. A fellow can't go on saying so over and over again in a
beastly place like this. If we were anywhere jolly together, then I
could say it often enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we were, Felix. I wonder whether we ever shall be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I hardly see my way as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not going to give it up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no;--not give it up; certainly not. But the bother is a fellow
doesn't know what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've heard of young Mr. Goldsheiner, haven't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>suggested

Switzerland, and now they've got a house close to Albert Gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How jolly for them! He (<font color='blue'><b>Albert</b></font>) is awfully rich, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Albert</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Start</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Start</b></font>)'d lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Start</b></font>) place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are plenty of places. She (<font color='blue'><b>Start</b></font>) could come and live with us, and

all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And would you come to Folkestone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that would be stupid, because Lady Julia did that. We should
make it a little different. If you liked I wouldn't mind going
to--New York. And then, perhaps, we might--get--married, you know, on

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And would Didon go too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) proposes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) could go as my aunt, and I'd call
myself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) name;--any French name you know. I should go as a
French girl. And you could call yourself Smith, and be an American.
We wouldn't go together, but we'd get on board just at the last
moment. If they wouldn't--marry us on board, they would at New York,
instantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Didon's plan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That's what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thinks best,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll do it, if you'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
#50 for herself, you know. The ``Adriatic,'--that'<div class="bookquote">'' a White Star boat,
goes on Thursday week at noon. There's an early train that would take
us down that morning. You had better go and sleep at Liverpool, and
take no notice of us at all till we meet on board. We could be back
in a month,--and then papa would be obliged to make the best of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix at once felt that it would be quite unnecessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to
go to Herr Vossner or to any other male counsellor for advice as to
the best means of carrying off his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) love. The young lady had it all
at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers' ends,--even to the amount of the fee required by the
female counsellor. But Thursday week was very near, and the whole
thing was taking uncomfortably defined proportions. Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to
get funds if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) were to resolve that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would do this thing? He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had
been fool enough to intrust his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) ready money to Melmotte, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
was told that when Melmotte got hold of ready money he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not apt to
release it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had nothing to show;--no security that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could
offer to Vossner. And then,--this idea of starting to New York with
Melmotte's daughter immediately after he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had written to Melmotte
renouncing the girl, frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix did not know these lines, but the lesson taught by them
came home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at this moment. Now was the tide in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) affairs at
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might make himself, or utterly mar himself. <div class="bookquote">``It's deuced
important,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said at last with a groan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not more important for you than me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you're wrong about the money, and he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) shouldn't come round, where
should we be then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing venture, nothing have,''  (<font color='red'><b>the heiress</b></font>)</div>said the heiress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very well; but one might venture everything and get
nothing after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd get me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie with a pout.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--and I'm awfully fond of you. Of course I should get you!
But--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well then;--if that's your love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, turning back from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/>Sir Felix gave a great sigh, and then announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) resolution. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
venture it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix, how grand it will be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a great deal to do, you know. I don't know whether it can be
Thursday week.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was putting in the coward's plea for a reprieve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be afraid of Didon if it's delayed long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's the money to get, and all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can get some money. Mamma has money in the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>asked the baronet eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred pounds, perhaps;--perhaps two hundred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would help certainly. I must go to your father for money. Won't
that be a sell? To get it from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), to take you away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was decided that they were to go to New York, on a Thursday,--on
Thursday week if possible, but as to that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) know in a
day or two. Didon was to pack up the clothes and get it sent out of
the house. Didon was to have #50 before she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) went on board; and as one
of the men must know about it, and must assist in having the trunks
smuggled out of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was to have #10. All had been settled
beforehand, so that Sir Felix really had no need to think about
anything. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, <div class="bookquote">``there's Didon. Nobody's looking
and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can open that gate for you. When we're gone, do you creep
out. The gate can be left, you know. Then we'll get out on the other
side.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie Melmotte was certainly a clever girl.




<p/>CHAPTER XLII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``CAN YOU BE READY IN TEN MINUTES?''


 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>After leaving Melmotte's house on Sunday morning Paul Montague went
to Roger Carbury's hotel and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend just returning from
church. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was bound to go to Islington on that day, but had made up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would defer his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) visit till the evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would
dine early and be with Mrs. Hurtle about seven o'clock. But it was
necessary that Roger should hear the news about Ruby Ruggles. <div class="bookquote">``It's
not so bad as you thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is living with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard of such an aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) grandfather knows where she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) doesn't
want her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) see Felix Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it doesn't matter whether the woman's her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) aunt or not. I'll go
and see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and try to get her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) back to Bungay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not send for John Crumb?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger hesitated for a moment, and then answered, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)'d give Felix
such a thrashing as no man ever had before. My cousin deserves it as
well as any man ever deserved a thrashing; but there are reasons why
I should not like it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not force her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) back with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I
don't suppose the girl is all bad,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s bad at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate I'll go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I shall see
your widow at the same time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul sighed, but said nothing more
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) widow at that moment. <div class="bookquote">``I'll walk up to Welbeck Street now,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I shall see you to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not go to Welbeck Street with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friend.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) dined in solitude at the Beargarden, and then again made that
journey to Islington in a cab. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thought of the proposal
that had been made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) by Melmotte. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could do it with a clear
conscience, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could really make himself believe in the railway,
such an expedition would not be displeasing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had said
already more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had intended to say to Hetta Carbury; and though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was by no means disposed to flatter himself, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) almost thought
that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had said had been well received. At the moment they had
been disturbed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) heard the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mother coming,
had at any rate expressed no anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had almost been betrayed into
breaking a promise. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to start now on this journey, the period
of the promise would have passed by before his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) return. Of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would take care that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had gone in the
performance of a duty. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would escape from Mrs. Hurtle,
and would be able to make those inquiries which had been suggested
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). It was possible that Mrs. Hurtle should offer to go with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--an arrangement which would not at all suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). That at any
rate must be avoided. But then how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) do this without a belief
in the railway generally? And how was it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should have
such belief? Mr. Ramsbottom did not believe in it, nor did Roger
Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) himself did not in the least believe in Fisker, and
Fisker had originated the railway. Then, would it not be best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
should take the Chairman's offer as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) own money? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) could get
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) #6,000 back and have done with the railway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) would certainly
think himself a lucky man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) did not know how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) could with
honesty lay aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) responsibility; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) doubted whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
could put implicit trust in Melmotte's personal guarantee for the
amount. This at any rate was clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>),--that Melmotte was very
anxious to secure his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) absence from the meetings of the Board.

<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was again at Mrs. Pipkin's door, and again it was opened
by Ruby Ruggles. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) heart was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mouth as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought of the
things he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had to say. <div class="bookquote">``The ladies have come back from Southend, Miss
Ruggles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, sir, and Mrs. Hurtle is expecting you all the day.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
put in a whisper on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) own account. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as you'd
seen me, Mr. Montague?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I did, Miss Ruggles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you might as well have left it alone, and not have been
ill-natured,--that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) opened the door of Mrs.
Hurtle's room.

<p/>Mrs. Hurtle got up to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) sweetest smile,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
smile could be very sweet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was a witch of a woman, and, as like
most witches she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could be terrible, so like most witches she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could
charm. <div class="bookquote">``Only fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that you should have come the only
day I have been two hundred yards from the house, except that evening
when you took me to the play. I was so sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you be sorry? It is easy to come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I don't like to miss you, even for a day. But I wasn't well,
and I fancied that the house was stuffy, and Mrs. Pipkin took a
bright idea and proposed to carry me off to Southend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was dying
to go herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) declared that Southend was Paradise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A cockney Paradise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a place it is! Do your people really go to Southend and
fancy that that is the sea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe they do. I never went to Southend myself,--so that you
know more about it than I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very English it is,--a little yellow river,--and you call it the
sea! Ah;--you never were at Newport!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I've been at San Francisco.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you've been at San Francisco, and heard the seals howling.
Well; that's better than Southend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we do have the sea here in England. It's generally
supposed we're an island.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course;--but things are so small. If you choose to go to the west
of Ireland, I suppose you'd find the Atlantic. But nobody ever does
go there for fear of being murdered.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul thought of the gentleman
in Oregon, but said nothing;--thought, perhaps, of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own condition,
and remembered that a man might be murdered without going either to
Oregon or the west of Ireland. <div class="bookquote">``But we went to Southend, I, and Mrs.
Pipkin and the baby, and upon my word I enjoyed it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was so afraid
that the baby would annoy me, and I thought the baby was so much the
best of it. And then we ate shrimps, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was so humble. You must
acknowledge that with us nobody would be so humble. Of course I paid.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) has got all her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) children, and nothing but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) can make out
of these lodgings. People are just as poor with us;--and other people
who happen to be a little better off, pay for them. But nobody is
humble to another, as you are here. Of course we like to have money
as well as you do, but it doesn't make so much difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) who wants to receive, all the world over, will make himself as

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mrs. Pipkin was so humble. However we got back all right
yesterday evening, and then I found that you had been here,--at
last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew that I had to go to Liverpool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to scold. Did you get your business done at
Liverpool?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--one generally gets something done, but never anything very
satisfactorily. Of course it's about this railway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought that that was satisfactory. Everybody talks
of it as being the greatest thing ever invented. I wish I was a man
that I might be concerned with a really great thing like that. I hate
little peddling things. I should like to manage the greatest bank
in the world, or to be Captain of the biggest fleet, or to make the
largest railway. It would be better even than being President of a
Republic, because one would have more of one's own way. What is it
that you do in it, Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They want me now to go out to Mexico about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), throwing herself forward and asking the
question with manifest anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? Do go. Oh, Paul, I would go with you. Why should you not
go? It is just the thing for such a one as you to do. The railway
will make Mexico a new country, and then you would be the man who had
done it. Why should you throw away such a chance as that? It will
never come again. Emperors and kings have tried their hands at Mexico
and have been able to do nothing. Emperors and kings never can do
anything. Think what it would be to be the regenerator of Mexico!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think what it would be to find one's self there without the means of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would make the means of doing something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Means are money. How can I make that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is money going. There must be money where there is all this
buying and selling of shares. Where does your uncle get the money
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is living like a prince at San Francisco? Where does
Fisker get the money with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) is speculating in New York? Where
does Melmotte get the money which makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) the richest man in the
world? Why should not you get it as well as the others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were anxious to rob on my own account perhaps I might do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should it be robbery? I do not want you to live in a palace
and spend millions of dollars on yourself. But I want you to have
ambition. Go to Mexico, and chance it. Take San Francisco in your

people there believe that you are in earnest, and there will be no
difficulty about the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was taking no steps to approach the subject which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
should have to discuss before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>),--or rather the statement
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make. Indeed every word which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to say respecting this Mexican project carried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
farther away from it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was giving reasons why the journey should
not be made; but was tacitly admitting that if it were to be made she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
might be one of the travellers. The very offer on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) part implied
an understanding that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) former abnegation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) engagement had
been withdrawn, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shrunk from the cruelty of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>),
in a side-way fashion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) companionship
either for the purpose of such a journey or for any other purpose.
The thing must be said in a solemn manner, and must be introduced on
its own basis. But such preliminary conversation as this made the
introduction of it infinitely more difficult.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not in a hurry?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going to spend the evening with me like a good man? Then I'll
ask them to let us have tea.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) rang the bell and Ruby came in, and
the tea was ordered. <div class="bookquote">``That young lady tells me that you are an old
friend of hers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've known about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) down in the country, and was astonished to find
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) here yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some lover, isn't there;--some would-be husband whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
does not like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And some won't-be husband, I fear, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's quite of course, if the other is true. Miss Ruby isn't
the girl to have come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) time of life without a preference.
The natural liking of a young woman for a man in a station above
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is softer and cleaner and has better parts of
speech,--just as we keep a pretty dog if we keep a dog at all,--is
one of the evils of the inequality of mankind. The girl is content
with the love without having the love justified, because the object
is more desirable. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can only have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) love justified with an
object less desirable. If all men wore coats of the same fabric, and
had to share the soil of the work of the world equally between them,
that evil would come to an end. A woman here and there might go wrong
from fantasy and diseased passions, but the ever-existing temptation
to go wrong would be at an end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If men were equal to-morrow and all wore the same coats, they would
wear different coats the next day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Slightly different. But there would be no more purple and fine
linen, and no more blue woad. It isn't to be done in a day of course,
nor yet in a century,--nor in a decade of centuries; but every human
being who looks into it honestly will see that his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) efforts should be
made in that direction. I remember; you never take sugar; give me
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come here to discuss the deeply interesting questions
of women's difficulties and immediate or progressive equality. But
having got on to these rocks,--having, as the reader may perceive,
been taken on to them wilfully by the skill of the woman,--he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) did not
know how to get his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) bark out again into clear waters. But having his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
own subject before him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), with all its dangers, the wild-cat's claws,
and the possible fate of the gentleman in Oregon, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not talk
freely on the subjects which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) introduced, as had been his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wont
in former years. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cup. <div class="bookquote">``How well you
remember!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I shall ever forget your preferences and dislikings? Do
you recollect telling me about that blue scarf of mine, that I should
never wear blue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stretched herself out towards him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), waiting for an answer,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was obliged to speak. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I do. Black is your
colour;--black and grey; or white,--and perhaps yellow when you
choose to be gorgeous; crimson possibly. But not blue or green.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought much of it before, but I have taken your word for
gospel. It is very good to have an eye for such things,--as you have,
Paul. But I fancy that taste comes with, or at any rate forbodes, an
effete civilisation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry that mine should be effete,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what I mean, Paul. I speak of nations, not individuals.
Civilisation was becoming effete, or at any rate men were, in
the time of the great painters; but Savanarola and Galileo were
individuals. You should throw your lot in with a new people. This
railway to Mexico gives you the chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are the Mexicans a new people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They who will rule the Mexicans are. All American women I dare say
have bad taste in gowns,--and so the vain ones and rich ones send to
Paris for their finery; but I think our taste in men is generally
good. We like our philosophers; we like our poets; we like our
genuine workmen;--but we love our heroes. I would have you a hero,
Paul.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chair and walked about the room in an
agony of despair. To be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was expected to be a hero
at the very moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) felt more devoid of
heroism, more thoroughly given up to cowardice than he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had ever been
before, was not to be endured! And yet, with what utmost stretch of
courage,--even though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were willing to devote himself certainly and
instantly to the worst fate that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had pictured to himself,--could
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) immediately rush away from these abstract speculations, encumbered
as they were with personal flattery, into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own most unpleasant,
most tragic matter! It was the unfitness that deterred him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and
not the possible tragedy. Nevertheless, through it all, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
sure,--nearly sure,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was playing her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) game, and playing it
in direct antagonism to the game which she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wanted to
play. Would it not be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should go away and write another
letter? In a letter he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could at any rate say what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had to say;--and
having said it he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would then strengthen himself to adhere to it.
<div class="bookquote">``What makes you so uneasy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked; still speaking in her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) most
winning way, caressing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with the tones of her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Do you not
like me to say that I would have you be a hero?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Winifrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I came here with a purpose, and I had better
carry it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What purpose?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) still leaned forward, but now supported her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face
on her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) two hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) elbows resting on her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knees, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
intently. But one would have said that there was only love in her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
eyes;--love which might be disappointed, but still love. The wild
cat, if there, was all within, still hidden from sight. Paul stood
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands on the back of a chair, propping himself up and trying
to find fitting words for the occasion. <div class="bookquote">``Stop, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Must the purpose be told to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul, I am not well;--I am weak now. I am a coward. You do not know
the delight to me of having a few words of pleasant talk to an old
friend after the desolation of the last weeks. Mrs. Pipkin is not
very charming. Even her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) baby cannot supply all the social wants of my
life. I had intended that everything should be sweet to-night. Oh,
Paul, if it was your purpose to tell me of your love, to assure me
that you are still my dear, dear friend, to speak with hope of future
days, or with pleasure of those that are past,--then carry out your
purpose. But if it be cruel, or harsh, or painful; if you had come to
speak daggers;--then drop your purpose for to-night. Try and think
what my solitude must have been to me, and let me have one hour of
comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was conquered for that night, and could only have that
solace which a most injurious reprieve could give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I will not
harass you, if you are ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ill. It was because I was afraid that I should be really ill
that I went to Southend. The weather is hot, though of course the sun
here is not as we have it. But the air is heavy,--what Mrs. Pipkin
calls muggy. I was thinking if I were to go somewhere for a week, it
would do me good. Where had I better go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul suggested Brighton.
<div class="bookquote">``That is full of people; is it not?--a fashionable place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at this time of the year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is a big place. I want some little place that would be
pretty. You could take me down; could you not? Not very far, you
know;--not that any place can be very far from here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul, in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
John Bull displeasure, suggested Penzance, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), untruly, that
it would take twenty-four hours. <div class="bookquote">``Not Penzance then, which I know is
your very Ultima Thule;--not Penzance, nor yet Orkney. Is there no
other place,--except Southend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is Cromer in Norfolk,--perhaps ten hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Cromer by the sea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--what we call the sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean really the sea, Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you start from Cromer right away, a hundred miles would perhaps
take you across to Holland. A ditch of that kind wouldn't do
perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,--now I see you are laughing at me. Is Cromer pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes;--I think it is. I was there once, but I don't remember
much. There's Ramsgate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Pipkin told me of Ramsgate. I don't think I should like
Ramsgate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's the Isle of Wight. The Isle of Wight is very pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the Queen's place. There would not be room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) and me
too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or Lowestoft. Lowestoft is not so far as Cromer, and there is a
railway all the distance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And sea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sea enough for anything. If you can't see across it, and if there
are waves, and wind enough to knock you down, and shipwrecks every
other day, I don't see why a hundred miles isn't as good as a
thousand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred miles is just as good as a thousand. But, Paul, at
Southend it isn't a hundred miles across to the other side of the
river. You must admit that. But you will be a better guide than Mrs.
Pipkin. You would not have taken me to Southend when I expressed a
wish for the ocean;--would you? Let it be Lowestoft. Is there an
hotel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A small little place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very small? uncomfortably small? But almost any place would do for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They make up, I believe, about a hundred beds; but in the States it
would be very small.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), delighted to have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back to this humour,
<div class="bookquote">``if I were to throw the tea things at you, it would serve you right.
This is all because I did not lose myself in awe at the sight of the
Southend ocean. It shall be Lowestoft.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rose up and came to
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``You will take me down, will you not? It is
desolate for a woman to go into such a place all alone. I will not
ask you to stay. And I can return by myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had put both hands
on one arm, and turned herself round, and looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``You
will do that for old acquaintance sake?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For a moment or two he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) made
no answer, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face was troubled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brow was black. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
endeavouring to think;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was only aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) danger, and
could see no way through it. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you will let me ask in
vain for such a favour as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I will take you down. When will you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
cockered himself up with some vain idea that the railway carriage
would be a good place for the declaration of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) purpose, or perhaps
the sands at Lowestoft.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When will I go? when will you take me? You have Boards to attend,
and shares to look to, and Mexico to regenerate. I am a poor woman
with nothing on hand but Mrs. Pipkin's baby. Can you be ready in ten
minutes?--because I could.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul shook his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head and laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I've
named a time and that doesn't suit. Now, sir, you name another, and
I'll promise it shall suit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul suggested Saturday, the 29th. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
must attend the next Board, and had promised to see Melmotte before
the Board day. Saturday of course would do for Mrs. Hurtle. Should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at the railway station? Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) undertook to come
and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>).

<p/>Then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) leave, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) stood close against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
cheek up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to kiss. There are moments in which a man finds it
utterly impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be prudent,--as to which, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of them afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could never forgive himself for
prudence, let the danger have been what it may. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) lips as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) cheeks.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIII.

<p/>THE CITY ROAD.


<p/>The statement made by Ruby as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) connection with Mrs. Pipkin was
quite true. Ruby's father had married a Pipkin whose brother had died
leaving a widow behind him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at Islington. The old man at Sheep's Acre
farm had greatly resented this marriage, had never spoken to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
daughter-in-law,--or to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son after the marriage, and had steeled
himself against the whole Pipkin race. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) undertook the charge
of Ruby he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made it matter of agreement that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) should have
no intercourse with the Pipkins. This agreement Ruby had broken,
corresponding on the sly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) uncle's widow at Islington. When
therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) ran away from Suffolk she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could
with herself in going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) aunt's house. Mrs. Pipkin was a poor
woman, and could not offer a permanent home to Ruby; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was
good-natured, and came to terms. Ruby was to be allowed to stay at
any rate for a month, and was to work in the house for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) bread. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) made it a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) bargain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) should be allowed to go
out occasionally. Mrs. Pipkin immediately asked after a lover. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby. If the lover was what he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) ought to be, had he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
not better come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)? This was Mrs. Pipkin's suggestion. Mrs.
Pipkin thought that scandal might in this way be avoided. <div class="bookquote">``That's as
it may be, by-and-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) told all the story of John
Crumb:--how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) hated John Crumb; how resolved she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was that nothing
should make her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) marry John Crumb. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own account of
that night on which John Crumb and Mr. Mixet ate their supper at the
farm, and of the manner in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) grandfather had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) would not have John Crumb. Mrs. Pipkin was a respectable
woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) way, always preferring respectable lodgers if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) could
get them;--but bound to live. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) gave Ruby very good advice. Of
course if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``dead-set''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>against John Crumb, that was one thing!
But then there was nothing a young woman should look to so much as
a decent house over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head,--and victuals. <div class="bookquote">``What's all the love
in the world, Ruby, if a man can't do for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>Ruby declared that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) knew somebody who could do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>), and could do very well for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was about, and wasn't going to be put off
it. Mrs. Pipkin's morals were good wearing morals, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was not
strait-laced. If Ruby chose to manage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own way about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) must. Mrs. Pipkin had an idea that young women in these days did
have, and would have, and must have more liberty than was allowed
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was young. The world was being changed very fast. Mrs.
Pipkin knew that as well as others. And therefore when Ruby went to
the theatre once and again,--by herself as far as Mrs. Pipkin knew,
but probably in company with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) lover,--and did not get home till
past midnight, Mrs. Pipkin said very little about it, attributing
such novel circumstances to the altered condition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) country.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had not been allowed to go to the theatre with a young man when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had been a girl,--but that had been in the earlier days of Queen
Victoria, fifteen years ago, before the new dispensation had come.
Ruby had never yet told the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover to Mrs. Pipkin, having
answered all inquiries by saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was all right. Sir Felix's
name had never even been mentioned in Islington till Paul Montague
had mentioned it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had been managing her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own affairs after her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
own fashion,--not altogether with satisfaction, but still without
interruption; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) knew that interference would come. Mr.
Montague had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) out, and had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) grandfather's landlord.
The Squire would be after her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), and then John Crumb would come,
accompanied of course by Mr. Mixet,--and after that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) said to
herself on retiring to the couch which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) shared with two little
Pipkins, <div class="bookquote">``the fat would be in the fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pipkins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who do you think was at our place yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby one evening
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover. They were sitting together at a music-hall,--half
music-hall, half theatre, which pleasantly combined the allurements
of the gin-palace, the theatre, and the ball-room, trenching hard on
those of other places. Sir Felix was smoking, dressed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) himself
called it, <div class="bookquote">``incognito,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with a Tom-and-Jerry hat, and a blue silk
cravat, and a green coat. Ruby thought it was charming. Felix
entertained an idea that were his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) West End friends to see him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in this
attire they would not know him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was smoking, and had before him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) a
glass of hot brandy and water, which was common to himself and Ruby.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was enjoying life. Poor Ruby! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was half-ashamed of herself,
half-frightened, and yet supported by a feeling that it was a grand
thing to have got rid of restraints, and be able to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) young
man. Why not? The Miss Longestaffes were allowed to sit and dance and
walk about with their young men,--when they had any. Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) to
be given up to a great mass of stupid dust like John Crumb, without
seeing anything of the world? But yet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) sat sipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) lover's
brandy and water between eleven and twelve at the music-hall in
the City Road, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was not altogether comfortable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) saw things
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) did not like to see. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) heard things which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) did
not like to hear. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) lover, though he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was beautiful,--oh, so
beautiful!--was not all that a lover should be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was still a
little afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), and did not dare as yet to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) for the
promise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to make to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) mind was set
upon--marriage, but the word had hardly passed between them. To have
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) waist was heaven to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)! Could it be possible that
he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) and John Crumb were of the same order of human beings? But how was
this to go on? Even Mrs. Pipkin made disagreeable allusions, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
could not live always with Mrs. Pipkin, coming out at nights to drink
brandy and water and hear music with Sir Felix Carbury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was glad
therefore to take the first opportunity of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lover that
something was going to happen. <div class="bookquote">``Who do you suppose was at our place
yesterday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix changed colour, thinking of Marie Melmotte, thinking that
perhaps some emissary from Marie Melmotte had been there; perhaps
Didon herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was amusing himself during these last evenings of
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in London; but the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) life was about to take him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
to New York. That project was still being elaborated. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had had an
interview with Didon, and nothing was wanting but the money. Didon
had heard of the funds which had been intrusted by him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to Melmotte,
and had been very urgent with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to recover them. Therefore, though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) body was not unfrequently present, late in the night, at the City
Road Music-Hall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind was ever in Grosvenor Square. <div class="bookquote">``Who was it,
Ruby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A friend of the Squire's, a Mr. Montague. I used to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) about in

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)'s right too. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) knows there's somebody. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) ain't

has to mind herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)'s ever so fond of a young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix sucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cigar and then took a long drink of brandy and
water. Having emptied the beaker before him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) rapped for the waiter
and called for another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) intended to avoid the necessity of making
any direct reply to Ruby's importunities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was going to New York
very shortly, and looked on his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) journey thither as an horizon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
future beyond which it was unnecessary to speculate as to any farther
distance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not troubled himself to think how it might be with
Ruby when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not even considered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would or
would not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was going, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) started. It was not
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) fault that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had come up to London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was an <div class="bookquote">``awfully jolly
girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) liked the feeling of the intrigue better perhaps than
the girl herself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) assured himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wasn't going to give
himself any <div class="bookquote">``d--d trouble.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The idea of John Crumb coming up to
London in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wrath had never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),--or he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would probably
have hurried on his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) journey to New York instead of delaying it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was doing now. <div class="bookquote">``Let's go in and have a dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/>Ruby was very fond of dancing,--perhaps liked it better than anything
in the world. It was heaven to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) to be spinning round the big room
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover's arm tight round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) waist, with one hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) other hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) loved the music, and loved the
motion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) ear was good, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) strength was great, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) never
lacked breath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could spin along and dance a whole room down, and
feel at the time that the world could have nothing to give better
worth having than that;--and such moments were too precious to be
lost. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) went and danced, resolving as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would
have some answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) question before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover on that
night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``You'll see me as far as the
Angel, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was ready to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) as far as the
Angel. <div class="bookquote">``What am I to say to the Squire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what am I to say to aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)? Just say what you have said all along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've said nothing all along,--just to oblige you, Felix. I must say
something. A girl has got herself to mind. What have you got to say
to me, Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was silent for about a minute, meditating his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) answer. <div class="bookquote">``If you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cut it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--cut it. Can't you wait till I am ready to say something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Waiting will be the ruin o' me, if I wait much longer. Where am I to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You find a place! No; that won't do. I've told you all that before.
I'd sooner go into service, or--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go back to John Crumb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John Crumb has more respect for me nor you. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'d make me his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) wife
to-morrow, and only be too happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't tell you to come away from him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did. You told me as I was to come up to London when I saw
you at Sheepstone Beeches;--didn't you? And you told me you loved
me;--didn't you? And that if I wanted anything you'd get it done for
me;--didn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I will. What do you want? I can give you a couple of sovereigns,
if that's what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No it isn't;--and I won't have your money. I'd sooner work my
fingers off. I want you to say whether you mean to marry me. There!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>As to the additional lie which Sir Felix might now have told, that
would have been nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was going to New York, and would
be out of the way of any trouble; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) thought that lies of that
kind to young women never went for anything. Young women, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) thought,
didn't believe them, but liked to be able to believe afterwards
that they had been deceived. It wasn't the lie that stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
throat, but the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was a baronet. It was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) estimation
<div class="bookquote">``confounded impudence''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>on the part of Ruby Ruggles to ask to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) did not care for the lie, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) did not like to seem to
lower himself by telling such a lie as that at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dictation. <div class="bookquote">``Marry,
Ruby! No, I don't ever mean to marry. It's the greatest bore out. I
know a trick worth two of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stopped in the street and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). This was a state of
things of which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had never dreamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could imagine that a
man should wish to put it off, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have the face to
declare to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young woman that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never meant to marry at all, was a
thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not understand. What business had such a man to
go after any young woman? <div class="bookquote">``And what do you mean that I'm to do, Sir
Felix?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just go easy, and not make yourself a bother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not make myself a bother! Oh, but I will; I will. I'm to be carrying
on with you, and nothing to come of it; but for you to tell me that
you don't mean to marry, never at all! Never?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you see lots of old bachelors about, Ruby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I does. There's the Squire. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) don't come asking girls
to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's more than you know, Ruby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)'d marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) out of hand,--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)'s a gentleman.
That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is, every inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) never said a word to a
girl,--not to do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) any harm, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>and Ruby began to cry. <div class="bookquote">``You
mustn't come no further now, and I'll never see you again--never!
I think you're the falsest young man, and the basest, and the
lowest-minded that I ever heard tell of. I know there are them as
don't keep their words. Things turn up, and they can't. Or they gets
to like others better; or there ain't nothing to live on. But for a
young man to come after a young woman, and then say, right out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
never means to marry at all, is the lowest-spirited fellow that ever
was. I never read of such a one in none of the books. No, I won't.
You go your way, and I'll go mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passion she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was as good
as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) word, and escaped from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), running all the way to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt's
door. There was in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind a feeling of anger against the man, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not herself understand, in that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would incur no risk on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
behalf. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not even make a lover's easy promise, in order that
the present hour might be made pleasant. Ruby let herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
aunt's house, and cried herself to sleep with a child on each side of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>).

<p/>On the next day Roger called. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had begged Mrs. Pipkin to attend
the door, and had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) to declare, should any gentleman ask for
Ruby Ruggles, that Ruby Ruggles was out. Mrs. Pipkin had not refused
to do so; but, having heard sufficient of Roger Carbury to imagine
the cause which might possibly bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to the house, and having
made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) mind that Ruby's present condition of independence was
equally unfavourable to the lodging-house and to Ruby herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
determined that the Squire, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did come, should see the young
lady. When therefore Ruby was called into the little back parlour and
found Roger Carbury there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had been caught in a
trap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had been very cross all the morning. Though in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) rage she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
had been able on the previous evening to dismiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) titled lover,
and to imply that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) never meant to see him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) again, now, when the
remembrance of the loss came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) amidst her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) daily work,--when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could no longer console herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) drudgery by thinking of
the beautiful things that were in store for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>), and by flattering
herself that though at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was little better than a maid
of all work in a lodging-house, the time was soon coming in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would bloom forth as a baronet's bride,--now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) solitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
almost regretted the precipitancy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own conduct. Could it be
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would never see him (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) again;--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would dance no more
in that gilded bright saloon? And might it not be possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
had pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) too hard? A baronet of course would not like to be
brought to book, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could bring to book such a one as John Crumb.
But yet,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) should have said never;--that he (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) would never marry!
Looking at it in any light, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was very unhappy, and this coming of
the Squire did not serve to cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) misery.

<p/>Roger was very kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>), taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) by the hand, and bidding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) sit down, and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) how glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was
comfortably settled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) aunt. <div class="bookquote">``We were all alarmed, of course,
when you went away without telling anybody where you were going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandfather 'd been that cruel to me that I couldn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>).''

have treated me like that. No girl 'd like to be pulled about the
room by the hairs of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) things all off, just
getting into bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The Squire had no answer to make to this. That old Ruggles should be
a violent brute under the influence of gin and water did not surprise
him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). And the girl, when driven away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home by such usage, had
not done amiss in coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt. But Roger had already heard
a few words from Mrs. Pipkin as to Ruby's late hours, had heard
also that there was a lover, and knew very well who that lover was.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) also was quite familiar with John Crumb's state of mind. John
Crumb was a gallant, loving fellow who might be induced to forgive
everything, if Ruby would only go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); but would certainly
persevere, after some slow fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own, and <div class="bookquote">``see the matter
out,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would say himself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did not go back. <div class="bookquote">``As you found
yourself obliged to run away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad that you should
be here; but you don't mean to stay here always?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must think of your future life. You don't want to be always your
aunt's maid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be very odd if you did, when you may be the wife of such a
man as Mr. Crumb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Crumb! Everybody is going on about Mr. Crumb. I don't like
Mr. Crumb, and I never will like him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look here, Ruby; I have come to speak to you very seriously, and
I expect you to hear me. Nobody can make you marry Mr. Crumb, unless
you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody can't, of course, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I fear you have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) up for somebody else, who certainly
won't marry you, and who can only mean to ruin you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody won't ruin me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby. <div class="bookquote">``A girl has to look to herself,
and I mean to look to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to hear you say so, but being out at night with such a one
as Sir Felix Carbury is not looking to yourself. That means going to
the devil head foremost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ain't a going to the devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby, sobbing and blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will, if you put yourself into the hands of that young man.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s as bad as bad can be. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s my own cousin, and yet I'm obliged
to tell you so. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no more idea of marrying you than I have; but
were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to marry you, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not support you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is ruined himself,
and would ruin any young woman who trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I'm almost old enough
to be your father, and in all my experience I never came across so
vile a young man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would ruin you and cast you from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
without a pang of remorse. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no heart in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom;--none.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>Ruby
had now given way altogether, and was sobbing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) apron to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
eyes in one corner of the room. <div class="bookquote">``That's what Sir Felix Carbury is,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, standing up so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) might speak with the more
energy, and talk her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) down more thoroughly. <div class="bookquote">``And if I understand it
rightly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``it is for a vile thing such as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that you
have left a man who is as much above him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in character, as the sun is
above the earth. You think little of John Crumb because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not
wear a fine coat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care about any man's coat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>said Ruby; <div class="bookquote">``but John hasn't ever
a word to say, was it ever so.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``I don't care about any man's coat.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Words to say! what do words matter? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves you after
that fashion that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants to make you happy and respectable, not to
make you a bye-word and a disgrace.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>Ruby struggled hard to make some
opposition to the suggestion, but found herself to be incapable of
speech at the moment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks more of you than of himself, and
would give you all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has. What would that other man give you?

by the hairs of your head? Would there be any want then, or any
disgrace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't no disgrace, Mr. Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No disgrace in going about at midnight with such a one as Felix
Carbury? You are not a fool, and you know that it is disgraceful. If
you are not unfit to be an honest man's wife, go back and beg that
man's pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John Crumb's pardon! No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Ruby, if you knew how highly I respect that man, and how lowly
I think of the other; how I look on the one as a noble fellow, and
regard the other as dust beneath my feet, you would perhaps change
your mind a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) mind was being changed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) words did have their effect, though
the poor girl struggled against the conviction that was borne in upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never expected to hear any one call John Crumb noble.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had never respected any one more highly than Squire Carbury,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said that John Crumb was noble. Amidst all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) misery and
trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) still told herself that it was but a dusty, mealy,--and
also a dumb nobility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what will take place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>continued Roger. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Crumb

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) can't do nothing to me, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true enough. Unless it be to take you in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) arms and press
you to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) wants to do nothing to you. Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)'d
injure you if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) could? You don't know what a man's love really
means, Ruby. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do something to somebody else. How do you
think it would be with Felix Carbury, if they two were in a room
together and nobody else by?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John's mortial strong, Mr. Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If two men have equal pluck, strength isn't much needed. One is a
brave man, and the other--a coward. Which do you think is which?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s your own cousin, and I don't know why you should say everything

beg his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never will;--never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've spoken to Mrs. Pipkin, and while you're here she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) will see that
you don't keep such hours any longer. You tell me that you're not

like that! I've said what I've got to say, and I'm going away. But
I'll let your grandfather know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandfather don't want me no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll come again. If you want money to go home, I will let you

impress her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) with admiration for John Crumb, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had certainly been
efficacious in lessening that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had entertained for Sir
Felix.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIV.

<p/>THE COMING ELECTION.


<p/>The very greatness of Mr. Melmotte's popularity, the extent of
the admiration which was accorded by the public at large to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
commercial enterprise and financial sagacity, created a peculiar
bitterness in the opposition that was organised against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at
Westminster. As the high mountains are intersected by deep valleys,
as puritanism in one age begets infidelity in the next, as in many
countries the thickness of the winter's ice will be in proportion
to the number of the summer musquitoes, so was the keenness of the
hostility displayed on this occasion in proportion to the warmth of
the support which was manifested. As the great man was praised, so
also was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) abused. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a demi-god to some, so was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a fiend
to others. And indeed there was hardly any other way in which it
was possible to carry on the contest against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). From the moment
in which Mr. Melmotte had declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) purpose of standing for
Westminster in the Conservative interest, an attempt was made to
drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) down the throats of the electors by clamorous assertions of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) unprecedented commercial greatness. It seemed that there was but
one virtue in the world, commercial enterprise,--and that Melmotte
was its prophet. It seemed, too, that the orators and writers of the
day intended all Westminster to believe that Melmotte treated his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
great affairs in a spirit very different from that which animates the
bosoms of merchants in general. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had risen above any feeling of
personal profit. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wealth was so immense that there was no longer
place for anxiety on that score. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) already possessed,--so it was
said,--enough to found a dozen families, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had but one daughter!
But by carrying on the enormous affairs which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be able to open up new worlds, to afford relief to the
oppressed nationalities of the over-populated old countries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
seen how small was the good done by the Peabodys and the Bairds, and,
resolving to lend no ear to charities and religions, was intent on
projects for enabling young nations to earn plentiful bread by the
moderate sweat of their brows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was the head and front of the
railway which was to regenerate Mexico. It was presumed that the
contemplated line from ocean to ocean across British America would
become a fact in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) who was to enter into terms
with the Emperor of China for farming the tea-fields of that vast
country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) was already in treaty with Russia for a railway from
Moscow to Khiva. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had a fleet,--or soon would have a fleet of
emigrant ships,--ready to carry every discontented Irishman out of
Ireland to whatever quarter of the globe the Milesian might choose
for the exercise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) political principles. It was known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>)
had already floated a company for laying down a submarine wire from
Penzance to Point de Galle, round the Cape of Good Hope,--so that,
in the event of general wars, England need be dependent on no other
country for its communications with India. And then there was the
philanthropic scheme for buying the liberty of the Arabian fellahs
from the Khedive of Egypt for thirty millions sterling,--the
compensation to consist of the concession of a territory about four
times as big as Great Britain in the lately annexed country on the
great African lakes. It may have been the case that some of these
things were as yet only matters of conversation,--speculations as to
which Mr. Melmotte's mind and imagination had been at work, rather
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pocket or even his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) credit; but they were all sufficiently
matured to find their way into the public press, and to be used as
strong arguments why Melmotte should become member of Parliament for
Westminster.

<p/>All this praise was of course gall to those who found themselves
called upon by the demands of their political position to oppose Mr.
Melmotte. You can run down a demi-god only by making him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) out to be a
demi-devil. These very persons, the leading Liberals of the leading
borough in England as they called themselves, would perhaps have
cared little about Melmotte's antecedents had it not become their
duty to fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as a Conservative. Had the great man found at the
last moment that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own British politics had been liberal in their
nature, these very enemies would have been on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) committee. It was
their business to secure the seat. And as Melmotte's supporters began
the battle with an attempt at what the Liberals called <div class="bookquote">``bounce,'' (<font color='red'><b>the Liberals</b></font>)</div>--to
carry the borough with a rush by an overwhelming assertion of
their candidate's virtues,--the other party was driven to make
some enquiries as to that candidate's antecedents. They quickly
warmed to the work, and were not less loud in exposing the Satan
of speculation, than had been the Conservatives in declaring the
commercial Jove. Emissaries were sent to Paris and Francfort, and
the wires were used to Vienna and New York. It was not difficult
to collect stories,--true or false; and some quiet men, who merely
looked on at the game, expressed an opinion that Melmotte might have
wisely abstained from the glories of Parliament.

<p/>Nevertheless there was at first some difficulty in finding a proper
Liberal candidate to run against him (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>). The nobleman who had been
elevated out of his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) seat by the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) father had been a great
Whig magnate, whose family was possessed of immense wealth and
of popularity equal to its possessions. One of that family might
have contested the borough at a much less expense than any other
person,--and to them the expense would have mattered but little.
But there was no such member of it forthcoming. Lord This and Lord
That,--and the Honourable This and the Honourable That, sons of other
cognate Lords,--already had seats which they were unwilling to vacate
in the present state of affairs. There was but one other session for
the existing Parliament; and the odds were held to be very greatly in
Melmotte's favour. Many an outsider was tried, but the outsiders were
either afraid of Melmotte's purse or his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) influence. Lord Buntingford
was asked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buntingford</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buntingford</b></font>) family were good old Whigs. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Buntingford</b></font>) was
nephew to Lord Alfred Grendall, first cousin to Miles Grendall, and
abstained on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) relatives. An overture was made to Sir
Damask Monogram, who certainly could afford the contest. But Sir
Damask did not see his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) way. Melmotte was a working bee, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
a drone,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not wish to have the difference pointed out by
Mr. Melmotte's supporters. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) yacht and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
four-in-hand.

<p/>At last a candidate was selected, whose nomination and whose consent
to occupy the position created very great surprise in the London
world. The press had of course taken up the matter very strongly. The
<div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>supported Mr. Melmotte with all its weight.
There were people who said that this support was given by Mr. Broune
under the influence of Lady Carbury, and that Lady Carbury in this
way endeavoured to reconcile the great man to a marriage between
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter and Sir Felix. But it is more probable that Mr. Broune
saw,--or thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) saw,--which way the wind sat, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
supported the commercial hero because he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) felt that the hero would be
supported by the country at large. In praising a book, or putting
foremost the merits of some official or military claimant, or writing
up a charity,--in some small matter of merely personal interest,--the
Editor of the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>the Editor</b></font>)</div>might perhaps allow himself
to listen to a lady whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) loved. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) work too well to
jeopardize his (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) paper by such influences in any matter which might
probably become interesting to the world of his (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) readers. There was
a strong belief in Melmotte. The clubs thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) would be
returned for Westminster. The dukes and duchesses fêted him (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>). The
city,--even the city was showing a wavering disposition to come
round. Bishops begged for his (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) name on the list of promoters of their
pet schemes. Royalty without stint was to dine at his (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) table. Melmotte
himself was to sit at the right hand of the brother of the Sun and
of the uncle of the Moon, and British Royalty was to be arranged
opposite, so that every one might seem to have the place of most
honour. How could a conscientious Editor of a <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast
Table,''  (<font color='red'><b>a Editor</b></font>)</div>seeing how things were going, do other than support Mr.
Melmotte? In fair justice it may be well doubted whether Lady Carbury
had exercised any influence in the matter.

<p/>But the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>took the other side. Now this was the
more remarkable, the more sure to attract attention, inasmuch as
the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had never supported the Liberal interest.
As was said in the first chapter of this work, the motto of that
newspaper implied that it was to be conducted on principles of
absolute independence. Had the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>contemporaries</b></font>)</div>like some of its
contemporaries, lived by declaring from day to day that all Liberal
elements were godlike, and all their opposites satanic, as a matter
of course the same line of argument would have prevailed as to the
Westminster election. But as it had not been so, the vigour of the
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>on this occasion was the more alarming and the
more noticeable,--so that the short articles which appeared almost
daily in reference to Mr. Melmotte were read by everybody. Now they
who are concerned in the manufacture of newspapers are well aware
that censure is infinitely more attractive than eulogy,--but they
are quite as well aware that it is more dangerous. No proprietor
or editor was ever brought before the courts at the cost of ever
so many hundred pounds,--which if things go badly may rise to
thousands,--because he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had attributed all but divinity to some very
poor specimen of mortality. No man was ever called upon for damages
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had attributed grand motives. It might be well for
politics and literature and art,--and for truth in general, if it
was possible to do so. But a new law of libel must be enacted before
such salutary proceedings can take place. Censure on the other hand
is open to very grave perils. Let the Editor have been ever so
conscientious, ever so beneficent,--even ever so true,--let it be
ever so clear that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) has written has been written on behalf
of virtue, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) has misstated no fact, exaggerated no fault,
never for a moment been allured from public to private matters,--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) may still be in danger of ruin. A very long purse, or else a
very high courage is needed for the exposure of such conduct as the
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>attributed to Mr. Melmotte. The paper took up this
line suddenly. After the second article Mr. Alf sent back to Mr.
Miles Grendall, who in the matter was acting as Mr. Melmotte's
secretary, the ticket of invitation for the dinner, with a note from
Mr. Alf stating that circumstances connected with the forthcoming
election for Westminster could not permit him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) to have the great
honour of dining at Mr. Melmotte's table in the presence of the
Emperor of China. Miles Grendall showed the note to the dinner
committee, and, without consultation with Mr. Melmotte, it
was decided that the ticket should be sent to the Editor of a
thorough-going Conservative journal. This conduct on the part of the
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>astonished the world considerably; but the world was
more astonished when it was declared that Mr. Ferdinand Alf himself
was going to stand for Westminster on the Liberal interest.

<p/>Various suggestions were made. Some said that as Mr. Alf had a large
share in the newspaper, and as its success was now an established
fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) himself intended to retire from the laborious position which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) filled, and was therefore free to go into Parliament. Others were
of opinion that this was the beginning of a new era in literature,
of a new order of things, and that from this time forward editors
would frequently be found in Parliament, if editors were employed of
sufficient influence in the world to find constituencies. Mr. Broune
whispered confidentially to Lady Carbury that the man was a fool for
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pains, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was carried away by pride. <div class="bookquote">``Very clever,--and
dashing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never had ballast.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not want to give up Mr. Alf if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could help
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) had never said a civil word of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) paper;--but still
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had an idea that it was well to be on good terms with so great a
power. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) entertained a mysterious awe for Mr. Alf,--much in excess
of any similar feeling excited by Mr. Broune, in regard to whom
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) awe had been much diminished since he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) an offer of
marriage. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sympathies as to the election of course were with Mr.
Melmotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thoroughly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) still thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
nod might be the means of making Felix,--or if not his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) nod, then his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
money without the nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is very rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said, speaking to Mr. Broune
respecting Mr. Alf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has put by something. But this election will cost him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
#10,000;--and if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) goes on as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is doing now, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had better allow
another #10,000 for action for libel. They've already declared that
they will indict the paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe about the Austrian Insurance Company?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>This was a
matter as to which Mr. Melmotte was supposed to have retired from
Paris not with clean hands.

<p/>``I don't believe the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit' can prove it,--and I'm sure
that they can't attempt to prove it without an expense of three or
four thousand pounds. That's a game in which nobody wins but the
lawyers. I wonder at Alf. I should have thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) would have
known how to get all said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) wanted to have said without running
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) head into the lion's mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) has been so clever up to
this! God knows he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has been bitter enough, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has always sailed
within the wind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Alf had a powerful committee. By this time an animus in regard to
the election had been created strong enough to bring out the men on
both sides, and to produce heat, when otherwise there might only have
been a warmth or possibly frigidity. The Whig Marquises and the Whig
Barons came forward, and with them the liberal professional men,
and the tradesmen who had found that party to answer best, and the
democratical mechanics. If Melmotte's money did not, at last, utterly
demoralise the lower class of voters, there would still be a good
fight. And there was a strong hope that, under the ballot, Melmotte's
money might be taken without a corresponding effect upon the voting.
It was found upon trial that Mr. Alf was a good speaker. And though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) still conducted the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) made time for addressing
meetings of the constituency almost daily. And in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) speeches he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
never spared Melmotte. No one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, had a greater reverence for
mercantile grandeur than himself. But let them take care that the
grandeur was grand. How great would be the disgrace to such a borough
as that of Westminster if it should find that it had been taken in
by a false spirit of speculation and that it had surrendered itself
to gambling when it had thought to do honour to honest commerce.
This, connected as of course it was, with the articles in the paper,
was regarded as very open speaking. And it had its effect. Some men
began to say that Melmotte had not been known long enough to deserve
confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) riches, and the Lord Mayor was already beginning to
think that it might be wise to escape the dinner by some excuse.

<p/>Melmotte's committee was also very grand. If Alf was supported by
Marquises and Barons, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) was supported by Dukes and Earls. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
speaking in public did not of itself inspire much confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
had very little to say when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) attempted to explain the political
principles on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) intended to act. After a little he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) confined
himself to remarks on the personal attacks made on him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) by the other
side, and even in doing that was reiterative rather than diffusive.
Let them prove it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) defied them to prove it. Englishmen were too
great, too generous, too honest, too noble,--the men of Westminster
especially were a great deal too high-minded to pay any attention to
such charges as these till they were proved. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) began again. Let
them prove it. Such accusations as these were mere lies till they
were proved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) did not say much himself in public as to actions
for libel,--but assurances were made on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) behalf to the electors,
especially by Lord Alfred Grendall and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) son, that as soon as the
election was over all speakers and writers would be indicted for
libel, who should be declared by proper legal advice to have made
themselves liable to such action. The <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Alf
would of course be the first victims.

<p/>The dinner was fixed for Monday, July the 8th. The election for the
borough was to be held on Tuesday the 9th. It was generally thought
that the proximity of the two days had been arranged with the view of
enhancing Melmotte's expected triumph. But such in truth was not the
case. It had been an accident, and an accident that was distressing
to some of the Melmottites. There was much to be done about the
dinner,--which could not be omitted; and much also as to the
election,--which was imperative. The two Grendalls, father and son,
found themselves to be so driven that the world seemed for them to be
turned topsey-turvey. The elder had in old days been accustomed to
electioneering in the interest of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own family, and had declared
himself willing to make himself useful on behalf of Mr. Melmotte. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found Westminster to be almost too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was called
here and sent there, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was very near rebellion. <div class="bookquote">``If this goes
on much longer I shall cut it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of me, governor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son. <div class="bookquote">``I have to be in the city four
or five times a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've a regular salary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, governor; you've done pretty well for that. What's my salary
to the shares you've had? The thing is;--will it last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are a good many who say that Melmotte will burst up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Lord Alfred. <div class="bookquote">``They don't know what they're
talking about. There are too many in the same boat to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) burst
up. It would be the bursting up of half London. But I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
after this that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must make it easier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wants to know who's to
have every ticket for the dinner, and there's nobody to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
except me. And I've got to arrange all the places, and nobody to help
me except that fellow from the Herald's office. I don't know about
people's rank. Which ought to come first: a director of the bank or
a fellow who writes books?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>Miles suggested that the fellow from the
Herald's office would know all about that, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) father need
not trouble himself with petty details.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you shall come to us for three days,--after it's over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said
Lady Monogram to Miss Longestaffe; a proposition to which Miss
Longestaffe acceded, willingly indeed, but not by any means as
though a favour had been conferred upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>). Now the reason why Lady
Monogram had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) mind as to inviting her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) old friend, and thus
threw open her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) hospitality for three whole days to the poor young
lady who had disgraced herself by staying with the Melmottes, was as
follows. Miss Longestaffe had the disposal of two evening tickets for
Madame Melmotte's grand reception; and so greatly had the Melmottes
risen in general appreciation, that Lady Monogram had found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>)
was bound, on behalf of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) own position in society, to be present
on that occasion. It would not do that her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) name should not be in the
printed list of the guests. Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had made a serviceable
bargain with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) old friend Miss Longestaffe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) two
tickets for the reception, and Miss Longestaffe was to be received
for three days as a guest by Lady Monogram. It had also been conceded
that at any rate on one of these nights Lady Monogram should take
Miss Longestaffe out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) should herself receive
company on another. There was perhaps something slightly painful at
the commencement of the negotiation; but such feelings soon fade
away, and Lady Monogram was quite a woman of the world.




<p/>CHAPTER XLV.

<p/>MR. MELMOTTE IS PRESSED FOR TIME.


<p/>About this time, a fortnight or nearly so before the election, Mr.
Longestaffe came up to town and saw Mr. Melmotte very frequently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
could not go into his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own house, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had let that for a month to
the great financier, nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) any establishment in town; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
slept at an hotel and lived at the Carlton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was quite delighted to
find that his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) new friend was an honest Conservative, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) himself
proposed the honest Conservative at the club. There was some idea of
electing Mr. Melmotte out of hand, but it was decided that the club
could not go beyond its rule, and could only admit Mr. Melmotte
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) regular turn as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should occupy a seat in the
House of Commons. Mr. Melmotte, who was becoming somewhat arrogant,
was heard to declare that if the club did not take him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
willing to be taken, it might do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). If not elected at once,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) name. So great was his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) prestige at this moment
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own party that there were some, Mr. Longestaffe among the
number, who pressed the thing on the committee. Mr. Melmotte was not
like other men. It was a great thing to have Mr. Melmotte in the
party. Mr. Melmotte's financial capabilities would in themselves be
a tower of strength. Rules were not made to control the club in a
matter of such importance as this. A noble lord, one among seven who
had been named as a fit leader of the Upper House on the Conservative
side in the next session, was asked to take the matter up; and men
thought that the thing might have been done had he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) complied. But he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>)
was old-fashioned, perhaps pig-headed; and the club for the time lost
the honour of entertaining Mr. Melmotte.

<p/>It may be remembered that Mr. Longestaffe had been anxious to become
one of the directors of the Mexican Railway, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was rather
snubbed than encouraged when he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) wish to Mr. Melmotte.
Like other great men, Mr. Melmotte liked to choose his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own time for
bestowing favours. Since that request was made the proper time had
come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had now intimated to Mr. Longestaffe that in a somewhat
altered condition of things there would be a place for him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) at the
Board, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) brother directors would be delighted to
avail themselves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) assistance. The alliance between Mr. Melmotte
and Mr. Longestaffe had become very close. The Melmottes had visited
the Longestaffes at Caversham. Georgiana Longestaffe was staying
with Madame Melmotte in London. The Melmottes were living in Mr.
Longestaffe's town house, having taken it for a month at a very
high rent. Mr. Longestaffe now had a seat at Mr. Melmotte's board.
And Mr. Melmotte had bought Mr. Longestaffe's estate at Pickering
on terms very favourable to the Longestaffes. It had been suggested
to Mr. Longestaffe by Mr. Melmotte that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had better qualify for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) seat at the Board by taking shares in the Company to the amount
of--perhaps two or three thousand pounds, and Mr. Longestaffe had
of course consented. There would be no need of any transaction in
absolute cash. The shares could of course be paid for out of Mr.
Longestaffe's half of the purchase money for Pickering Park, and
could remain for the present in Mr. Melmotte's hands. To this also
Mr. Longestaffe had consented, not quite understanding why the scrip
should not be made over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) at once.

<p/>It was a part of the charm of all dealings with this great man that
no ready money seemed ever to be necessary for anything. Great
purchases were made and great transactions apparently completed
without the signing even of a cheque. Mr. Longestaffe found himself
to be afraid even to give a hint to Mr. Melmotte about ready money.
In speaking of all such matters Melmotte seemed to imply that
everything necessary had been done, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had said that it was
done. Pickering had been purchased and the title-deeds made over
to Mr. Melmotte; but the #80,000 had not been paid,--had not been
absolutely paid, though of course Mr. Melmotte's note assenting
to the terms was security sufficient for any reasonable man. The
property had been mortgaged, though not heavily, and Mr. Melmotte
had no doubt satisfied the mortgagee; but there was still a sum of
#50,000 to come, of which Dolly was to have one half and the other
was to be employed in paying off Mr. Longestaffe's debts to tradesmen
and debts to the bank. It would have been very pleasant to have had
this at once,--but Mr. Longestaffe felt the absurdity of pressing
such a man as Mr. Melmotte, and was partly conscious of the gradual
consummation of a new æra in money matters. <div class="bookquote">``If your banker is
pressing you, refer him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Mr. Melmotte had said. As for many
years past we have exchanged paper instead of actual money for our
commodities, so now it seemed that, under the new Melmotte régime, an
exchange of words was to suffice.

<p/>But Dolly wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) money. Dolly, idle as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was, foolish as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was,
dissipated as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was and generally indifferent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) debts, liked to
have what belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). It had all been arranged. #5,000 would pay
off all his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) tradesmen's debts and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) comfortably possessed of
money in hand, while the other #20,000 would make his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own property
free. There was a charm in this which awakened even Dolly, and for
the time almost reconciled him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father's society. But now a
shade of impatience was coming over him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had actually gone down
to Caversham to arrange the terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father,--and had in fact
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own terms. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father had been unable to move him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and
had consequently suffered much in spirit. Dolly had been almost
triumphant,--thinking that the money would come on the next day, or
at any rate during the next week. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father early in
the morning,--at about two o'clock,--to enquire what was being done.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not as yet been made blessed with a single ten-pound note in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand, as the result of the sale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to see Melmotte, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) asked somewhat abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I'm to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to-morrow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is to introduce me to the
Board.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going in for that, are you, sir? Do they pay anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nidderdale and young Carbury belong to it. It's a sort of Beargarden
affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A bear-garden affair, Adolphus. How so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean the club. We had them all there for dinner one day, and a
jolly dinner we gave them. Miles Grendall and old Alfred belong to
it. I don't think they'd go in for it, if there was no money going.
I'd make them fork out something if I took the trouble of going all
that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that perhaps, Adolphus, you hardly understand these things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. I don't understand much about business, I know. What I
want to understand is, when Melmotte is going to pay up this money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'ll arrange it with the banks,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) won't arrange my money with the banks, sir. You'd
better tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) not. A cheque upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bank which I can pay in to
mine is about the best thing going. You'll be in the city to-morrow,
and you'd better tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). If you don't like, you know, I'll get
Squercum to do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>Mr. Squercum was a lawyer whom Dolly had employed
of late years much to the annoyance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) parent. Mr. Squercum's
name was odious to Mr. Longestaffe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you'll do nothing of the kind. It will be very foolish if you
do;--perhaps ruinous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'d better pay up, like anybody else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) left
the room. The father knew the son, and was quite sure that Squercum
would have his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) finger in the pie unless the money were paid quickly.
When Dolly had taken an idea into his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) head, no power on earth,--no
power at least of which the father could avail himself,--would turn
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>On that same day Melmotte received two visits in the city from two
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) fellow directors. At the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was very busy. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
electioneering speeches were neither long nor pithy, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had to
think of them beforehand. Members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) Committee were always trying
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Orders as to the dinner and the preparation of the house
could not be given by Lord Alfred without some reference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>).
And then those gigantic commercial affairs which were enumerated in
the last chapter could not be adjusted without much labour on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
part. His (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) hands were not empty, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) saw each of these young
men,--for a few minutes. <div class="bookquote">``My dear young friend, what can I do for
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) said to Sir Felix, not sitting down, so that Sir Felix also
should remain standing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About that money, Mr. Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What money, my dear fellow? You see that a good many money matters
pass through my hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The thousand pounds I gave you for shares. If you don't mind, and as
the shares seem to be a bother, I'll take the money back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only the other day you had #200,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, showing that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could apply his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) memory to small transactions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly;--and you might as well let me have the #800.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've ordered the shares;--gave the order to my broker the other
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'd better take the shares,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, feeling that it
might very probably be that day fortnight before he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could start for
New York. <div class="bookquote">``Could I get them, Mr. Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, I really think you hardly calculate the value of my
time when you come to me about such an affair as this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd like to have the money or the shares,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, who was
not specially averse to quarrelling with Mr. Melmotte now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had resolved upon taking that gentleman's daughter to New York in
direct opposition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) written promise. Their quarrel would be so
thoroughly internecine when the departure should be discovered, that
any present anger could hardly increase its bitterness. What Felix
thought of now was simply his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) money, and the best means of getting it
out of Melmotte's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a spendthrift,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, apparently relenting, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm
afraid a gambler. I suppose I must give you #200 more on account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix could not resist the touch of ready money, and consented to
take the sum offered. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pocketed the cheque he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) asked for the name
of the brokers who were employed to buy the shares. But here Melmotte
demurred. <div class="bookquote">``No, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte; <div class="bookquote">``you are only entitled to
shares for #600 pounds now. I will see that the thing is put right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>So Sir Felix departed with #200 only. Marie had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could
get #200. Perhaps if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bestirred himself and wrote to some of
Miles's big relations he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) could obtain payment of a part of that
gentleman's debt to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>).

<p/>Sir Felix going down the stairs in Abchurch Lane met Paul Montague
coming up. Carbury, on the spur of the moment, thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) would
<div class="bookquote">``take a rise''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) called it out of Montague. <div class="bookquote">``What's this I hear
about a lady at Islington?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has told you anything about a lady at Islington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little bird. There are always little birds about telling of
ladies. I'm told that I'm to congratulate you on your coming
marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you've been told an infernal falsehood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Montague passing
on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) paused a moment and added, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know who can have told
you, but if you hear it again, I'll trouble you to contradict it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was waiting in Melmotte's outer room while the Duke's nephew
went in to see whether it was the great man's pleasure to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
remembered whence Carbury must have heard tidings of Mrs. Hurtle. Of
course the rumour had come through Ruby Ruggles.

<p/>Miles Grendall brought out word that the great man would see Mr.
Montague; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) added a caution. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s awfully full of work just
now,--you won't forget that;--will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Montague assured the duke's
nephew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would be concise, and was shown in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have troubled you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul, <div class="bookquote">``only that I understood
that I was to see you before the Board met.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly;--of course. It was quite necessary,--only you see I am a
little busy. If this d--d dinner were over I shouldn't mind. It's
a deal easier to make a treaty with an Emperor, than to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) a
dinner; I can tell you that. Well;--let me see. Oh;--I was proposing
that you should go out to Pekin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Mexico.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes;--to Mexico. I've so many things running in my head!
Well;--if you'll say when you're ready to start, we'll draw up
something of instructions. You'd know better, however, than we can
tell you what to do. You'll see Fisker, of course. You and Fisker
will manage it. The chief thing will be a cheque for the expenses;
eh? We must get that passed at the next Board.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Melmotte had been so quick that Montague had been unable to
interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``There need be no trouble about that, Mr. Melmotte, as
I have made up my mind that it would not be fit that I should go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>There had been a shade of doubt on Montague's mind, till the tone
in which Melmotte had spoken of the embassy grated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ears. The
reference to the expenses disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) altogether. <div class="bookquote">``No;--even did
I see my way to do any good in America my duties here would not be
compatible with the undertaking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that at all. What duties have you got here? What
good are you doing the Company? If you do stay, I hope you'll be
unanimous; that's all;--or perhaps you intend to go out. If that's
it, I'll look to your money. I think I told you that before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, Mr. Melmotte, is what I should prefer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,--very well. I'll arrange it. Sorry to lose you,--that's
all. Miles, isn't Mr. Goldsheiner waiting to see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a little too quick, Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man with my business on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands is bound to be quick, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must be precise. I cannot tell you as a fact that I shall
withdraw from the Board till I receive the advice of a friend with
whom I am consulting. I hardly yet know what my duty may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you, sir, what can not be your duty. It cannot be your
duty to make known out of that Board-room any of the affairs of the
Company which you have learned in that Board-room. It cannot be your
duty to divulge the circumstances of the Company or any differences
which may exist between Directors of the Company, to any gentleman
who is a stranger to the Company. It cannot be your duty--.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Melmotte. On matters such as that I think that I
can see my own way. I have been in fault in coming in to the Board
without understanding what duties I should have to perform--.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much in fault, I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>replied Melmotte, whose arrogance
in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) inflated glory was overcoming him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But in reference to what I may or may not say to any friend, or how
far I should be restricted by the scruples of a gentleman, I do not
want advice from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well;--very well. I can't ask you to stay, because a partner
from the house of Todd, Brehgert, and Goldsheiner is waiting to
see me, about matters which are rather more important than this of
yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Montague had said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had to say, and departed.

<p/>On the following day, three-quarters of an hour before the meeting of
the Board of Directors, old Mr. Longestaffe called in Abchurch Lane.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was received very civilly by Miles Grendall, and asked to sit
down. Mr. Melmotte quite expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and would walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) over
to the offices of the railway, and introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to the Board. Mr.
Longestaffe, with some shyness, intimated his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) desire to have a few
moments conversation with the chairman before the Board met. Fearing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son, especially fearing Squercum, he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mind to
suggest that the little matter about Pickering Park should be
settled. Miles assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) that the opportunity should be given him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>),
but that at the present moment the chief secretary of the Russian
Legation was with Mr. Melmotte. Either the chief secretary was very
tedious with his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) business, or else other big men must have come in,
for Mr. Longestaffe was not relieved till he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was summoned to walk off
to the Board five minutes after the hour at which the Board should
have met. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) could explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) views in the street;
but on the stairs they were joined by Mr. Cohenlupe, and in three
minutes they were in the Board-room. Mr. Longestaffe was then
presented, and took the chair opposite to Miles Grendall. Montague
was not there, but had sent a letter to the secretary explaining that
for reasons with which the chairman was acquainted he (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) should absent
himself from the present meeting. <div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``I know
all about it. Go on. I'm not sure but that Mr. Montague's retirement
from among us may be an advantage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could not be made to understand
that unanimity in such an enterprise as this is essential. I am
confident that the new director whom I have had the pleasure of
introducing to you to-day will not sin in the same direction.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Then
Mr. Melmotte bowed and smiled very sweetly on Mr. Longestaffe.

<p/>Mr. Longestaffe was astonished to find how soon the business was
done, and how very little he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been called on to do. Miles Grendall
had read something out of a book which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had been unable to follow.
Then the chairman had read some figures. Mr. Cohenlupe had declared
that their prosperity was unprecedented;--and the Board was over.
When Mr. Longestaffe explained to Miles Grendall that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) still wished
to speak to Mr. Melmotte, Miles explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) that the chairman
had been obliged to run off to a meeting of gentlemen connected with
the interior of Africa, which was now being held at the Cannon Street
Hotel.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVI.

<p/>ROGER CARBURY AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>CARBURY</b></font>) TWO FRIENDS.


<p/>Roger Carbury having found Ruby Ruggles, and having ascertained that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) was at any rate living in a respectable house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) aunt,
returned to Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had given the girl his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) advice, and had done
so in a manner that was not altogether ineffectual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had frightened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>), and had also frightened Mrs. Pipkin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had taught Mrs. Pipkin
to believe that the new dispensation was not yet so completely
established as to clear her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) from all responsibility as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) niece's
conduct. Having done so much, and feeling that there was no more to
be done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) returned home. It was out of the question that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should
take Ruby with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). In the first place she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would not have gone. And
then,--had she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) gone,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would not have known where to bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>).
For it was now understood throughout Bungay,--and the news had spread
to Beccles,--that old Farmer Ruggles had sworn that his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) granddaughter
should never again be received at Sheep's Acre Farm. The squire on
his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) return home heard all the news from his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own housekeeper. John
Crumb had been at the farm and there had been a fierce quarrel
between him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) and the old man. The old man had called Ruby by every
name that is most distasteful to a woman, and John had stormed and
had sworn that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have punched the old man's head but for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
age. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't believe any harm of Ruby,--or if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
ready to forgive that harm. But as for the Baro-nite;--the Baro-nite
had better look to himself! Old Ruggles had declared that Ruby
should never have a shilling of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money;--whereupon Crumb had
anathematised old Ruggles and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money too, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
an old hunx, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had driven the girl away by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cruelty.
Roger at once sent over to Bungay for the dealer in meal, who was
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) early on the following morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did ye find her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), squoire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Mr. Crumb, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s living with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) aunt, Mrs.
Pipkin, at Islington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, now;--look at that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had an aunt of that name up in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es; I knew'd it, squoire. I a' heard tell of Mrs. Pipkin, but I
never see'd her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder it did not occur to you that Ruby would go there.''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>John
Crumb scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head, as though acknowledging the shortcoming of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own intellect. <div class="bookquote">``Of course if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was to go to London it was the
proper thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'d do the thing as was right. I said that all along.
Darned if I didn't. You ask Mixet, squoire,--him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) as is baker down
Bardsey Lane. I allays guv' it her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'d do the thing as was
right. But how about she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) and the Baro-nite?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger did not wish to speak of the Baronet just at present. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose the old man down here did ill use her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dreadful;--there ain't no manner of doubt o' that. Dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
about awful;--as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be took up, only for the rumpus like.
D'ye think she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'s see'd the Baro-nite since she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'s been in Lon`on,
Muster Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'s a good girl, if you mean that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) be. I don't want none to tell me that, squoire. Tho',
squoire, it's better to me nor a ten pun' note to hear you say so. I
allays had a leaning to you, squoire; but I'll more nor lean to you,
now. I've said all through she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was good, and if e'er a man in Bungay
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) warn't--; well, I was there, and ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope nobody has said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't stop them women, squoire. There ain't no dropping into
them. But, Lord love `ee, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) shall come and be missus of my house
to-morrow, and what 'll it matter her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) then what they say? But,
squoire,--did ye hear if the Baro-nite had been a' hanging about that
place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Islington, you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) goes a hanging about; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) don't come out straight forrard,
and tell a girl as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) afore all the parish. There ain't
one in Bungay, nor yet in Mettingham, nor yet in all the Ilketsals
and all the Elmhams, as don't know as I'm set on Ruby Ruggles.
Huggery-Muggery is pi`son to me, squoire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We all know that when you've made up your mind, you have made up
your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hove. It's made up ever so as to Ruby. What sort of a one is her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
aunt now, squoire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) keeps lodgings;--a very decent sort of a woman I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) won't let the Baro-nite come there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, who felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was hardly dealing
sincerely with this most sincere of mealmen. Hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had shuffled
off every question that had been asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) about Felix, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
knew that Ruby had spent many hours with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) fashionable lover. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs.
Pipkin won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) come there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I was to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) a ge'own now,--or a blue cloak;--them
lodging-house women is mostly hard put to it;--or a chest of drawers
like, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) best bedroom, wouldn't that make her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) more o' my side,
squoire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'ll try to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) duty without that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do like things the like o' that; any ways I'll go up, squoire,
arter Sax`nam market, and see how things is lying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't go just yet, Mr. Crumb, if I were you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) hasn't
forgotten the scene at the farm yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said nothing as warn't as kind as kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) own perversity runs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) own head. If you had been unkind
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) could have forgiven that; but as you were good-natured and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
was cross, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) can't forgive that.''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>John Crumb again scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
head, and felt that the depths of a woman's character required more
gauging than he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had yet given to it. <div class="bookquote">``And to tell you the truth, my
friend, I think that a little hardship up at Mrs. Pipkin's will do
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) have a bellyful o' vittels?''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>asked John Crumb, with
intense anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite mean that. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) has enough to eat. But of
course she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) has to work for it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) aunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) has three or four
children to look after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That moight come in handy by-and-by;--moightn't it, squoire?''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said
John Crumb grinning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As you say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'ll be learning something that may be useful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
in another sphere. Of course there is a good deal to do, and I should
not be surprised if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) were to think after a bit that your house in
Bungay was more comfortable than Mrs. Pipkin's kitchen in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My little back parlour;--eh, squoire! And I've got a four-poster,
most as big as any in Bungay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you have everything comfortable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) knows it
herself. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) think about all that,--and do you go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
again in a month's time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'ll be more willing to settle matters
then than she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) is now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,--the Baro-nite!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Pipkin will allow nothing of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Girls is so `cute. Ruby is awful `cute. It makes me feel as though
I had two hun`erd weight o' meal on my stomach, lying awake o' nights
and thinking as how he (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) is, may be,--pulling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) about! If I
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'d let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)--; oh! I'd swing for it, Muster Carbury.
They'd have to make an eend o' me at Bury, if it was that way. They
would then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) again and again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) believed Ruby to be a good
girl, and promised that further steps should be taken to induce
Mrs. Pipkin to keep a close watch upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) niece. John Crumb made
no promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would abstain from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) journey to London after
Saxmundham fair; but left the squire with a conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
purpose of doing so was shaken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was still however resolved to send
Mrs. Pipkin the price of a new blue cloak, and declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) purpose
of getting Mixet to write the letter and enclose the money order.
John Crumb had no delicacy as to declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own deficiency in
literary acquirements. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was able to make out a bill for meal or
pollards, but did little beyond that in the way of writing letters.

<p/>This happened on a Saturday morning, and on that afternoon Roger
Carbury rode over to Lowestoft, to a meeting there on church matters
at which his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend the bishop presided. After the meeting was over
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) dined at the inn with half a dozen clergymen and two or three
neighbouring gentlemen, and then walked down by himself on to the
long strand which has made Lowestoft what it is. It was now just the
end of June, and the weather was delightful;--but people were not
as yet flocking to the sea-shore. Every shopkeeper in every little
town through the country now follows the fashion set by Parliament
and abstains from his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) annual holiday till August or September. The
place therefore was by no means full. Here and there a few of the
townspeople, who at a bathing place are generally indifferent to the
sea, were strolling about; and another few, indifferent to fashion,
had come out from the lodging-houses and from the hotel, which had
been described as being small and insignificant,--and making up only
a hundred beds. Roger Carbury, whose house was not many miles distant
from Lowestoft, was fond of the sea-shore, and always came to loiter
there for a while when any cause brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) into the town. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was walking close down upon the marge of the tide,--so that the last
little roll of the rising water should touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) feet,--with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
hands joined behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) back, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) face turned down towards the
shore, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) came upon a couple who were standing with their backs
to the land, looking forth together upon the waves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was close
to them before he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) saw them, and before they had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
perceived that the man was his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend Paul Montague. Leaning on
Paul's arm a lady stood, dressed very simply in black, with a dark
straw hat on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head;--very simple in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attire, but yet a woman
whom it would be impossible to pass without notice. The lady of
course was Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/>Paul Montague had been a fool to suggest Lowestoft, but his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) folly had
been natural. It was not the first place he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had named; but when fault
had been found with others, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had fallen back upon the sea sands
which were best known to himself. Lowestoft was just the spot which
Mrs. Hurtle required. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had been shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) room, and taken
down out of the hotel on to the strand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had declared herself to
be charmed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) acknowledged with many smiles that of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
had no right to expect that Mrs. Pipkin should understand what sort
of place she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) needed. But Paul would understand,--and had understood.
<div class="bookquote">``I think the hotel charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you
mean by your fun about the American hotels, but I think this quite
gorgeous, and the people so civil!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hotel people</b></font>)</div>Hotel people always are civil
before the crowds come. Of course it was impossible that Paul should
return to London by the mail train which started about an hour after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) arrival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would have reached London at four or five in the
morning, and have been very uncomfortable. The following day was
Sunday, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) promised to stay till Monday. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
had said nothing in the train of those stern things which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
resolved to say. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was not saying them when Roger Carbury
came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>); but was indulging in some poetical nonsense, some
probably very trite raptures as to the expanse of the ocean, and the
endless ripples which connected shore with shore. Mrs. Hurtle, too,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) leaned with friendly weight upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) arm, indulged also in
moonshine and romance. Though at the back of the heart of each of
them there was a devouring care, still they enjoyed the hour. We
know that the man who is to be hung likes to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breakfast well
cooked. And so did Paul like the companionship of Mrs. Hurtle because
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) attire, though simple, was becoming; because the colour glowed in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) dark face; because of the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) eyes, and the happy
sharpness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) words, and the dangerous smile which played upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) close vicinity, and the softness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) arm, and the perfume from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hair,--though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have given
all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had been removed from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by some
impassable gulf. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to be hanged,--and this woman's continued
presence would be as bad as death to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meal
well dressed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly had been foolish to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to Lowestoft, and the
close neighbourhood of Carbury Manor;--and now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) folly. As
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw Roger Carbury he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blushed up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, and then
leaving Mrs. Hurtle's arm he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came forward, and shook hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
friend. <div class="bookquote">``It is Mrs. Hurtle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I must introduce you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the
introduction was made. Roger took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hat and bowed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did
so with the coldest ceremony. Mrs. Hurtle, who was quick enough at
gathering the minds of people from their looks, was just as cold in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) acknowledgment of the courtesy. In former days she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had heard much
of Roger Carbury, and surmised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was no friend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I did
not know that you were thinking of coming to Lowestoft,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger
in a voice that was needlessly severe. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind at the present
moment was severe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of it. Mrs. Hurtle wished to get to the sea, and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) knew no one else here in England, I brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Montague and I have travelled so many miles together before
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that a few additional will not make much
difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you stay long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Roger in the same voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I go back probably on Monday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Montague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I shall be here a whole week, and shall not speak a word to any
one after he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has left me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has consented to bestow his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) company
on me for two days. Will you join us at dinner, Mr. Carbury, this
evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, madam;--I have dined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Mr. Montague, I will leave you with your friend. My toilet,
though it will be very slight, will take longer than yours. We dine
you know in twenty minutes. I wish you could get your friend to join
us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>So saying, Mrs. Hurtle tripped back across the sand towards the
hotel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this wise?''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>demanded Roger in a voice that was almost sepulchral,
as soon as the lady was out of hearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well ask that, Carbury. Nobody knows the folly of it so
thoroughly as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you do it? Do you mean to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it honest then, or like a gentleman, that you should be with her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
in this way? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) think that you intend to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) that I would not. I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)--.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
stopped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was going on to declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
loved another woman, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could hardly touch that
matter in speaking to Roger Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) mean then? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) no regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) own character?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would explain it to you all, Carbury, if I could. But you would
never have the patience to hear me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not naturally impatient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this would drive you mad. I wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that it
must be all over. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) came here and sent for me. Was I not bound
to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and repeat what you had said in your letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did do so. I went with that very purpose, and did repeat it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you should have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah; but you do not understand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) begged that I would not desert
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) loneliness. We have been so much together that I could not
desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly do not understand that, Paul. You have allowed yourself
to be entrapped into a promise of marriage; and then, for reasons
which we will not go into now but which we both thought to be
adequate, you resolved to break your promise, thinking that you would
be justified in doing so. But nothing can justify you in living with
the lady afterwards on such terms as to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to suppose that
your old promise holds good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does not think so. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cannot think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what must she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) be, to be here with you? And what must you be,

should trouble you or myself about it. People live now in a way that
I don't comprehend. If this be your way of living, I have no right to
complain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For God's sake, Carbury, do not speak in that way. It sounds as
though you meant to throw me over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have said that you had thrown me over. You come down here
to this hotel, where we are both known, with this lady whom you are
not going to marry;--and I meet you, just by chance. Had I known it,
of course I could have turned the other way. But coming on you by
accident, as I did, how am I not to speak to you? And if I speak,
what am I to say? Of course I think that the lady will succeed in
marrying you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that such a marriage will be your destruction. Doubtless she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and clever. And you must remember that the manners of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then if I marry at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) prejudice

she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) comes down here and stays with you. Paul, I don't believe it.
I believe you, but I don't believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is here with you in
order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) may marry you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is cunning and strong. You are
foolish and weak. Believing as I do that marriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would
be destruction, I should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) my mind,--and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Paul
at the moment thought of the gentleman in Oregon, and of certain
difficulties in leaving. <div class="bookquote">``That's what I should do. You must go in
now, I suppose, and eat your dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may come to the hall as I go back home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly you may come if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) bethought
himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) welcome had not been cordial. <div class="bookquote">``I mean that I shall
be delighted to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) added, marching away along the strand.
Paul did go into the hotel, and did eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) dinner. In the meantime
Roger Carbury marched far away along the strand. In all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
said to Montague he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had spoken the truth, or that which appeared to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to be the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not been influenced for a moment by any
reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own affairs. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) feared, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) almost knew, that
this man,--who had promised to marry a strange American woman and who
was at this very moment living in close intercourse with the woman
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) promise,--was the
chief barrier between himself and the girl that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) loved. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had listened to John Crumb while John spoke of Ruby Ruggles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and John Crumb were alike. With an honest,
true, heart-felt desire they both panted for the companionship of a
fellow-creature whom each had chosen. And each was to be thwarted
by the make-believe regard of unworthy youth and fatuous good looks!
Crumb, by dogged perseverance and indifference to many things, would
probably be successful at last. But what chance was there of success
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)? Ruby, as soon as want or hardship told upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>), would
return to the strong arm that could be trusted to provide her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) with
plenty and comparative ease. But Hetta Carbury, if once her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) heart
had passed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own dominion into the possession of another,
would never change her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) love. It was possible, no doubt,--nay, how
probable,--that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) heart was still vacillating. Roger thought that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knew that at any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had not as yet declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) love. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
were now to know,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could now learn,--of what nature was the
love of this other man; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could be instructed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was living
alone with a lady whom not long since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had promised to marry,--if
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could be made to understand this whole story of Mrs. Hurtle,
would not that open her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) eyes? Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) not then see where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
could trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) happiness, and where, by so trusting it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would
certainly be shipwrecked!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger to himself, hitting at the stones on the beach
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) stick. <div class="bookquote">``Never.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) horse and rode back to
Carbury Manor.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVII.

<p/>MRS. HURTLE AT LOWESTOFT.


<p/>When Paul got down into the dining-room Mrs. Hurtle was already
there, and the waiter was standing by the side of the table ready to
take the cover off the soup. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was radiant with smiles and made
herself especially pleasant during dinner, but Paul felt sure that
everything was not well with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) smiled, and talked and
laughed, there was something forced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) almost knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was only waiting till the man should have left the room
to speak in a different strain. And so it was. As soon as the last
lingering dish had been removed, and when the door was finally shut
behind the retreating waiter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked the question which no doubt
had been on her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mind since she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had walked across the strand to the
hotel. <div class="bookquote">``Your friend was hardly civil; was he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should have come in? I have no doubt it was true
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had dined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite indifferent about his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dinner,--but there are two ways of
declining as there are of accepting. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is on very intimate
terms with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) want of courtesy was the more evidently intended for me. In
point of fact he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) disapproves of me. Is not that it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>To this question
Montague did not feel himself called upon to make any immediate
answer. <div class="bookquote">``I can well understand that it should be so. An intimate
friend may like or dislike the friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) friend, without offence.
But unless there be strong reason he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is bound to be civil to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
friend's friend, when accident brings them together. You have told me
that Mr. Carbury was your beau ideal of an English gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) behave as such?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Hurtle again smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``Did not you yourself feel that you were rebuked for coming here with
me, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) expressed surprise at your journey? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) authority over
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) has not. What authority could he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I do not know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) may be your guardian. In this safe-going
country young men perhaps are not their own masters till they are
past thirty. I should have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was your guardian, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) intended to rebuke you for being in bad company. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did
after I had gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>This was so true that Montague did not know how to deny it. Nor was
he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) sure that it would be well that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) should deny it. The time must
come, and why not now as well as at any future moment? He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) had to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) could not join his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) lot with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),--chiefly
indeed because his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) heart was elsewhere, a reason on which he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) could
hardly insist because she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could allege that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had a prior right
to his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) heart;--but also because her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) antecedents had been such as to
cause all his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) friends to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) against such a marriage. So he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)
plucked up courage for the battle. <div class="bookquote">``It was nearly that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) said.

<p/>There are many,--and probably the greater portion of my readers
will be among the number,--who will declare to themselves that Paul
Montague was a poor creature, in that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) felt so great a repugnance
to face this woman with the truth. His (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) folly in falling at first
under the battery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) charms will be forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) engagement,
unwise as it was, and his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) subsequent determination to break his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)
engagement, will be pardoned. Women, and perhaps some men also, will
feel that it was natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) should have been charmed, natural
that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) should have expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) admiration in the form which
unmarried ladies expect from unmarried men when any such expression
is to be made at all;--natural also that he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) should endeavour to
escape from the dilemma when he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) found the manifold dangers of the
step which he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) had proposed to take. No woman, I think, will be hard
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) because of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) breach of faith to Mrs. Hurtle. But they
will be very hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) on the score of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) cowardice,--as, I think,
unjustly. In social life we hardly stop to consider how much of that
daring spirit which gives mastery comes from hardness of heart rather
than from high purpose, or true courage. The man who succumbs to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, the mother who succumbs to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter, the master who
succumbs to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) servant, is as often brought to servility by a
continual aversion to the giving of pain, by a softness which
causes the fretfulness of others to be an agony to himself,--as by
any actual fear which the firmness of the imperious one may have
produced. There is an inner softness, a thinness of the mind's skin,
an incapability of seeing or even thinking of the troubles of others
with equanimity, which produces a feeling akin to fear; but which
is compatible not only with courage, but with absolute firmness of
purpose, when the demand for firmness arises so strongly as to
assert itself. With this man it was not really that. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feared the
woman;--or at least such fears did not prevail upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be silent;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shrank from subjecting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the blank misery of utter
desertion. After what had passed between them he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly bring
himself to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no further and to bid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go.
But that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to do. And for that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last
question prepared the way. <div class="bookquote">``It was nearly that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carbury did take it upon himself to rebuke you for showing
yourself on the sands at Lowestoft with such a one as I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew of the letter which I wrote to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have canvassed me between you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we have. Is that unnatural? Would you have had me be
silent about you to the oldest and the best friend I have in the
world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I would not have had you be silent to your oldest and best
friend. I presume you would declare your purpose. But I should not
have supposed you would have asked his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) leave. When I was travelling
with you, I thought you were a man capable of managing your own
actions. I had heard that in your country girls sometimes hold
themselves at the disposal of their friends,--but I did not dream
that such could be the case with a man who had gone out into the
world to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul Montague did not like it. The punishment to be endured was being
commenced. <div class="bookquote">``Of course you can say bitter things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it my nature to say bitter things? Have I usually said bitter
things to you? When I have hung round your neck and have sworn that
you should be my God upon earth, was that bitter? I am alone and I
have to fight my own battles. A woman's weapon is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tongue. Say but
one word to me, Paul, as you know how to say it, and there will be
soon an end to that bitterness. What shall I care for Mr. Carbury,
except to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) the cause of some innocent joke, if you will speak
but that one word? And think what it is I am asking. Do you remember
how urgent were once your own prayers to me;--how you swore that
your happiness could only be secured by one word of mine? Though
I loved you, I doubted. There were considerations of money, which
have now vanished. But I spoke it,--because I loved you, and because
I believed you. Give me that which you swore you had given before
I made my gift to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say that word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that, after all, I am to be thrown off like an old
glove? I have had many dealings with men and have found them to be
false, cruel, unworthy, and selfish. But I have met nothing like
that. No man has ever dared to treat me like that. No man shall
dare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wrote to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wrote to me;--yes! And I was to take that as sufficient! No. I think
but little of my life and have but little for which to live. But
while I do live I will travel over the world's surface to face
injustice and to expose it, before I will put up with it. You wrote
to me! Heaven and earth;--I can hardly control myself when I hear
such impudence!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) fist upon the knife that lay on the

further distance. <div class="bookquote">``Wrote to me! Could any mere letter of your writing
break the bond by which we were bound together? Had not the distance
between us seemed to have made you safe would you have dared to
write that letter? The letter must be unwritten. It has already
been contradicted by your conduct to me since I have been in this
country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear you say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I not justified in saying it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not. When I first saw you I told you everything. If I have
been wrong in attending to your wishes since, I regret it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This comes from your seeing your master for two minutes on the
beach. You are acting now under his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) orders. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) came with the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) coming was an accident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very opportune at any rate. Well;--what have you to say to

that is required of you? Perhaps you would prefer that I should argue

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has to be said, I believe I can say myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say it then. Or are you so ashamed of it, that the words stick in
your throat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is some truth in that. I am ashamed of it. I must say that
which will be painful, and which would not have been to be said, had
I been fairly careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``Don't spare me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I know what it all is
as well as though it were already told. I know the lies with which
they have crammed you at San Francisco. You have heard that up in
Oregon--I shot a man. That is no lie. I did. I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down dead
at my feet.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) paused, and rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) chair, and looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you wonder that that is a story that a woman should hesitate
to tell? But not from shame. Do you suppose that the sight of that
dying wretch does not haunt me? that I do not daily hear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drunken
screech, and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bound from the earth, and then fall in a heap
just below my hand? But did they tell you also that it was thus
alone that I could save myself,--and that had I spared him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I must
afterwards have destroyed myself? If I were wrong, why did they not
try me for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murder? Why did the women flock around me and kiss the
very hems of my garments? In this soft civilization of yours you know
nothing of such necessity. A woman here is protected,--unless it be
from lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not that only,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; they told you other things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) continued, still standing over
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They told you of quarrels with my husband. I know the lies,
and who made them, and why. Did I conceal from you the character of
my former husband? Did I not tell you that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a drunkard and a
scoundrel? How should I not quarrel with such a one? Ah, Paul; you
can hardly know what my life has been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They told me that--you fought him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha;--fought him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! Yes;--I was always fighting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). What are you to
do but to fight cruelty, and fight falsehood, and fight fraud and
treachery,--when they come upon you and would overwhelm you but for
fighting? You have not been fool enough to believe that fable about a
duel? I did stand once, armed, and guarded my bedroom door from him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>),
and told him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) should only enter it over my body. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) went away
to the tavern and I did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) for a week afterwards. That was
the duel. And they have told you that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is not dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--they have told me that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) alive? I never said to you that I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
dead. How should I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There would be a certificate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certificate;--in the back of Texas;--five hundred miles from
Galveston! And what would it matter to you? I was divorced from him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
according to the law of the State of Kansas. Does not the law make
a woman free here to marry again,--and why not with us? I sued
for a divorce on the score of cruelty and drunkenness. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) made no
appearance, and the Court granted it me. Am I disgraced by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard nothing of the divorce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not remember. When we were talking of these old days before,
you did not care how short I was in telling my story. You wanted to
hear little or nothing then of Caradoc Hurtle. Now you have become
more particular. I told you that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was dead,--as I believed myself,
and do believe. Whether the other story was told or not I do not
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it was your own fault,--because you would not listen. And they
have made you believe I suppose that I have failed in getting back my
property?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard nothing about your property but what you yourself have
said unasked. I have asked no question about your property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are welcome. At last I have made it again my own. And now, sir,
what else is there? I think I have been open with you. Is it because
I protected myself from drunken violence that I am to be rejected? Am
I to be cast aside because I saved my life while in the hands of a
reprobate husband, and escaped from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by means provided by law;--or
because by my own energy I have secured my own property? If I am not
to be condemned for these things, then say why am I condemned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had at any rate saved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the trouble of telling the story, but
in doing so had left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without a word to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had owned to
shooting the man. Well; it certainly may be necessary that a woman
should shoot a man--especially in Oregon. As to the duel with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
husband,--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had half denied and half confessed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presumed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been armed with a pistol when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refused Mr. Hurtle
admittance into the nuptial chamber. As to the question of Hurtle's
death,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had confessed that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was not dead. But then,--as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had asked,--why should not a divorce for the purpose in hand
be considered as good as a death? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could not say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
not washed herself clean;--and yet, from the story as told by
herself, what man would wish to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had seen so much of
drunkenness, had become so handy with pistols, and had done so much
of a man's work, that any ordinary man might well hesitate before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
assumed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) master. <div class="bookquote">``I do not condemn you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, Paul, do not lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``If you tell me that
you will not be my husband, you do condemn me. Is it not so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not lie if I can help it. I did ask you to be my wife--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--rather. How often before I consented?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It matters little; at any rate, till you did consent. I have since
satisfied myself that such a marriage would be miserable for both of
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have. Of course, you can speak of me as you please and think of me
as you please. I can hardly defend myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, with whatever result, I know that I shall now be acting for the
best in declaring that I will not become--your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was still standing, and stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) right
hand as though again to grasp something.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also now rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``If I speak with abruptness it is
only to avoid a show of indecision. I will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, God! what have I done that it should be my lot to meet man after
man false and cruel as this! You tell me to my face that I am to bear
it! Who is the jade that has done it? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) money?--or rank? Or is
it that you are afraid to have by your side a woman who can speak
for herself,--and even act for herself if some action be necessary?
Perhaps you think that I am--old.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) intently as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) spoke, and it did seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that many years had been added to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) face. It was full of lines round the mouth, and the light play
of drollery was gone, and the colour was fixed,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) eyes seemed
to be deep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Speak, man,--is it that you want a younger
wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know it is not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Know! How should any one know anything from a liar? From what
you tell me I know nothing. I have to gather what I can from your
character. I see that you are a coward. It is that man that came to
you, and who is your master, that has forced you to this. Between me
and him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) you tremble, and are a thing to be pitied. As for knowing
what you would be at, from anything that you would say,--that
is impossible. Once again I have come across a mean wretch. Oh,
fool!--that men should be so vile, and think themselves masters of
the world! My last word to you is, that you are--a liar. Now for the
present you can go. Ten minutes since, had I had a weapon in my hand
I should have shot another man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul Montague, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked round the room for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, could not but
think that perhaps Mrs. Hurtle might have had some excuse. It seemed
at any rate to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) custom to have a pistol with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>),--though
luckily, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comfort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had left it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) bedroom on the
present occasion. <div class="bookquote">``I will say good-bye to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
found his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say no such thing. Tell me that you have triumphed and got rid of
me. Pluck up your spirits, if you have any, and show me your joy.
Tell me that an Englishman has dared to ill-treat an American woman.
You would,--were you not afraid to indulge yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now
standing in the doorway, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escaped she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an
imperative command. <div class="bookquote">``I shall not stay here now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``I shall
return on Monday. I must think of what you have said, and must
resolve what I myself will do. I shall not bear this without seeking
a means of punishing you for your treachery. I shall expect you to
come to me on Monday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) closed the door as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I do not see that it will
serve any purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is for me, sir, to judge of that. I suppose you are not so much a
coward that you are afraid to come to me. If so, I shall come to you;
and you may be assured that I shall not be too timid to show myself
and to tell my story.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ended by saying that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) desired it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would wait upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not at present fix a day. On
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return to town he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>).

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) went to the door and listened awhile. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
closed it, and turning the lock, stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) back against the door
and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hands clasped. After a few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) ran forward, and
falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) knees, buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hands upon the table.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) gave way to a flood of tears, and at last lay rolling upon
the floor.

<p/>Was this to be the end of it? Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) never know rest;--never have
one draught of cool water between her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) lips? Was there to be no end to
the storms and turmoils and misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) life? In almost all that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had spoken the truth, though doubtless not all the
truth,--as which among us would in giving the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) life? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
had endured violence, and had been violent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had been schemed
against, and had schemed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had fitted herself to the life which
had befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). But in regard to money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had been honest and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
had been loving of heart. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) heart of hearts she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had loved this
young Englishman;--and now, after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) scheming, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) daring,
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) charms, this was to be the end of it! Oh, what a journey
would this be which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) must now make back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own country, all
alone!

<p/>But the strongest feeling which raged within her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) bosom was that of
disappointed love. Full as had been the vials of wrath which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
poured forth over Montague's head, violent as had been the storm
of abuse with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), there had been after all
something counterfeited in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) indignation. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) love was no
counterfeit. At any moment if he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) would have returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) and
taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would not only have forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) but have
blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) also for his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) kindness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was in truth sick at heart of
violence and rough living and unfeminine words. When driven by wrongs
the old habit came back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could only escape the
wrongs, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could find some niche in the world which would be
bearable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), in which, free from harsh treatment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could pour
forth all the genuine kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) woman's nature,--then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could put away violence and be gentle as a young girl.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) first met this Englishman and found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) took delight in
being near her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had ventured to hope that a haven would at last
be open to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). But the reek of the gunpowder from that first pistol
shot still clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) now told herself again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
often told herself before, that it would have been better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to
have turned the muzzle against her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own bosom.

<p/>After receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had run over on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had told
herself was a vain chance. Though angry enough when that letter first
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had, with that force of character which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>),
declared to herself that such a resolution on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) part was natural.
In marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) must give up all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) old allies, all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) old
haunts. The whole world must be changed to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) knew enough of
herself, and enough of Englishwomen, to be sure that when her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) past
life should be known, as it would be known, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would be avoided in
England. With all the little ridicule she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was wont to exercise in
speaking of the old country there was ever mixed, as is so often
the case in the minds of American men and women, an almost envious
admiration of English excellence. To have been allowed to forget the
past and to live the life of an English lady would have been heaven
to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), who was sometimes scorned and sometimes feared in
the eastern cities of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own country, whose name had become almost a
proverb for violence out in the far West,--how could she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dare to hope
that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lot should be so changed for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had reminded Paul that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had required to be asked often before
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had consented to be his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wife; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that that
hesitation had arisen from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own unfitness.
But it had been so. Circumstances had made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was.
Circumstances had been cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not now alter
them. Then gradually, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) love, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lost
herself in love for him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be changed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had, however, almost known that it could not be so. But this man
had relatives, had business, had property in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own country. Though
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not be made happy in England, might not a prosperous life
be opened for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the far West? Then had risen the offer of that
journey to Mexico with much probability that work of no ordinary
kind might detain him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) there for years. With what joy would she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have
accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife! For that at any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have been
fit.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was conscious,--perhaps too conscious, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own beauty. That at
any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt, had not deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was hardly aware that
time was touching it. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew herself to be clever, capable of
causing happiness, and mirth and comfort. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had the qualities of
a good comrade--which are so much in a woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew all this of
herself. If he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could be together in some country in which
those stories of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) past life would be matter of indifference, could
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not make him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) happy? But what was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that a man should give up
everything and go away and spend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days in some half-barbarous
country for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) alone? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew it all and was hardly angry with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had decided against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But treated as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must play her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) game with such weapons as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) possessed. It was
consonant with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old character, it was consonant with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) present
plans that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should at any rate seem to be angry.

<p/>Sitting there alone late into the night she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made many plans, but the
plan that seemed best to suit the present frame of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind was
the writing of a letter to Paul bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) adieu, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
fondest love, and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did write the
letter, but wrote it with a conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not have the
strength to send it to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). The reader may judge with what feeling
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) wrote the following words:--


<p/>DEAR PAUL,--

<p/>You are right and I am wrong. Our marriage would not have
been fitting. I do not blame you. I attracted you when
we were together; but you have learned and have learned
truly that you should not give up your life for such
attractions. If I have been violent with you, forgive me.
You will acknowledge that I have suffered.

<p/>Always know that there is one woman who will love you
better than any one else. I think too that you will love
me even when some other woman is by your side. God bless
you, and make you happy. Write me the shortest, shortest
word of adieu. Not to do so would make you think yourself
heartless. But do not come to me.

<p/>For ever,

<p/>W. H.


<p/>This she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrote on a small slip of paper, and then having read it
twice, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket-book. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
ought to send it; but told herself as plainly that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not
bring herself to do so. It was early in the morning before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went
to bed but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had admitted no one into the room after Montague had
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>).

<p/>Paul, when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) escaped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) presence, roamed out on to the
sea-shore, and then took himself to bed, having ordered a conveyance
to take him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to Carbury Manor early in the morning. At breakfast
he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) presented himself to the squire. <div class="bookquote">``I have come earlier than you
expected,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed;--much earlier. Are you going back to Lowestoft?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) told the whole story. Roger expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) satisfaction,
recalling however the pledge which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had given as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) return.
<div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) follow you, and bear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Of course you must
suffer the effects of your own imprudence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>On that evening Paul
Montague returned to London by the mail train, being sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
would thus avoid a meeting with Mrs. Hurtle in the railway-carriage.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII.

<p/>RUBY A PRISONER.


<p/>Ruby had run away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover in great dudgeon after the dance at
the Music Hall, and had declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) never wanted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
again. But when reflection came with the morning her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) misery was
stronger than her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) wrath. What would life be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) now without her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
lover? When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) escaped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) grandfather's house she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) certainly
had not intended to become nurse and assistant maid-of-all-work at a
London lodging-house. The daily toil she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could endure, and the hard
life, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was supported by the prospect of some coming
delight. A dance with Felix at the Music Hall, though it were three
days distant from her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), would so occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could wash
and dress all the children without complaint. Mrs. Pipkin was forced
to own to herself that Ruby did earn her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) bread. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had
parted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover almost on an understanding that they were never
to meet again, things were very different with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). And perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
had been wrong. A gentleman like Sir Felix did not of course like to
be told about marriage. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) another chance, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
would speak. At any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could not live without another dance.
And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a letter.

<p/>Ruby was glib enough with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) pen, though what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) wrote will hardly
bear repeating. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) underscored all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) loves to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) underscored
the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) regret if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did not want
to hurry a gentleman. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did want to have another dance at the
Music Hall. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) be there next Saturday? Sir Felix sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a
very short reply to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be at the Music Hall on the
Tuesday. As at this time he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) proposed to leave London on the Wednesday
on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way to New York, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was proposing to devote his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) very last
night to the companionship of Ruby Ruggles.

<p/>Mrs. Pipkin had never interfered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) niece's letters. It is
certainly a part of the new dispensation that young women shall send
and receive letters without inspection. But since Roger Carbury's
visit Mrs. Pipkin had watched the postman, and had also watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
niece. For nearly a week Ruby said not a word of going out at night.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) took the children for an airing in a broken perambulator, nearly
as far as Holloway, with exemplary care, and washed up the cups and
saucers as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) mind was intent upon them. But Mrs. Pipkin's
mind was intent on obeying Mr. Carbury's behests. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had already
hinted something as to which Ruby had made no answer. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
purpose to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) and to swear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) most solemnly,--should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
find her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) preparing herself to leave the house after six in the
evening,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) should be kept out the whole night, having a
purpose equally clear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would break her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) oath
should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) be unsuccessful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) effort to keep Ruby at home. But on
the Tuesday, when Ruby went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) room to deck herself, a bright
idea as to a better precaution struck Mrs. Pipkin's mind. Ruby had
been careless,--had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover's scrap of a note in an old pocket
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) went out with the children, and Mrs. Pipkin knew all about
it. It was nine o'clock when Ruby went up-stairs,--and then Mrs.
Pipkin locked both the front door and the area gate. Mrs. Hurtle
had come home on the previous day. <div class="bookquote">``You won't be wanting to go out
to-night;--will you, Mrs. Hurtle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin, knocking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
lodger's door. Mrs. Hurtle declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) purpose of remaining at home
all the evening. <div class="bookquote">``If you should hear words between me and my niece,
don't you mind, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope there's nothing wrong, Mrs. Pipkin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'ll be wanting to go out, and I won't have it. It isn't right;
is it, ma'am? She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'s a good girl; but they've got such a way nowadays
of doing just as they pleases, that one doesn't know what's going to
come next.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Pipkin must have feared downright rebellion when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
thus took her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) lodger into her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) confidence.

<p/>Ruby came down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) silk frock, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had done before, and made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) usual little speech. <div class="bookquote">``I'm just going to step out, aunt, for a
little time to-night. I've got the key, and I'll let myself in quite
quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Ruby, you won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't what, aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't let yourself in, if you go out. If you go out to-night you'll
stay out. That's all about it. If you go out to-night you won't
come back here any more. I won't have it, and it isn't right that
I should. You're going after that young man that they tell me is the
greatest scamp in all England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They tell you lies then, Aunt Pipkin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. No girl is going out any more at nights out of my house;
so that's all about it. If you had told me you was going before, you
needn't have gone up and bedizened yourself. For now it's all to take
off again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div><p/>Ruby could hardly believe it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had expected some opposition,--what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) would have called a few words; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had never imagined that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) aunt would threaten to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) in the streets all night. It
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had bought the privilege of amusing herself by
hard work. Nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) believe now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) aunt would be as hard as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) threat. <div class="bookquote">``I've a right to go if I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's as you think. You haven't a right to come back again, any
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have. I've worked for you a deal harder than the girl
down-stairs, and I don't want no wages. I've a right to go out, and a
right to come back;--and go I shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be no better than you should be, if you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to work my very nails off, and push that perambulator about all
day till my legs won't carry me,--and then I ain't to go out, not
once in a week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not unless I know more about it, Ruby. I won't have you go and throw
yourself into the gutter;--not while you're with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's throwing themselves into the gutter? I've thrown myself into
no gutter. I know what I'm about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's two of us that way, Ruby;--for I know what I'm about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall just go then.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>And Ruby walked off towards the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't get out that way, any way, for the door's locked;--and
the area gate. You'd better be said, Ruby, and just take your things
off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Poor Ruby</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Ruby for the moment was struck dumb with mortification. Mrs.
Pipkin had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) credit for more outrageous perseverance than she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
possessed, and had feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) would rattle at the front door,
or attempt to climb over the area gate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was a little afraid of
Ruby, not feeling herself justified in holding absolute dominion
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) as over a servant. And though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was now determined in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) conduct,--being fully resolved to surrender neither of the keys
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) pocket,--still she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) might so
far collapse as to fall away into tears, should Ruby be violent.
But Ruby was crushed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover would be there to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>), and the
appointment would be broken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)! <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Pipkin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``let me
go just this once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Ruby;--it ain't proper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know what you're a' doing of, aunt; you don't. You'll ruin
me,--you will. Dear Aunt Pipkin, do, do! I'll never ask again, if you
don't like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pipkin had not expected this, and was almost willing to yield.
But Mr. Carbury had spoken so very plainly! <div class="bookquote">``It ain't the thing,
Ruby; and I won't do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm to be--a prisoner! What have I done to be--a prisoner? I
don't believe as you've any right to lock me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a right to lock my own doors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall go away to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help that, my dear. The door will be open to-morrow, if you
choose to go out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why not open it to-night? Where's the difference?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>But Mrs.
Pipkin was stern, and Ruby, in a flood of tears, took herself up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) garret.

<p/>Mrs. Pipkin knocked at Mrs. Hurtle's door again. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s gone to bed,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to hear it. There wasn't any noise about it;--was there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as I expected, Mrs. Hurtle, certainly. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was put out a
bit. Poor girl! I've been a girl too, and used to like a bit of
outing as well as any one,--and a dance too; only it was always when
mother knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ain't got a mother, poor dear! and as good as no
father. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s got it into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s that pretty that a
great gentleman will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is pretty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's beauty, Mrs. Hurtle? It's no more nor skin deep, as the
scriptures tell us. And what'd a grand gentleman see in Ruby to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'ll leave to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where will she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just nowhere. After this gentleman,--and you know what that means!
You're going to be married yourself, Mrs. Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We won't mind about that now, Mrs. Pipkin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this 'll be your second, and you know how these things are
managed. No gentleman 'll marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) runs after him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Girls
as knows what they're about should let the gentlemen run after them.
That's my way of looking at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think they should be equal in that respect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyways the girls shouldn't let on as they are running after the
gentlemen. A gentleman goes here and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) goes there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) speaks
up free, of course. In my time, girls usen't to do that. But then,
maybe, I'm old-fashioned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Pipkin, thinking of the new
dispensation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose girls do speak for themselves more than they did
formerly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A deal more, Mrs. Hurtle; quite different. You hear them talk of
spooning with this fellow, and spooning with that fellow,--and that
before their very fathers and mothers! When I was young we used to do
it, I suppose,--only not like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did it on the sly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we got married quicker than they do, any way. When the
gentlemen had to take more trouble they thought more about it. But
if you wouldn't mind speaking to Ruby to-morrow, Mrs. Hurtle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)'d
listen to you when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) wouldn't mind a word I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). I don't
want her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to go away from this, out into the street, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) knows
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)'s to go to, decent. As for going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) young man,--that's
just walking the streets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hurtle promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would speak to Ruby, though when making
the promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could not but think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) unfitness for the task.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) knew nothing of the country. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had not a single friend in
it, but Paul Montague;--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had run after him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with as little
discretion as Ruby Ruggles was showing in running after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) lover.
Who was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) should take upon herself to give advice to any
female?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had not sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) letter to Paul, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) still kept it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
pocket-book. At some moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) would send it; and
at others she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) would never surrender this last
hope till every stone had been turned. It might still be possible
to shame him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) into a marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had returned from Lowestoft on
the Monday, and had made some trivial excuse to Mrs. Pipkin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
mildest voice. The place had been windy, and too cold for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>);--and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had not liked the hotel. Mrs. Pipkin was very glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
back again.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIX.

<p/>SIR FELIX MAKES HIMSELF READY.


<p/>Sir Felix, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) promised to meet Ruby at the Music Hall on the
Tuesday, was under an engagement to start with Marie Melmotte for New
York on the Thursday following, and to go down to Liverpool on the
Wednesday. There was no reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) thought, why he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should not enjoy
himself to the last, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would say a parting word to poor little
Ruby. The details of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) journey were settled between him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) and Marie,
with no inconsiderable assistance from Didon, in the garden of
Grosvenor Square, on the previous Sunday,--where the lovers had
again met during the hours of morning service. Sir Felix had been
astonished at the completion of the preparations which had been made.
<div class="bookquote">``Mind you go by the 5 P.M. train,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie said. <div class="bookquote">``That will take you
into Liverpool at 10.15. There's an hotel at the railway-station.
Didon has got our tickets under the names of Madame and Mademoiselle
Racine. We are to have one cabin between us. You must get yours
to-morrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) has found out that there is plenty of room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't miss the train that afternoon. Somebody would be sure
to suspect something if we were seen together in the same train. We
leave at 7 A.M. I shan't go to bed all night, so as to be sure to be
in time. Robert,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)'s the man,--will start a little earlier in the
cab with my heavy box. What do you think is in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>suggested Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but what clothes?--my wedding dresses. Think of that! What a
job to get them and nobody to know anything about it except Didon and
Madame Craik at the shop in Mount Street! They haven't come yet, but
I shall be there whether they come or not. And I shall have all my
jewels. I'm not going to leave them behind. They'll go off in our
cab. We can get the things out behind the house into the mews. Then
Didon and I follow in another cab. Nobody ever is up before near
nine, and I don't think we shall be interrupted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If the servants were to hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think they'd tell. But if I was to be brought back again,
I should only tell papa that it was no good. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) can't prevent me
marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't your mother find out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never looks after anything. I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d tell if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
knew. Papa leads her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) such a life! Felix! I hope you won't be like
that.'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) face, and thought that it would be
impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix, feeling very uncomfortable at the time.
This great effort of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) life was drawing very near. There had been
a pleasurable excitement in talking of running away with the great
heiress of the day, but now that the deed had to be executed,--and
executed after so novel and stupendous a fashion, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) almost wished
that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had not undertaken it. It must have been much nicer when men
ran away with their heiresses only as far as Gretna Green. And even
Goldsheiner with Lady Julia had nothing of a job in comparison with
this which he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) was expected to perform. And then if they should be
wrong about the girl's fortune! He (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) almost repented. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) did repent,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) had not the courage to recede. <div class="bookquote">``How about money though?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>)
said hoarsely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have got some?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just the two hundred pounds which your father paid me, and
not a shilling more. I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should keep my money, and not
let me have it back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) pocket.
<div class="bookquote">``I told you I thought I could get some. There is a cheque for two
hundred and fifty pounds. I had money of my own enough for the
tickets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And whose is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix, taking the bit of paper with much
trepidation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is papa's cheque. Mamma gets ever so many of them to carry on the
house and pay for things. But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gets so muddled about it that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
doesn't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pays and what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) doesn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Felix looked at the
cheque and saw that it was payable to House or Bearer, and that it
was signed by Augustus Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``If you take it to the bank you'll
get the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. <div class="bookquote">``Or shall I send Didon, and give you the
money on board the ship?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Felix thought over the matter very anxiously. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did go on the
journey he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would much prefer to have the money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
liked the feeling of having money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pocket. Perhaps if Didon
were entrusted with the cheque she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) also would like the feeling. But
then might it not be possible that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) presented the cheque himself
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might be arrested for stealing Melmotte's money? <div class="bookquote">``I think Didon
had better get the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and bring it to me to-morrow,
at four o'clock in the afternoon, to the club.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If the money did
not come he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would not go down to Liverpool, nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) be at the
expense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ticket for New York. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm so much
in the City that they might know me at the bank.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To this arrangement
Marie assented and took back the cheque. <div class="bookquote">``And then I'll come on board
on Thursday morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``without looking for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes;--without looking for us. And don't know us even till
we are out at sea. Won't it be fun when we shall be walking about on
the deck and not speaking to one another! And, Felix;--what do you
think? Didon has found out that there is to be an American clergyman
on board. I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)'d marry us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't that be jolly? I wish it was all done. Then, directly it's
done, and when we get to New York, we'll telegraph and write to papa,
and we'll be ever so penitent and good; won't we? Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll
make the best of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s so savage; isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When there's anything to get;--or just at the moment. But I don't
think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) minds afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s always for making the best of
everything;--misfortunes and all. Things go wrong so often that if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
was to go on thinking of them always they'd be too many for anybody.
It'll be all right in a month's time. I wonder how Lord Nidderdale
will look when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) hears that we've gone off. I should so like to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) never can say that I've behaved bad to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). We were engaged,
but it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) broke it. Do you know, Felix, that though we were
engaged to be married, and everybody knew it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) never once kissed
me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Felix at this moment almost wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had never done so. As
to what the other man had done, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cared nothing at all.

<p/>Then they parted with the understanding that they were not to see
each other again till they met on board the boat. All arrangements
were made. But Felix was determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not stir in the
matter unless Didon brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the full sum of #250; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost
thought, and indeed hoped, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would not. Either she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would be
suspected at the bank and apprehended, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would run off with the
money on her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own account when she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) got it;--or the cheque would have
been missed and the payment stopped. Some accident would occur, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be able to recede from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) undertaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do
nothing till after Monday afternoon.

<p/>Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going? His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother had clearly
recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to run away with the girl, and must therefore approve
of the measure. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother would understand how great would be the
expense of such a trip, and might perhaps add something to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stock
of money. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother;--that is, if
Didon should bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) full change for the cheque.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked into the Beargarden exactly at four o'clock on the Monday,
and there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found Didon standing in the hall. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart sank within
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Now must he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly go to New York. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
a little curtsey, and without a word handed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an envelope, soft and
fat with rich enclosures. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wait a moment, and going into a
little waiting-room counted the notes. The money was all there;--the
full sum of #250. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must certainly go to New York. <div class="bookquote">``C'est tout en
règle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Didon/Madame Didon</b></font>)</div>said Didon in a whisper as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned to the hall. Sir Felix
nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and Didon took her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) departure.

<p/>Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must go now. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had Melmotte's money in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, and was
therefore bound to run away with Melmotte's daughter. It was a great
trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) reflected that Melmotte had more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) money
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had of Melmotte's. And now how should he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) dispose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) time
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went? Gambling was too dangerous. Even he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) felt that. Where
would he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) be were he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ready money? He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would dine that night
at the club, and in the evening go up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mother. On the Tuesday
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would take his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) place for New York in the City, and would spend the
evening with Ruby at the Music Hall. On the Wednesday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would start
for Liverpool,--according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) instructions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) felt annoyed that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been so fully instructed. But should the affair turn out well
nobody would know that. All the fellows would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) credit for the
audacity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had carried off the heiress to America.

<p/>At ten o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mother and Hetta in Welbeck
Street--<div class="bookquote">``What; Felix?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're surprised; are you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) threw himself into a chair.
<div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``would you mind coming into the other room?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lady
Carbury of course went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I've got something to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good news?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) asked, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hands together. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) manner
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought that it was good news. Money had in some way come into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands,--or at any rate a prospect of money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's as may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't keep me in suspense, Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The long and the short of it is that I'm going to take Marie off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said you thought it was the right thing to do;--and therefore
I'm going to do it. The worst of it is that one wants such a lot of
money for this kind of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Immediately. I wouldn't tell you till I had arranged everything.
I've had it in my mind for the last fortnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how is it to be? Oh, Felix, I hope it may succeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was your own idea, you know. We're going to;--where do you
think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I think?--Boulogne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say that just because Goldsheiner went there. That wouldn't have
done at all for us. We're going to--New York.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To New York! But when will you be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be a clergyman on board. It's all fixed. I wouldn't go
without telling you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh; I wish you hadn't told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now;--that's kind. You don't mean to say it wasn't you that put
me up to it. I've got to get my things ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if you tell me that you are going on a journey, I will
have your clothes got ready for you. When do you start?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wednesday afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For New York! We must get some things ready-made. Oh, Felix, how
will it be if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) attempted to laugh. <div class="bookquote">``When
I spoke of such a thing as possible he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had not sworn then that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
would never give her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a shilling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They always say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going to risk it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to take your advice.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>This was dreadful to the poor
mother. <div class="bookquote">``There is money settled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Settled on whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On Marie;--money which he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can't get back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) doesn't know;--but a great deal; enough for them all to live
upon if things went amiss with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that's only a form, Felix. That money can't be her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own, to give
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Melmotte will find that it is, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) comes to terms. That's the
pull we've got over him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Marie knows what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s a great
deal sharper than any one would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to be. What can you do for
me about money, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have none, Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd be sure to help me, as you wanted me so much to do
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not true, Felix. I didn't want you to do it. Oh, I am so
sorry that that word ever passed my mouth! I have no money. There
isn't #20 at the bank altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They would let you overdraw for #50 or #60.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not do it. I will not starve myself and Hetta. You had
ever so much money only lately. I will get some things for you,
and pay for them as I can if you cannot pay for them after your
marriage;--but I have not money to give you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a blue look out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), turning himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
chair,--<div class="bookquote">``just when #60 or #70 might make a fellow for life! You could
borrow it from your friend Broune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do no such thing, Felix. #50 or #60 would make very little
difference in the expense of such a trip as this. I suppose you have
some money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some;--yes, some. But I'm so short that any little thing would help
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Before the evening was over she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) absolutely did give him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) a cheque
for #30, although she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had spoken the truth in saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not
so much at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) banker's.

<p/>After this he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) club, although he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) himself understood
the danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) could not bear the idea of going to bed quietly at
home at half-past ten. He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) got into a cab, and was very soon up in the
card-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) found nobody there, and went to the smoking-room, where
Dolly Longestaffe and Miles Grendall were sitting silently together,
with pipes in their mouths. <div class="bookquote">``Here's Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, waking
suddenly into life. <div class="bookquote">``Now we can have a game at three-handed loo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank ye; not for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``I hate three-handed loo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dummy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>suggested Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I'll play to-night, old fellow. I hate three fellows
sticking down together.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>Miles sat silent, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) pipe,
conscious of the baronet's dislike to play with him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``By-the-bye,
Grendall,--look here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>And Sir Felix in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) most friendly tone
whispered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) enemy's ear a petition that some of the I. O. U.``s
might be converted into cash.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Pon my word, I must ask you to wait till next week,''  (<font color='red'><b>I. O. U.</b></font>)</div>said Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's always waiting till next week with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix,
getting up and standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) back to the fire-place. There were
other men in the room, and this was said so that every one should
hear it. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether any fellow would buy these for five
shillings in the pound?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) held up the scraps of paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) had been drinking freely before he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) went up to Welbeck
Street, and had taken a glass of brandy on re-entering the club.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let's have any of that kind of thing down here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.
<div class="bookquote">``If there is to be a row about cards, let it be in the card-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles. <div class="bookquote">``I won't say a word about the matter down
here. It isn't the proper thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come up into the card-room, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, getting up from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that it makes no difference to you, what
room you're in. Come up, now; and Dolly Longestaffe shall come and
hear what you say.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>But Miles Grendall objected to this arrangement.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was not going up into the card-room that night, as no one was
going to play. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) would be there to-morrow, and then if Sir Felix
Carbury had anything to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) could say it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I do hate a row!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``One has to have rows with one's
own people, but there ought not to be rows at a club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) likes a row,--Carbury does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like my money, if I could get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, walking
out of the room.

<p/>On the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) went into the City, and changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mother's
cheque. This was done after a little hesitation. The money was given
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>), but a gentleman from behind the desks begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) to remind
Lady Carbury that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was overdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) account. <div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear;''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said
Sir Felix, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) pocketed the notes, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was unaware of
it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) passage from Liverpool to New York under
the name of Walter Jones, and felt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) did so that the intrigue was
becoming very deep. This was on Tuesday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) dined again at the club,
alone, and in the evening went to the Music Hall. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) remained
from ten till nearly twelve, very angry at the non-appearance of Ruby
Ruggles. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) smoked and drank in solitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) almost made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had intended to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) departure for New York.
Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) would have done no such thing. But now, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) ever
complain on that head he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) would have his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) answer ready. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had devoted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) last night in England to the purpose of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had
broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) appointment. Everything would now be her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) fault. Whatever
might happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could not blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>).

<p/>Having waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was sick of the Music Hall,--for a music hall
without ladies' society must be somewhat dull,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
club. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) was very cross, as brave as brandy could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), and well
inclined to expose Miles Grendall if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) could find an opportunity. Up
in the card-room he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) found all the accustomed men,--with the exception
of Miles Grendall. Nidderdale, Grasslough, Dolly, Paul Montague, and
one or two others were there. There was, at any rate, comfort in
the idea of playing without having to encounter the dead weight of
Miles Grendall. Ready money was on the table,--and there was none
of the peculiar Beargarden paper flying about. Indeed the men at the
Beargarden had become sick of paper, and there had been formed a
half-expressed resolution that the play should be somewhat lower, but
the payments punctual. The I. O. U.``s had been nearly all converted
into money,--with the assistance of Herr Vossner,--excepting those
of Miles Grendall. The resolution mentioned did not refer back to
Grendall's former indebtedness, but was intended to include a clause
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) must in future pay ready money. Nidderdale had communicated
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) the determination of the committee. ``Bygones are bygones, old
fellow; but you really must stump up, you know, after this.'' Miles
had declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``stump up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But on this occasion Miles was
absent.

<p/>At three o'clock in the morning, Sir Felix had lost over a hundred
pounds in ready money. On the following night about one he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) had lost a
further sum of two hundred pounds. The reader will remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
should at that time have been in the hotel at Liverpool.

<p/>But Sir Felix, as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) played on in the almost desperate hope of
recovering the money which he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) so greatly needed, remembered how
Fisker had played all night, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had gone off from the club to
catch the early train for Liverpool, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had gone on to New
York without delay.




<p/>CHAPTER L.

<p/>THE JOURNEY TO LIVERPOOL.


<p/>Marie Melmotte, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had promised, sat up all night, as did also
the faithful Didon. I think that to Marie the night was full of
pleasure,--or at any rate of pleasurable excitement. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) door
locked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) packed and unpacked and repacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) treasures,--having
more than once laid out on the bed the dress in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) purposed
to be married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) asked Didon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) opinion whether that American
clergyman of whom they had heard would marry them on board, and
whether in that event the dress would be fit for the occasion. Didon
thought that the man, if sufficiently paid, would marry them, and
that the dress would not much signify. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) young mistress
very often during the night for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) called nonsense; but was
true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and worked hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). They determined to go without
food in the morning, so that no suspicion should be raised by
the use of cups and plates. They could get refreshment at the
railway-station.

<p/>At six they started. Robert went first with the big boxes, having his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)
ten pounds already in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pocket,--and Marie and Didon with smaller
luggage followed in a second cab. No one interfered with them and
nothing went wrong. The very civil man at Euston Square gave them
their tickets, and even attempted to speak to them in French. They
had quite determined that not a word of English was to be spoken by
Marie till the ship was out at sea. At the station they got some very
bad tea and almost uneatable food,--but Marie's restrained excitement
was so great that food was almost unnecessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). They took their
seats without any impediment,--and then they were off.

<p/>During a great part of the journey they were alone, and then Marie
gabbled to Didon about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hopes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) future career, and all the
things she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would do;--how she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had hated Lord Nidderdale;--especially
when, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been awed into accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) no
token of love;--<div class="bookquote">``pas un baiser!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Didon suggested that such was the
way with English lords. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) herself had preferred Lord Nidderdale,
but had been willing to join in the present plan,--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, from
devoted affection to Marie. Marie went on to say that Nidderdale was
ugly, and that Sir Felix was as beautiful as the morning. <div class="bookquote">``Bah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Didon/Madame Didon</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Didon, who was really disgusted that such considerations
should prevail. Didon had learned in some indistinct way that Lord
Nidderdale would be a marquis and would have a castle, whereas Sir
Felix would never be more than Sir Felix, and, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) own, would
never have anything at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had striven with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mistress, but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mistress liked to have a will of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own. Didon no doubt had
thought that New York, with #50 and other perquisites in hand, might
offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a new career. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had therefore yielded, but even now could
hardly forbear from expressing disgust at the folly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mistress.
Marie bore it with imperturbable good humour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was running
away,--and was running to a distant continent,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover would
be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) gave Didon to understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) cared nothing for
marquises.

<p/>As they drew near to Liverpool Didon explained that they must still
be very careful. It would not do for them to declare at once their
destination on the platform,--so that every one about the station
should know that they were going on board the packet for New York.
They had time enough. They must leisurely look for the big boxes and
other things, and need say nothing about the steam packet till they
were in a cab. Marie's big box was directed simply <div class="bookquote">``Madame Racine,
Passenger to Liverpool;'' (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>--so also was directed a second box, nearly
as big, which was Didon's property. Didon declared that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) anxiety
would not be over till she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) found the ship moving under her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). Marie was
sure that all their dangers were over,--if only Sir Felix was safe
on board. Poor Marie! Sir Felix was at this moment in Welbeck Street,
striving to find temporary oblivion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) distressing situation and
loss of money, and some alleviation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) racking temples, beneath
the bedclothes.

<p/>When the train ran into the station at Liverpool the two women sat
for a few moments quite quiet. They would not seek remark by any
hurry or noise. The door was opened, and a well-mannered porter
offered to take their luggage. Didon handed out the various packages,
keeping however the jewel-case in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) left the
carriage first, and then Marie. But Marie had hardly put her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) foot
on the platform, before a gentleman addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), touching his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat,
<div class="bookquote">``You, I think, are Miss Melmotte.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Marie was struck dumb, but said
nothing. Didon immediately became voluble in French. No; the young
lady was not Miss Melmotte; the young lady was Mademoiselle Racine,
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was Madame Racine. Melmotte! What was Melmotte? They
knew nothing about Melmottes. Would the gentleman kindly allow them
to pass on to their cab?


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``You, I think, are Miss Melmotte.'' (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>But the gentleman would by no means kindly allow them to pass on to
their cab. With the gentleman was another gentleman,--who did not
seem to be quite so much of a gentleman;--and again, not far in the
distance Didon quickly espied a policeman, who did not at present
connect himself with the affair, but who seemed to have his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) time very
much at command, and to be quite ready if he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) were wanted. Didon at
once gave up the game,--as regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mistress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I must persist in asserting that you are Miss Melmotte,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``and that this other--person is your servant,
Elise Didon. You speak English, Miss Melmotte.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>Marie declared that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) spoke French. <div class="bookquote">``And English too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``I think you
had better make up your minds to go back to London. I will accompany
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Didon, nous sommes perdues!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Marie. Didon, plucking up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) courage for the moment, asserted the legality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own position
and of that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mistress. They had both a right to come to
Liverpool. They had both a right to get into the cab with their
luggage. Nobody had a right to stop them. They had done nothing
against the laws. Why were they to be stopped in this way? What was
it to anybody whether they called themselves Melmotte or Racine?

<p/>The gentleman understood the French oratory, but did not commit
himself to reply in the same language. <div class="bookquote">``You had better trust yourself
to me; you had indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>demanded Marie.

<p/>Then the gentleman spoke in a very low voice. <div class="bookquote">``A cheque has been
changed which you took from your father's house. No doubt your father
will pardon that when you are once with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But in order that we
may bring you back safely we can arrest you on the score of the
cheque,--if you force us to do so. We certainly shall not let you go
on board. If you will travel back to London with me, you shall be
subjected to no inconvenience which can be avoided.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was certainly no help to be found anywhere. It may be well
doubted whether upon the whole the telegraph has not added more
to the annoyances than to the comforts of life, and whether the
gentlemen who spent all the public money without authority ought not
to have been punished with special severity in that they had injured
humanity, rather than pardoned because of the good they had produced.
Who is benefited by telegrams? The newspapers are robbed of all their
old interest, and the very soul of intrigue is destroyed. Poor Marie,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) fate, would certainly have gladly hanged Mr.
Scudamore.

<p/>When the gentleman had made his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) offered no further
opposition. Looking into Didon's face and bursting into tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
sat down on one of the boxes. But Didon became very clamorous on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
own behalf,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) clamour was successful. <div class="bookquote">``Who was going to stop
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)? What had she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) done? Why should not she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) go where she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pleased? Did
anybody mean to take her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) up for stealing anybody's money? If anybody
did, that person had better look to himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew the law. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
would go where she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pleased.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) began to tug the rope of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) box as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) intended to drag it by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own force out of the
station. The gentleman looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) telegram,--looked at another
document which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) now held in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand, ready prepared, should it
be wanted. Elise Didon had been accused of nothing that brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>)
within the law. The gentleman in imperfect French suggested that
Didon had better return with her (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>) mistress. But Didon clamoured only
the more. No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>) would go to New York. She (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>) would go wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>)
pleased,--all the world over. Nobody should stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>)
addressed herself in what little English she (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>) could command to
half-a-dozen cabmen who were standing round and enjoying the scene.
They were to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>) trunk at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>) had money and she (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>) could pay.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>) started off to the nearest cab, and no one stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Didon</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But the
box in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand is mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, not forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) trinkets in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) misery. Didon surrendered the jewel-case, and ensconced herself
in the cab without a word of farewell; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) trunk was hoisted on
to the roof. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was driven away out of the station,--and out of
our story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had a first-class cabin all to herself as far as New
York, but what may have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) fate after that it matters not to us
to enquire.

<p/>Poor Marie! We who know how recreant a knight Sir Felix had proved
himself, who are aware that had Miss Melmotte succeeded in getting on
board the ship she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have passed an hour of miserable suspense,
looking everywhere for her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lover, and would then at last have been
carried to New York without him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), may congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) escape.
And, indeed, we who know his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) character better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did, may still
hope in her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) behalf that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) may be ultimately saved from so wretched
a marriage. But to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) present position was truly miserable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would have to encounter an enraged father; and when,--when should she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lover again? Poor, poor Felix! What would be his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) feelings
when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should find himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) way to New York without his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) love!
But in one matter she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind steadfastly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would be true
to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)! They might chop her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) in pieces! Yes;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had said it before,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would say it again. There was, however, doubt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind
from time to time, whether one course might not be better even than
constancy. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could contrive to throw herself out of the carriage
and to be killed,--would not that be the best termination to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
present disappointment? Would not that be the best punishment for her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
father? But how then would it be with poor Felix? <div class="bookquote">``After all I don't
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cares for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said to herself, thinking over it
all.

<p/>The gentleman was very kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), not treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) at all as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) were disgraced. As they got near town he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ventured to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) a
little advice. <div class="bookquote">``Put a good face on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and don't be cast
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother will be delighted to have you back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that mamma cares. It's papa. I'd do it again to-morrow
if I had the chance.''  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div>The gentleman looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), not having
expected so much determination. <div class="bookquote">``I would. Why is a girl to be made
to marry to please any one but herself? I won't. And it's very mean
saying that I stole the money. I always take what I want, and papa
never says anything about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two hundred and fifty pounds is a large sum, Miss Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing in our house. It isn't about the money. It's because
papa wants me to marry another man;--and I won't. It was downright
mean to send and have me taken up before all the people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't have come back if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) hadn't done that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I wouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.

<p/>The gentleman had telegraphed up to Grosvenor Square while on the
journey, and at Euston Square they were met by one of the Melmotte
carriages. Marie was to be taken home in the carriage, and the box
was to follow in a cab;--to follow at some interval so that Grosvenor
Square might not be aware of what had taken place. Grosvenor Square,
of course, very soon knew all about it. <div class="bookquote">``And are you to come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie
asked, speaking to the gentleman. The gentleman replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
been requested to see Miss Melmotte home. <div class="bookquote">``All the people will wonder
who you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie laughing. Then the gentleman thought that
Miss Melmotte would be able to get through her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) troubles without much
suffering.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) got home she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was hurried up at once to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mother's

it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, papa;--yes. You made me do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You fool you! You were going to New York,--were you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>To this she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
vouchsafed no reply. <div class="bookquote">``As if I hadn't found out all about it. Who was
going with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have found out all about it, you know, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know;--but you don't know all about it, you little
idiot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt I'm a fool and an idiot. You always say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you suppose Sir Felix Carbury is now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
eyes and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``An hour ago he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) was in bed at his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) mother's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't, don't you? You'll find it true. If you had gone to New

behind, I think I'd have let you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) didn't stay behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where is the money you took from your mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie was silent.
<div class="bookquote">``Who got the cheque changed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didon did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And has she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got the money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you give it to Sir Felix Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll be hanged if I don't prosecute him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) for stealing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) lost it at cards, and therefore didn't go

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you can do anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) didn't steal it. I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa, I won't. What's the good of promising when I should only

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the money!--What do you know about the money? Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and

held her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) very hard and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go, papa; you hurt me. I never asked for such things. I don't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only for somebody to love me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, looking down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll soon have nobody to love you, if you go on this fashion.
You've had everything done for you, and if you don't do something
for me in return, by G-- you shall have a hard time of it. If you
weren't such a fool you'd believe me when I say that I know more than
you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't know better than me what'll make me happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think only of yourself? If you'll marry Lord Nidderdale
you'll have a position in the world which nothing can take from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie firmly. Upon this he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
cried, and calling for Madame Melmotte desired his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife not to let
the girl for one minute out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presence.

<p/>The condition of Sir Felix was I think worse than that of the lady
with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to have run away. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had played at the Beargarden
till four in the morning and had then left the club, on the
breaking-up of the card-table, intoxicated and almost penniless.
During the last half hour he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had made himself very unpleasant at the
club, saying all manner of harsh things of Miles Grendall;--of whom,
indeed, it was almost impossible to say things too hard, had they
been said in a proper form and at a proper time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) declared that
Grendall would not pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) debts, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had cheated when playing
loo,--as to which Sir Felix appealed to Dolly Longestaffe; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
ended by asserting that Grendall ought to be turned out of the club.
They had a desperate row. Dolly of course had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) knew
nothing about it, and Lord Grasslough had expressed an opinion that
perhaps more than one person ought to be turned out. At four o'clock
the party was broken up and Sir Felix wandered forth into the
streets, with nothing more than the change of a ten pound note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
pocket. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) luggage was lying in the hall of the club, and there
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) left it.

<p/>There could hardly have been a more miserable wretch than Sir Felix
wandering about the streets of London that night. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was
nearly drunk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was not drunk enough to forget the condition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
affairs. There is an intoxication that makes merry in the midst of
affliction;--and there is an intoxication that banishes affliction
by producing oblivion. But again there is an intoxication which is
conscious of itself though it makes the feet unsteady, and the voice
thick, and the brain foolish; and which brings neither mirth nor
oblivion. Sir Felix trying to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) way to Welbeck Street and
losing it at every turn, feeling himself to be an object of ridicule
to every wanderer, and of dangerous suspicion to every policeman,
got no good at all out of his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) intoxication. What had he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) better do
with himself? He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) fumbled in his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) pocket, and managed to get hold of
his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) ticket for New York. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) still make the journey? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)
thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) luggage, and could not remember where it was. At last,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) steadied himself against a letter-post, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was able to call
to mind that his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) portmanteaus were at the club. By this time he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had
wandered into Marylebone Lane, but did not in the least know where
he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was. But he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) made an attempt to get back to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) club, and stumbled
half down Bond Street. Then a policeman enquired into his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) purposes,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) lived in Welbeck Street, walked back with
him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) as far as Oxford Street. Having once mentioned the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)
lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had not strength of will left to go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) purpose of
getting his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) luggage and starting for Liverpool.

<p/>Between six and seven he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was knocking at the door in Welbeck Street.
He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had tried his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) latch-key, but had found it inefficient. As he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was
supposed to be at Liverpool, the door had in fact been locked. At
last it was opened by Lady Carbury herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had fallen more than
once, and was soiled with the gutter. Most of my readers will not
probably know how a man looks when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes home drunk at six in the
morning; but they who have seen the thing will acknowledge that a
sorrier sight can not meet a mother's eye than that of a son in such
a condition. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It`sh all up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, stumbling in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened, Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Discovered, and be d-- to it! The old shap`sh stopped ush.''  (<font color='red'><b>Drunk</b></font>)</div>Drunk
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) was able to lie. At that moment the <div class="bookquote">``old shap''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>was fast
asleep in Grosvenor Square, altogether ignorant of the plot; and
Marie, joyful with excitement, was getting into the cab in the mews.
<div class="bookquote">``Bettersh go to bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) stumbled up-stairs by daylight, the
wretched mother helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) clothes for him (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>)
boots, and having left him (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) already asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went down to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own
room, a miserable woman.




<p/>CHAPTER LI.

<p/>WHICH SHALL IT BE?


<p/>Paul Montague reached London on his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) return from Suffolk early on the
Monday morning, and on the following day he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) wrote to Mrs. Hurtle. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) lodgings, thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) condition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) almost wished
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) had taken Melmotte's offer and gone to Mexico. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) might at
any rate have endeavoured to promote the railway earnestly, and then
have abandoned it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) found the whole thing false. In such case of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) would never have seen Hetta Carbury again; but, as things
were, of what use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) love,--of what use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) or to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)?
The kind of life of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) dreamed, such a life in England as was
that of Roger Carbury, or, as such life would be, if Roger had a wife
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) loved, seemed to be far beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) reach. Nobody was like
Roger Carbury! Would it not be well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should go away, and, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) went, write to Hetta and bid her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marry the best man that ever
lived in the world?

<p/>But the journey to Mexico was no longer open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
repudiated the proposition and had quarrelled with Melmotte. It was
necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should immediately take some further step in regard
to Mrs. Hurtle. Twice lately he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had gone to Islington determined that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would see that lady for the last time. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to
Lowestoft, and had been equally firm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) resolution that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would
there put an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) present bonds. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had promised to go
again to Islington;--and was aware that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) failed to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
promise, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). In this way there would never be an
end to it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would certainly go again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had promised,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should still
require it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would first try what a letter would do,--a plain
unvarnished tale. Might it still be possible that a plain tale sent
by post should have sufficient efficacy? This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) plain tale as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) now told it.


<p/>Tuesday, 2nd July, 1873.

<p/>MY DEAR MRS. HURTLE,--

<p/>I promised that I would go to you again in Islington, and
so I will, if you still require it. But I think that such
a meeting can be of no service to either of us. What is to
be gained? I do not for a moment mean to justify my own
conduct. It is not to be justified. When I met you on our
journey hither from San Francisco, I was charmed with your
genius, your beauty, and your character. They are now what
I found them to be then. But circumstances have made our
lives and temperaments so far different, that I am certain
that, were we married, we should not make each other
happy. Of course the fault was mine; but it is better to
own that fault, and to take all the blame,--and the evil
consequences, let them be what they may,--

<p/>to be shot, for instance, like the gentleman in Oregon,--

<p/>than to be married with the consciousness that even at
the very moment of the ceremony, such marriage will be
a matter of sorrow and repentance. As soon as my mind
was made up on this I wrote to you. I can not,--I dare
not,--blame you for the step you have since taken. But
I can only adhere to the resolution I then expressed.

<p/>The first day I saw you here in London you asked me
whether I was attached to another woman. I could answer
you only by the truth. But I should not of my own accord
have spoken to you of altered affections. It was after I
had resolved to break my engagement with you that I first
knew this girl. It was not because I had come to love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
that I broke it. I have no grounds whatever for hoping
that my love will lead to any results.

<p/>I have now told you as exactly as I can the condition
of my mind. If it were possible for me in any way to
compensate the injury I have done you,--or even to undergo
retribution for it,--I would do so. But what compensation
can be given, or what retribution can you exact? I think
that our further meeting can avail nothing. But if, after
this, you wish me to come again, I will come for the last
time,--because I have promised.

<p/>Your most sincere friend,

<p/>PAUL MONTAGUE.


<p/>Mrs. Hurtle, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) read this, was torn in two ways. All that Paul
had written was in accordance with the words written by herself on a
scrap of paper which she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) still kept in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own pocket. Those words,
fairly transcribed on a sheet of note-paper, would be the most
generous and the fittest answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could give. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) longed to be
generous. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had all a woman's natural desire to sacrifice herself.
But the sacrifice which would have been most to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) taste would have
been of another kind. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ruined and penniless she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
would have delighted to share with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) possessed. Had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) a cripple, or blind, or miserably struck with some
disease, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have stayed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and have nursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) and given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) comfort. Even had he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) been disgraced she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would have fled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
to some far country and have pardoned all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) faults. No sacrifice
would have been too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that would have been accompanied by
a feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) appreciated all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was doing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was loved in return. But to sacrifice herself by going away
and never more being heard of, was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)! What woman can
endure such sacrifice as that? To give up not only her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
wrath also;--that was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)! The idea of being tame was
terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life had not been very prosperous, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had dared to protect herself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own
spirit. Now, at last, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) succumb and be trodden on like a
worm? Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) be weaker even than an English girl? Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to have amused himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love, to have had <div class="bookquote">``a good
time,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and then to roam away like a bee, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was so dreadfully
scorched, so mutilated and punished! Had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) whole life been
opposed to the theory of such passive endurance? She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took out the
scrap of paper and read it; and, in spite of all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt that there
was a feminine softness in it that gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>But no;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not send it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not even copy the words.
And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) gave play to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) strongest feelings on the other
side,--being in truth torn in two directions. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat herself
down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) desk, and with rapid words, and flashing thoughts, wrote
as follows:--


<p/>PAUL MONTAGUE,--

<p/>I have suffered many injuries, but of all injuries this
is the worst and most unpardonable,--and the most unmanly.
Surely there never was such a coward, never so false a
liar. The poor wretch that I destroyed was mad with liquor
and was only acting after his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) kind. Even Caradoc Hurtle
never premeditated such wrong as this. What;--you are to
bind yourself to me by the most solemn obligation that can
join a man and a woman together, and then tell me,--when
they have affected my whole life,--that they are to go for
nothing, because they do not suit your view of things? On
thinking over it, you find that an American wife would
not make you so comfortable as some English girl;--and
therefore it is all to go for nothing! I have no brother,
no man near me;--or you would not dare to do this. You can
not but be a coward.

<p/>You talk of compensation! Do you mean money? You do not
dare to say so, but you must mean it. It is an insult
the more. But as to retribution; yes. You shall suffer
retribution. I desire you to come to me,--according to
your promise,--and you will find me with a horsewhip in my
hand. I will whip you till I have not a breath in my body.
And then I will see what you will dare to do;--whether you
will drag me into a court of law for the assault.

<p/>Yes; come. You shall come. And now you know the welcome
you shall find. I will buy the whip while this is reaching
you, and you shall find that I know how to choose such a
weapon. I call upon you to come. But should you be afraid
and break your promise, I will come to you. I will make
London too hot to hold you;--and if I do not find you I
will go with my story to every friend you have.

<p/>I have now told you as exactly as I can the condition of
my mind.

<p/>WINIFRID HURTLE.


<p/>Having written this she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) again read the short note, and again gave
way to violent tears. But on that day she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sent no letter. On the
following morning she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wrote a third, and sent that. This was the
third letter:--


<p/>Yes. Come.

<p/>W. H.


<p/>This letter duly reached Paul Montague at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lodgings. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) started
immediately for Islington. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had now no desire to delay the meeting.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had at any rate taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gentleness towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) going to the play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), and drinking tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) at Mrs.
Pipkin's, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) journey with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) to the sea, were not to be taken
as evidence that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was gradually being conquered. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had declared
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) purpose plainly enough at Lowestoft,--and plainly enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
last letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) down at the hotel, that had she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) by
chance have been armed at the moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would have shot him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
could arm herself now if she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) pleased;--but his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) real fear had not lain
in that direction. The pang consisted in having to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
was resolved to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wrong. The worst of that was now over.

<p/>The door was opened for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) by Ruby, who by no means greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with
a happy countenance. It was the second morning after the night of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
imprisonment; and nothing had occurred to alleviate her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) woe. At this
very moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover should have been in Liverpool, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was, in
fact, abed in Welbeck Street. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)'s at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby,
with a baby in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) arms and a little child hanging on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) dress.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't pull so, Sally. Please, sir, is Sir Felix still in London?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>Ruby had written to Sir Felix the very night of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) imprisonment, but
had not as yet received any reply. Paul, whose mind was altogether
intent on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own troubles, declared that at present he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knew nothing
about Sir Felix, and was then shown into Mrs. Hurtle's room.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: The door was opened for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) by Ruby.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) said, without rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I came, when you desired it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why you should. My wishes do not seem to affect you
much. Will you sit down there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) said, pointing to a seat at some
distance from herself. <div class="bookquote">``So you think it would be best that you and I
should never see each other again?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was very calm; but it seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) that the quietness was assumed, and that at any moment it
might be converted into violence. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) thought that there was that in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) eye which seemed to foretell the spring of the wild-cat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did think so certainly. What more can I say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing; clearly nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) voice was very low. <div class="bookquote">``Why should a
gentleman trouble himself to say any more,--than that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has changed
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind? Why make a fuss about such little things as a woman's
life, or a woman's heart?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``And having come, in
consequence of my unreasonable request, of course you are wise to
hold your peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I came because I promised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you did not promise to speak;--did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you have me say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ah what! Am I to be so weak as to tell you now what I would have
you say? Suppose you were to say, ``I am a gentleman, and a man of my
word, and I repent me of my intended perfidy,<div class="bookquote">'' do you not think you
might get your release that way? Might it not be possible that I
should reply that as your heart was gone from me, your hand might
go after it;--that I scorned to be the wife of a man who did not
want me?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked this she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gradually raised her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) voice, and half
lifted herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seat, stretching herself towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, not well knowing what to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I should not. I at least will be true. I should take you,
Paul,--still take you; with a confidence that I should yet win you
to me by my devotion. I have still some kindness of feeling towards
you,--none to that woman who is I suppose younger than I, and
gentler, and a maid.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) still looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) expected a
reply, but there was nothing to be said in answer to this. <div class="bookquote">``Now that
you are going to leave me, Paul, is there any advice you can give me,
as to what I shall do next? I have given up every friend in the world
for you. I have no home. Mrs. Pipkin's room here is more my home than
any other spot on the earth. I have all the world to choose from, but
no reason whatever for a choice. I have my property. What shall I do
with it, Paul? If I could die and be no more heard of, you should
be welcome to it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was no answer possible to all this. The
questions were asked because there was no answer possible. <div class="bookquote">``You might
at any rate advise me. Paul, you are in some degree responsible,--are
you not,--for my loneliness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am. But you know that I cannot answer your questions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot wonder that I should be somewhat in doubt as to my future
life. As far as I can see, I had better remain here. I do good at any
rate to Mrs. Pipkin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) went into hysterics yesterday when I spoke
of leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>). That woman, Paul, would starve in our country, and I
shall be desolate in this.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) paused, and there was absolute
silence for a minute. <div class="bookquote">``You thought my letter very short; did you
not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It said, I suppose, all you had to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. I did have much more to say. That was the third letter
I wrote. Now you shall see the other two. I wrote three, and had to
choose which I would send you. I fancy that yours to me was easier
written than either one of mine. You had no doubts, you know. I had
many doubts. I could not send them all by post, together. But you may
see them all now. There is one. You may read that first. While I was
writing it, I was determined that that should go.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) handed
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the sheet of paper which contained the threat of the horsewhip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you did not send that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have changed your mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything in it that seems to you to be unreasonable? Speak
out and tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thinking of you, not of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of me, then. Is there anything said there which the usage to
which I have been subjected does not justify?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ask me questions which I cannot answer. I do not think that
under any provocation a woman should use a horsewhip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is certainly more comfortable for gentlemen,--who amuse
themselves,--that women should have that opinion. But, upon my word,
I don't know what to say about that. As long as there are men to
fight for women, it may be well to leave the fighting to the men.
But when a woman has no one to help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to bear everything
without turning upon those who ill-use her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? Shall a woman be flayed
alive because it is unfeminine in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to fight for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own skin?
What is the good of being--feminine, as you call it? Have you asked
yourself that? That men may be attracted, I should say. But if a
woman finds that men only take advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) assumed weakness,
shall she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not throw it off? If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be treated as prey, shall she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not
fight as a beast of prey? Oh, no;--it is so unfeminine! I also, Paul,
had thought of that. The charm of womanly weakness presented itself
to my mind in a soft moment,--and then I wrote this other letter. You
may as well see them all.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the scrap which had
been written at Lowestoft, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read that also.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly finish it, because of the tears which filled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eyes. But, having mastered its contents, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came across the room and
threw himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feet, sobbing. <div class="bookquote">``I have not sent it,
you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I only show it you that you may see how my mind
has been at work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It hurts me more than the other,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I would not hurt you,--not at this moment. Sometimes I feel
that I could tear you limb from limb, so great is my disappointment,
so ungovernable my rage! Why,--why should I be such a victim? Why
should life be an utter blank to me, while you have everything before
you? There, you have seen them all. Which will you have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot now take that other as the expression of your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it will be when you have left me;--and was when you were with me
at the sea-side. And it was so I felt when I got your first letter in
San Francisco. Why should you kneel there? You do not love me. A man
should kneel to a woman for love, not for pardon.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
spoke thus, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, and pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hair, and looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether that other woman
loves you. I do not want an answer, Paul. I suppose you had better
go.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and pressed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breast. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me one
thing. When you spoke of--compensation, did you mean--money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; indeed no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not;--I hope not that. Well, there;--go. You shall be
troubled no more with Winifrid Hurtle.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took the sheet of paper
which contained the threat of the horsewhip and tore it into scraps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I to keep the other?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. For what purpose would you have it? To prove my weakness? That
also shall be destroyed.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took it and restored it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
pocket-book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay! This parting will not bear a farewell. Go, and let there be no
other word spoken.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went.

<p/>As soon as the front door was closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rang the bell and
begged Ruby to ask Mrs. Pipkin to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Pipkin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
said, as soon as the woman had entered the room; <div class="bookquote">``everything is over
between me and Mr. Montague.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was standing upright in the middle
of the room, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke there was a smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord a' mercy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin, holding up both her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I have told you that I was to be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), I think it right
now to tell you that I'm not going to be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why not?--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) such a nice young man,--and quiet too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the why not, I don't know that I am prepared to speak about
that. But it is so. I was engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm well sure of that, Mrs. Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I'm no longer engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearie me! and you going down to Lowestoft with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Pipkin could not bear to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) should hear no more of such
an interesting story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We did go down to Lowestoft together, and we both came back,--not
together. And there's an end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure it's not your fault, Mrs. Hurtle. When a marriage is to be,
and doesn't come off, it never is the lady's fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's an end of it, Mrs. Pipkin. If you please, we won't say
anything more about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you going to leave, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin, prepared to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) apron up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) eyes at a moment's notice. Where should she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
get such another lodger as Mrs. Hurtle,--a lady who not only did
not inquire about victuals, but who was always suggesting that the
children should eat this pudding or finish that pie, and who had
never questioned an item in a bill since she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had been in the house!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll say nothing about that yet, Mrs. Pipkin.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>Then Mrs. Pipkin
gave utterance to so many assurances of sympathy and help that it
almost seemed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was prepared to guarantee to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) lodger
another lover in lieu of the one who was now dismissed.




<p/>CHAPTER LII.

<p/>THE RESULTS OF LOVE AND WINE.


<p/>Two, three, four, and even five o'clock still found Sir Felix Carbury
in bed on that fatal Thursday. More than once or twice his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mother
crept up to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) room, but on each occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) feigned to be fast
asleep and made no reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gentle words. But his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) condition was
one which only admits of short snatches of uneasy slumber. From head
to foot, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was sick and ill and sore, and could find no comfort
anywhere. To lie where he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was, trying by absolute quiescence to
soothe the agony of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) brows and to remember that as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lay
there he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would be safe from attack by the outer world, was all the
solace within his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) reach. Lady Carbury sent the page up to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), and to
the page he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was awake. The boy brought him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) tea. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) asked for soda and
brandy; but there was none to be had, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) present condition he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
did not dare to hector about it till it was procured for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>).

<p/>The world surely was now all over to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had made arrangements
for running away with the great heiress of the day, and had
absolutely allowed the young lady to run away without him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). The
details of their arrangement had been such that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) absolutely would
start upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) long journey across the ocean before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could find
out that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had failed to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) appointment. Melmotte's hostility
would be incurred by the attempt, and hers by the failure. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
had lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) money,--and hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had induced his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) poor mother to
assist in raising a fund for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>),--and even that was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was so
cowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was afraid even of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mother. And he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could remember
something, but no details, of some row at the club,--but still with a
conviction on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had made the row. Ah,--when would he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
summon courage to enter the club again? When could he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) show himself
again anywhere? All the world would know that Marie Melmotte had
attempted to run off with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), and that at the last moment he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had
failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). What lie could he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) invent to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) disgrace? And his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
clothes! All his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) things were at the club;--or he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) thought that they
were, not being quite certain whether he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had not made some attempt to
carry them off to the Railway Station. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had heard of suicide. If
ever it could be well that a man should cut his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own throat, surely
the time had come for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now. But as this idea presented itself to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply gathered the clothes around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and tried to sleep. The
death of Cato would hardly have for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) persuasive charms.

<p/>Between five and six his (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) mother again came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>)
appeared to sleep, stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) shoulder. There
must be some end to this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) must at any rate be fed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), wretched
woman, had been sitting all day,--thinking of it. As regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son
himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) condition told his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) story with sufficient accuracy. What
might be the fate of the girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not stop to enquire. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
not heard all the details of the proposed scheme; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had known
that Felix had proposed to be at Liverpool on the Wednesday night,
and to start on Thursday for New York with the young lady; and with
the view of aiding him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) object she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with money.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had bought clothes for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and had been busy with Hetta for two
days preparing for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) long journey,--having told some lie to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own
daughter as to the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother's intended journey. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had
not gone, but had come, drunk and degraded, back to the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had searched his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pockets with less scruple than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had ever before
felt, and had found his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ticket for the vessel and the few sovereigns
which were left to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). About him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could read the riddle plainly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had stayed at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) club till he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was drunk, and had gambled away all
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) money. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had first seen him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had asked herself what
further lie she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should now tell to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter. At breakfast there
was instant need for some story. <div class="bookquote">``Mary says that Felix came back this
morning, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) has not gone at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta exclaimed. The poor
woman could not bring herself to expose the vices of the son to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had stumbled into the house drunk
at six o'clock. Hetta no doubt had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own suspicions. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) has
come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, broken-hearted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) troubles. <div class="bookquote">``It
was some plan about the Mexican railway I believe, and has broken
through. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) is very unhappy and not well. I will see to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>After
that Hetta had said nothing during the whole day. And now, about an
hour before dinner, Lady Carbury was standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son's bedside,
determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``speak to me, Felix.--I know that you are awake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) groaned, and turned himself away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), burying himself,
further under the bedclothes. <div class="bookquote">``You must get up for your dinner. It is
near six o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the meaning of this, Felix? You must tell me. It must be
told sooner or later. I know you are unhappy. You had better trust
your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sick, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be better up. What were you doing last night? What has come
of it all? Where are your things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the club.--You had better leave me now, and let Sam come up to
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>Sam was the page.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will leave you presently; but, Felix, you must tell me about this.
What has been done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It hasn't come off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how has it not come off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't get away. What's the good of asking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said this morning when you came in, that Mr. Melmotte had
discovered it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I? Then I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has. Oh, mother, I wish I could die. I
don't see what's the use of anything. I won't get up to dinner. I'd
rather stay here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have something to eat, Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sam can bring it me. Do let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) get me some brandy and water. I'm so
faint and sick with all this that I can hardly bear myself. I can't
talk now. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'ll get me a bottle of soda water and some brandy,
I'll tell you all about it then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the money, Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I paid it for the ticket,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) hands up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
head.

<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mother again left him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) with the understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was to
be allowed to remain in bed till the next morning; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) some further explanation when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had been refreshed and
invigorated after his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own prescription. The boy went out and got him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
soda water and brandy, and meat was carried up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
did succeed for a while in finding oblivion from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) misery in sleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) ill, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you not better send for a doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will be better to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I think you would be happier if you would tell me
everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, bursting out into tears. <div class="bookquote">``Don't ask.
What's the good of asking? It is all misery and wretchedness. There
is nothing to tell,--except that I am ruined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) done anything, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. What should he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) have done? How am I to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) does? He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)

better it would be to be childless!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, do you mean me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, rushing across the room, and
throwing herself close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother's side on the sofa. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma, say
that you do not mean me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It concerns you as well as me and him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I wish I were childless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, do not be cruel to me! Am I not good to you? Do I not try
to be a comfort to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then marry your cousin, Roger Carbury, who is a good man, and who
can protect you. You can, at any rate, find a home for yourself, and
a friend for us. You are not like Felix. You do not get drunk and
gamble,--because you are a woman. But you are stiff-necked, and will
not help me in my trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I marry him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), mamma, without loving him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love! Have I been able to love? Do you see much of what you call
love around you? Why should you not love him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is a gentleman, and
a good man,--soft-hearted, of a sweet nature, whose life would be one
effort to make yours happy. You think that Felix is very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But ask yourself whether you do not give as much pain, seeing what
you could do for us if you would. But it never occurs to you to
sacrifice even a fantasy for the advantage of others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta retired from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) seat on the sofa, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother again
went up-stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) turned it all over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind. Could it be right
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should marry one man when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) loved another? Could it be
right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should marry at all, for the sake of doing good to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) family? This man, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might marry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would,--who did
in truth worship the ground on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) trod,--was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) well knew,
all that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother had said. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was more than that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother
had spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soft heart, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sweet nature. But Hetta knew
also that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man of high honour and a noble courage. In such
a condition as was hers now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the very friend whose advice she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
could have asked,--had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not been the very lover who was desirous
of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. Hetta felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could sacrifice much for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother. Money, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could have given, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
left herself penniless. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) time, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) inclinations, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) very heart's
treasure, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could give. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could
doom herself to poverty, and loneliness, and heart-rending regrets
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother's sake. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could give
herself into the arms of a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not love.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Can I marry the man I do not love?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what there is to explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not gone to Liverpool, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
been interrupted by Melmotte himself, whether news had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
from Marie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been stopped, or whether,--as might have been
possible,--Marie had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own mind. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not bring
himself to tell the truth, or any story bordering on the truth. <div class="bookquote">``It
didn't come off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and of course that knocked me off my
legs. Well; yes. I did take some champagne when I found how it was. A
fellow does get cut up by that kind of thing. Oh, I heard it at the
club,--that the whole thing was off. I can't explain anything more.
And then I was so mad, I can't tell what I was after. I did get the
ticket. There it is. That shows I was in earnest. I spent the #30
in getting it. I suppose the change is there. Don't take it, for I
haven't another shilling in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said nothing
of Marie's money, or of that which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had himself received from
Melmotte. And as his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mother had heard nothing of these sums she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could
not contradict what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got from him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) no further statement,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sure that there was a story to be told which would reach
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ears sooner or later.

<p/>That evening, about nine o'clock, Mr. Broune called in Welbeck
Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) very often did call now, coming up in a cab, staying for
a cup of tea, and going back in the same cab to the office of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
newspaper. Since Lady Carbury had, so devotedly, abstained from
accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) offer, Mr. Broune had become almost sincerely attached
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). There was certainly between them now more of the intimacy of
real friendship than had ever existed in earlier days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) spoke to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) more freely about his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) own affairs, and even she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would speak to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) with some attempt at truth. There was never between them now even
a shade of love-making. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not look into his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) eyes, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand. As for kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) thought no more of it than
of kissing the maid-servant. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) of the things that
worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>),--the unreasonable exactions of proprietors, and the
perilous inaccuracy of contributors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) of the exceeding
weight upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) shoulders, under which an Atlas would have succumbed.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) something too of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) triumphs;--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had had this
fellow bowled over in punishment for some contradiction, and that man
snuffed out for daring to be an enemy. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expatiated on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
virtues, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) justice and clemency. Ah,--if men and women only knew
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good nature and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patriotism;--how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spared the rod here,
how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made the fortune of a man there, how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had saved the
country millions by the steadiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adherence to some grand
truth! Lady Carbury delighted in all this and repaid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by flattery,
and little confidences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own. Under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teaching she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had almost
made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind to give up Mr. Alf. Of nothing was Mr. Broune more
certain than that Mr. Alf was making a fool of himself in regard to
the Westminster election and those attacks on Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``The world of
London generally knows what it is about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune, <div class="bookquote">``and the
London world believes Mr. Melmotte to be sound. I don't pretend to
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has never done anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ought not to do. I am not
going into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) antecedents. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is a man of wealth, power, and
genius, and Alf will get the worst of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>Under such teaching as
this, Lady Carbury was almost obliged to give up Mr. Alf.

<p/>Sometimes they would sit in the front room with Hetta, to whom also
Mr. Broune had become attached; but sometimes Lady Carbury would be
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own sanctum. On this evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) there, and at
once poured forth all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) troubles about Felix. On this occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) everything, and almost told him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) everything truly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had
already heard the story. <div class="bookquote">``The young lady went down to Liverpool, and
Sir Felix was not there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) could not have been there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) has been in bed in this house all
day. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I am told;--and was met at the station by the senior officer
of the police at Liverpool, who brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) back to London without
letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) go down to the ship at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) must have thought that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) lover was on board;--probably thinks so now. I pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much worse it would have been, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) been allowed to start,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that would have been bad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would have had a sad journey to
New York, and a sadder journey back. Has your son told you anything
about money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say that the girl entrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with a large sum which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father. If that be so he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) certainly ought to lose no
time in restoring it. It might be done through some friend. I would
do it for that matter. If it be so,--to avoid unpleasantness,--it
should be sent back at once. It will be for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) credit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>This Mr.
Broune said with a clear intimation of the importance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) advice.

<p/>It was dreadful to Lady Carbury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had no money to give back, nor,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was well aware, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had heard nothing of any
money. What did Mr. Broune mean by a large sum? <div class="bookquote">``That would be
dreadful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you not better ask him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Carbury was again in tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not hope to
get a word of truth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by a large sum?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two or three hundred pounds, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not a shilling in the world, Mr. Broune.''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>Then it all came
out,--the whole story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) poverty, as it had been brought about by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son's misconduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) every detail of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) money affairs
from the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) husband, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will, up to the present
moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) is eating you up, Lady Carbury.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was nearly eaten up already, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``You must put a
stop to this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must rid yourself of him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). It is dreadful to say so, but it must
be done. You must not see your daughter ruined. Find out what money
he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) got from Miss Melmotte and I will see that it is repaid. That
must be done;--and we will then try to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) to go abroad. No;--do
not contradict me. We can talk of the money another time. I must be
off now, as I have stayed too long. Do as I bid you. Make him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) tell
you, and send me word down to the office. If you could do it early
to-morrow, that would be best. God bless you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hurried off.

<p/>Early on the following morning a letter from Lady Carbury was put
into Mr. Broune's hands, giving the story of the money as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had been able to extract it from Sir Felix. Sir Felix declared that
Mr. Melmotte had owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) #600, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had received #250 out of
this from Miss Melmotte,--so that there was still a large balance
due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Lady Carbury went on to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son had at last
confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had lost this money at play. The story was fairly
true; but Lady Carbury in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) letter acknowledged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was not
justified in believing it because it was told to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son.




<p/>CHAPTER LIII.

<p/>A DAY IN THE CITY.


<p/>Melmotte had got back his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) daughter, and was half inclined to let the
matter rest there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would probably have done so had he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) not known
that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own household were aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had gone off to meet
Sir Felix Carbury, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) not also received the condolence of
certain friends in the city. It seemed that about two o'clock in the
day the matter was known to everybody. Of course Lord Nidderdale
would hear of it, and if so all the trouble that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had taken in
that direction would have been taken in vain. Stupid fool of a girl
to throw away her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chance,--nay, to throw away the certainty of a
brilliant career, in that way! But his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) anger against Sir Felix was
infinitely more bitter than his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) anger against his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) daughter. The man
had pledged himself to abstain from any step of this kind,--had
given a written pledge,--had renounced under his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own signature his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
intention of marrying Marie! Melmotte had of course learned all the
details of the cheque for #250,--how the money had been paid at the
bank to Didon, and how Didon had given it to Sir Felix. Marie herself
acknowledged that Sir Felix had received the money. If possible he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would prosecute the baronet for stealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) money.

<p/>Had Melmotte been altogether a prudent man he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would probably have
been satisfied with getting back his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) daughter and would have allowed
the money to go without further trouble. At this especial point in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) career ready money was very valuable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) concerns
were of such magnitude that #250 could make but little difference.
But there had grown upon the man during the last few months an
arrogance, a self-confidence inspired in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the worship of other
men, which clouded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intellect, and robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of much of that
power of calculation which undoubtedly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) naturally possessed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
remembered perfectly his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) various little transactions with Sir Felix.
Indeed it was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gifts to remember with accuracy all money
transactions, whether great or small, and to keep an account book in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, which was always totted up and balanced with accuracy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knew exactly how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood, even with the crossing-sweeper to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given a penny last Tuesday, as with the Longestaffes, father
and son, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had not as yet made any payment on behalf of the
purchase of Pickering. But Sir Felix's money had been consigned into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) hands for the purchase of shares,--and that consignment did not
justify Sir Felix in taking another sum of money from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) daughter.
In such a matter he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) thought that an English magistrate, and an
English jury, would all be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) side,--especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) was
Augustus Melmotte, the man about to be chosen for Westminster, the
man about to entertain the Emperor of China!

<p/>The next day was Friday,--the day of the Railway Board. Early in the
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) sent a note to Lord Nidderdale.


<p/>MY DEAR NIDDERDALE,--

<p/>Pray come to the Board to-day;--or at any rate come to me
in the city. I specially want to speak to you.

<p/>Yours,

<p/>A. M.


<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) wrote, having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) mind that it would be wise to make
a clear breast of it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) hoped-for son-in-law. If there was
still a chance of keeping the young lord to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) guns that chance
would be best supported by perfect openness on his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) part. The young
lord would of course know what Marie had done. But the young lord had
for some weeks past been aware that there had been a difficulty in
regard to Sir Felix Carbury, and had not on that account relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
suit. It might be possible to persuade the young lord that as the
young lady had now tried to elope and tried in vain, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own chance
might on the whole be rather improved than injured.

<p/>Mr. Melmotte on that morning had many visitors, among whom one of the
earliest and most unfortunate was Mr. Longestaffe. At that time there
had been arranged at the offices in Abchurch Lane a mode of double
ingress and egress,--a front stairs and a back stairs approach and
exit, as is always necessary with very great men,--in reference
to which arrangement the honour and dignity attached to each is
exactly contrary to that which generally prevails in the world; the
front stairs being intended for everybody, and being both slow and
uncertain, whereas the back stairs are quick and sure, and are used
only for those who are favoured. Miles Grendall had the command of
the stairs, and found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had plenty to do in keeping people
in their right courses. Mr. Longestaffe reached Abchurch Lane
before one,--having altogether failed in getting a moment's private
conversation with the big man on that other Friday, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come
later. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell at once into Miles's hands, and was ushered through
the front stairs passage and into the front stairs waiting-room,
with much external courtesy. Miles Grendall was very voluble. Did
Mr. Longestaffe want to see Mr. Melmotte? Oh;--Mr. Longestaffe wanted
to see Mr. Melmotte as soon as possible! Of course Mr. Longestaffe
should see Mr. Melmotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>), Miles, knew that Mr. Melmotte was
particularly desirous of seeing Mr. Longestaffe. Mr. Melmotte had
mentioned Mr. Longestaffe's name twice during the last three days.
Would Mr. Longestaffe sit down for a few minutes? Had Mr. Longestaffe
seen the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>? Mr. Melmotte undoubtedly was
very much engaged. At this moment a deputation from the Canadian
Government was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>);--and Sir Gregory Gribe was in the office
waiting for a few words. But Miles thought that the Canadian
Government would not be long,--and as for Sir Gregory, perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>)
business might be postponed. Miles would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) very best to get an
interview for Mr. Longestaffe,--more especially as Mr. Melmotte was
so very desirous himself of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) friend. It was astonishing
that such a one as Miles Grendall should have learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) business
so well and should have made himself so handy! We will leave Mr.
Longestaffe with the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) hands, in the
front waiting-room, merely notifying the fact that there he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) remained
for something over two hours.

<p/>In the mean time both Mr. Broune and Lord Nidderdale came to the
office, and both were received without delay. Mr. Broune was the
first. Miles knew who he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was, and made no attempt to seat him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) in the
same room with Mr. Longestaffe. <div class="bookquote">``I'll just send him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a note,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Broune, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) scrawled a few words at the office counter. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
commissioned to pay you some money on behalf of Miss Melmotte.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Those were the words, and they at once procured him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) admission to
the sanctum. The Canadian Deputation must have taken its leave, and
Sir Gregory could hardly have as yet arrived. Lord Nidderdale, who
had presented himself almost at the same moment with the Editor,
was shown into a little private room,--which was, indeed, Miles
Grendall's own retreat. <div class="bookquote">``What's up with the Governor?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>asked the
young lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything particular do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles. <div class="bookquote">``There are always so
many things up here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) has sent for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes,--you'll go in directly. There's that fellow who does the
<div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table' in with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s come about. You
know what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has sent for you for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Nidderdale answered this question by another. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose all
this about Miss Melmotte is true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did go off yesterday morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles, in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Carbury wasn't with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no;--I suppose not. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seems to have mulled it. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s such a
d-- brute, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d be sure to go wrong whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had in hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), of course, Miles. For that matter I've no reason
to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) couldn't have gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) staggered out of the club
yesterday morning at four o'clock as drunk as Cloe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)'d lost a pot
of money, and had been kicking up a row about you for the last hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brute!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miles, with honest indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say. But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brute</b></font>) was able to make a row, I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Brute</b></font>)
couldn't get himself down to Liverpool. And I saw all his (<font color='blue'><b>Brute</b></font>) things
lying about the club hall late last night;--no end of portmanteaux
and bags; just what a fellow would take to New York. By George! Fancy
taking a girl to New York! It was plucky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles, who was of course intimate with
Mr. Melmotte's whole establishment, and had had means therefore of
hearing the true story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fiasco!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>said the young lord, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what the old boy
means to say to me about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>Then there was heard the clear tingle
of a little silver bell, and Miles told Lord Nidderdale that his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) time
had come.

<p/>Mr. Broune had of late been very serviceable to Mr. Melmotte, and
Melmotte was correspondingly gracious. On seeing the Editor he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
immediately began to make a speech of thanks in respect of the
support given by the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) candidature. But Mr.
Broune cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) short. ``I never talk about the ``Breakfast Table,'''
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). ``We endeavour to get along as right as we can, and the less
said the soonest mended.'' Melmotte bowed. <div class="bookquote">``I have come now about
quite another matter, and perhaps, the less said the sooner mended
about that also. Sir Felix Carbury on a late occasion received a sum
of money in trust from your daughter. Circumstances have prevented
its use in the intended manner, and, therefore, as Sir Felix's
friend, I have called to return the money to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mr. Broune did not
like calling himself the friend of Sir Felix, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) did even that
for the lady who had been good enough to him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) not to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte, with a scowl on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would have repressed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt you understand all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I understand. D-- scoundrel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We won't discuss that, Mr. Melmotte. I've drawn a cheque myself,
payable to your order,--to make the matter all straight. The sum was
#250, I think.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Broune put a cheque for that amount down upon
the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``But, remember, I
don't think that this absolves him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has been a scoundrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has paid back the money, which chance put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
hands, to the only person entitled to receive it on the young lady's
behalf. Good morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Mr. Melmotte did put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand in token of
amity. Then Mr. Broune departed and Melmotte tinkled his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bell. As
Nidderdale was shown in he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) crumpled up the cheque, and put it into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was at once clever enough to perceive that any idea
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might have had of prosecuting Sir Felix must be abandoned.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, my Lord, and how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pleasantest smile.
Nidderdale declared himself to be as fresh as paint. <div class="bookquote">``You don't look
down in the mouth, my Lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Lord Nidderdale,--who no doubt felt that it behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) to show
a good face before his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) late intended father-in-law,--sang the refrain
of an old song, which it is trusted my readers may remember.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cheer up, Sam;
Don't let your spirits go down.
There's many a girl that I know well,
Is waiting for you in the town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, ha,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>laughed Melmotte, <div class="bookquote">``very good. I've no doubt there
is,--many a one. But you won't let this stupid nonsense stand in your
way with Marie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, sir, I don't know about that. Miss Melmotte has given
the most convincing proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) partiality for another gentleman,
and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) indifference to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A foolish baggage! A silly little romantic baggage! She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s been
reading novels till she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has learned to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) couldn't settle down
quietly till she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had run off with somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) doesn't seem to have succeeded on this occasion, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--of course we had her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) back again from Liverpool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) got further than the gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a dishonest, drunken scoundrel. My girl knows very well what
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is now. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll never try that game again. Of course, my Lord, I'm
very sorry. You know that I've been on the square with you always.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s my only child, and sooner or later she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must have all that I
possess. What she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will have at once will make any man wealthy,--that
is, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marries with my sanction; and in a year or two I expect
that I shall be able to double what I give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now, without touching
my capital. Of course you understand that I desire to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
occupying high rank. I think that, in this country, that is a noble
object of ambition. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) married that sweep I should have broken
my heart. Now, my Lord, I want you to say that this shall make no
difference to you. I am very honest with you. I do not try to hide
anything. The thing of course has been a misfortune. Girls will be
romantic. But you may be sure that this little accident will assist
rather than impede your views. After this she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will not be very fond
of Sir Felix Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not. Though, by Jove, girls will forgive anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) won't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). By George, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) shan't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) shall hear the
whole story. You'll come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) just the same as ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? You're not so weak as to surrender all your settled
projects for such a piece of folly as that! He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) didn't even see her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That wasn't her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The money will all be there, Lord Nidderdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The money's all right, I've no doubt. And there isn't a man in all
London would be better pleased to settle down with a good income than
I would. But, by Jove, it's a rather strong order when a girl has
just run away with another man. Everybody knows it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In three months' time everybody will have forgotten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell you the truth, sir, I think Miss Melmotte has got a will of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own stronger than you give her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) credit for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has never given me
the slightest encouragement. Ever so long ago, about Christmas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
did once say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would do as you bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is very much
changed since then. The thing was off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had nothing to do with that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has taken advantage of it, and I have no right to
complain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You just come to the house, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) again to-morrow. Or come
on Sunday morning. Don't let us be done out of all our settled
arrangements by the folly of an idle girl. Will you come on Sunday
morning about noon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Lord Nidderdale thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) position for
a few moments and then said that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would come on Sunday
morning. After that Melmotte proposed that they two should go
and <div class="bookquote">``get a bit of lunch''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>at a certain Conservative club in the
City. There would be time before the meeting of the Railway Board.
Nidderdale had no objection to the lunch, but expressed a strong
opinion that the Board was <div class="bookquote">``rot.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's all very well for you,
young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chairman</b></font>)</div>said the chairman, <div class="bookquote">``but I must go there in order that you
may be able to enjoy a splendid fortune.''  (<font color='red'><b>the chairman</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) touched the young
man on the shoulder and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) back as he (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) was passing out by the
front stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Come this way, Nidderdale;--come this way. I must get
out without being seen. There are people waiting for me there who
think that a man can attend to business from morning to night without
ever having a bit in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And so they escaped by the back
stairs.

<p/>At the club, the City Conservative world,--which always lunches
well,--welcomed Mr. Melmotte very warmly. The election was coming on,
and there was much to be said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) played the part of the big City man
to perfection, standing about the room with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat on, and talking
loudly to a dozen men at once. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was glad to show the club
that Lord Nidderdale had come there with him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). The club of course
knew that Lord Nidderdale was the accepted suitor of the rich man's
daughter,--accepted, that is, by the rich man himself,--and the
club knew also that the rich man's daughter had tried,--but had
failed,--to run away with Sir Felix Carbury. There is nothing like
wiping out a misfortune and having done with it. The presence of Lord
Nidderdale was almost an assurance to the club that the misfortune
had been wiped out, and, as it were, abolished. A little before three
Mr. Melmotte returned to Abchurch Lane, intending to regain his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) room
by the back way; while Lord Nidderdale went westward, considering
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) own mind whether it was expedient that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) should continue
to show himself as a suitor for Miss Melmotte's hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had an idea
that a few years ago a man could not have done such a thing--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be held to show a poor spirit should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attempt it; but
that now it did not much matter what a man did,--if only he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were
successful. <div class="bookquote">``After all it's only an affair of money,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to
himself.

<p/>Mr. Longestaffe in the meantime had progressed from weariness to
impatience, from impatience to ill-humour, and from ill-humour to
indignation. More than once he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) saw Miles Grendall, but Miles Grendall
was always ready with an answer. That Canadian Deputation was
determined to settle the whole business this morning, and would not
take itself away. And Sir Gregory Gribe had been obstinate, beyond
the ordinary obstinacy of a bank director. The rate of discount at
the bank could not be settled for to-morrow without communication
with Mr. Melmotte, and that was a matter on which the details were
always most oppressive. At first Mr. Longestaffe was somewhat stunned
by the Deputation and Sir Gregory Gribe; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gribe</b></font>) waxed wroth
the potency of those institutions dwindled away, and as, at last,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gribe</b></font>) waxed hungry, they became as nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gribe</b></font>). Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gribe</b></font>) not Mr.
Longestaffe of Caversham, a Deputy-Lieutenant of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) County, and
accustomed to lunch punctually at two o'clock? When he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been in
that waiting-room for two hours, it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) only
wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would not remain there to be starved for
any Mr. Melmotte in Europe. It occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) also that that thorn
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) side, Squercum, would certainly get a finger into the pie to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) infinite annoyance. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) walked forth, and attempted to see
Grendall for the fourth time. But Miles Grendall also liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
lunch, and was therefore declared by one of the junior clerks to be
engaged at that moment on most important business with Mr. Melmotte.
<div class="bookquote">``Then say that I can't wait any longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe,
stamping out of the room with angry feet.

<p/>At the very door he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) met Mr. Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Mr. Longestaffe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the financier</b></font>)</div>said the
great financier, seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) by the hand, <div class="bookquote">``you are the very man I am
desirous of seeing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been waiting two hours up in your place,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire of
Caversham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut, tut;--and they never told me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I spoke to Mr. Grendall half a dozen times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--yes. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) did put a slip with your name on it on my desk.
I do remember. My dear sir, I have so many things on my brain, that
I hardly know how to get along with them. You are coming to the
Board? It's just the time now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>--said Mr. Longestaffe. <div class="bookquote">``I can stay no longer in the City.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>It
was cruel that a man so hungry should be asked to go to a Board by a
chairman who had just lunched at his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) club.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was carried away to the Bank of England and could not help
myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``And when they get me there I can never get
away again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My son is very anxious to have the payments made about Pickering,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe, absolutely holding Melmotte by the collar of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Payments for Pickering!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, assuming an air of
unimportant doubt,--of doubt as though the thing were of no real
moment. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't they been made?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe, <div class="bookquote">``unless made this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was something about it, but I cannot just remember what. My
second cashier, Mr. Smith, manages all my private affairs, and they
go clean out of my head. I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)'s in Grosvenor Square at this
moment. Let me see;--Pickering! Wasn't there some question of a
mortgage? I'm sure there was something about a mortgage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a mortgage, of course;--but that only made three payments
necessary instead of two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there was some unavoidable delay about the papers;--something
occasioned by the mortgagee. I know there was. But you shan't be
inconvenienced, Mr. Longestaffe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my son, Mr. Melmotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s got a lawyer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knew a young man that wasn't in a hurry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said
Melmotte laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes;--there were three payments to be made;
one to you, one to your son, and one to the mortgagee. I will speak
to Mr. Smith myself to-morrow--and you may tell your son that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
really need not trouble his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) lawyer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) will only be losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) money,
for lawyers are expensive. What; you won't come to the Board? I am
sorry for that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Mr. Longestaffe, having after a fashion said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
had to say, declined to go to the Board. A painful rumour had reached
him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) the day before, which had been communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) in a very
quiet way by a very old friend,--by a member of a private firm of
bankers whom he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was accustomed to regard as the wisest and most
eminent man of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) acquaintance,--that Pickering had been already
mortgaged to its full value by its new owner. <div class="bookquote">``Mind, I know nothing,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div>said the banker. <div class="bookquote">``The report has reached me, and if it be true, it
shows that Mr. Melmotte must be much pressed for money. It does
not concern you at all if you have got your price. But it seems to
be rather a quick transaction. I suppose you have, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wouldn't
have the title-deeds.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Mr. Longestaffe thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) friend, and
acknowledged that there had been something remiss on his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) part.
Therefore, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) went westward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was low in spirits. But
nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been reassured by Melmotte's manner.

<p/>Sir Felix Carbury of course did not attend the Board; nor did Paul
Montague, for reasons with which the reader has been made acquainted.
Lord Nidderdale had declined, having had enough of the City for that
day, and Mr. Longestaffe had been banished by hunger. The chairman
was therefore supported only by Lord Alfred and Mr. Cohenlupe. But
they were such excellent colleagues that the work was got through as
well as though those absentees had all attended. When the Board was
over Mr. Melmotte and Mr. Cohenlupe retired together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must get that money for Longestaffe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, eighty thousand pounds! You can't do it this week,--nor yet
before this day week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't eighty thousand pounds. I've renewed the mortgage, and that
makes it only fifty. If I can manage the half of that which goes to
the son, I can put the father off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must raise what you can on the whole property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've done that already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte hoarsely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where's the money gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brehgert has had #40,000. I was obliged to keep it up with them.
You can manage #25,000 for me by Monday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cohenlupe said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)
would try, but intimated his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) opinion that there would be considerable
difficulty in the operation.




<p/>CHAPTER LIV.

<p/>THE INDIA OFFICE.


<p/>The Conservative party at this particular period was putting its
shoulder to the wheel,--not to push the coach up any hill, but
to prevent its being hurried along at a pace which was not only
dangerous, but manifestly destructive. The Conservative party now and
then does put its shoulder to the wheel, ostensibly with the great
national object above named; but also actuated by a natural desire to
keep its own head well above water and be generally doing something,
so that other parties may not suppose that it is moribund. There are,
no doubt, members of it who really think that when some object has
been achieved,--when, for instance, a good old Tory has been squeezed
into Parliament for the borough of Porcorum, which for the last three
parliaments has been represented by a Liberal,--the coach has been
really stopped. To them, in their delightful faith, there comes at
these triumphant moments a conviction that after all the people as
a people have not been really in earnest in their efforts to take
something from the greatness of the great, and to add something to
the lowliness of the lowly. The handle of the windlass has been
broken, the wheel is turning fast the reverse way, and the rope
of Radical progress is running back. Who knows what may not be
regained if the Conservative party will only put its shoulder to the
wheel and take care that the handle of the windlass be not mended!
Sticinthemud, which has ever been a doubtful little borough, has
just been carried by a majority of fifteen! A long pull, a strong
pull, and a pull altogether,--and the old day will come back again.
Venerable patriarchs think of Lord Liverpool and other heroes, and
dream dreams of Conservative bishops, Conservative lord-lieutenants,
and of a Conservative ministry that shall remain in for a generation.

<p/>Such a time was now present. Porcorum and Sticinthemud had done their
duty valiantly,--with much management. But Westminster! If this
special seat for Westminster could be carried, the country then could
hardly any longer have a doubt on the matter. If only Mr. Melmotte
could be got in for Westminster, it would be manifest that the people
were sound at heart, and that all the great changes which had been
effected during the last forty years,--from the first reform in
Parliament down to the Ballot,--had been managed by the cunning and
treachery of a few ambitious men. Not, however, that the Ballot was
just now regarded by the party as an unmitigated evil, though it
was the last triumph of Radical wickedness. The Ballot was on the
whole popular with the party. A short time since, no doubt it was
regarded by the party as being one and the same as national ruin and
national disgrace. But it had answered well at Porcorum, and with due
manipulation had been found to be favourable at Sticinthemud. The
Ballot might perhaps help the long pull and the strong pull,--and, in
spite of the ruin and disgrace, was thought by some just now to be a
highly Conservative measure. It was considered that the Ballot might
assist Melmotte at Westminster very materially.

<p/>Any one reading the Conservative papers of the time, and hearing the
Conservative speeches in the borough,--any one at least who lived so
remote as not to have learned what these things really mean,--would
have thought that England's welfare depended on Melmotte's return.
In the enthusiasm of the moment, the attacks made on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) character
were answered by eulogy as loud as the censure was bitter. The chief
crime laid to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) charge was connected with the ruin of some great
continental assurance company, as to which it was said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
so managed it as to leave it utterly stranded, with an enormous
fortune of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own. It was declared that every shilling which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
brought to England with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had consisted of plunder stolen from
the shareholders in the company. Now the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in its
endeavour to make the facts of this transaction known, had placed
what it called the domicile of this company in Paris, whereas it was
ascertained that its official head-quarters had in truth been placed
at Vienna. Was not such a blunder as this sufficient to show that no
merchant of higher honour than Mr. Melmotte had ever adorned the
Exchanges of modern capitals? And then two different newspapers of
the time, both of them antagonistic to Melmotte, failed to be in
accord on a material point. One declared that Mr. Melmotte was not in
truth possessed of any wealth. The other said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had derived his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
wealth from those unfortunate shareholders. Could anything betray
so bad a cause as contradictions such as these? Could anything
be so false, so weak, so malignant, so useless, so wicked, so
self-condemned,--in fact, so <div class="bookquote">``Liberal''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as a course of action such
as this? The belief naturally to be deduced from such statements,
nay, the unavoidable conviction on the minds--of, at any rate, the
Conservative newspapers--was that Mr. Melmotte had accumulated an
immense fortune, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had never robbed any shareholder of a
shilling.

<p/>The friends of Melmotte had moreover a basis of hope, and were
enabled to sound premonitory notes of triumph, arising from causes
quite external to their party. The <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>supported
Melmotte, but the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>was not a Conservative organ.
This support was given, not to the great man's political opinions, as
to which a well-known writer in that paper suggested that the great
man had probably not as yet given very much attention to the party
questions which divided the country,--but to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) commercial position.
It was generally acknowledged that few men living,--perhaps no man
alive,--had so acute an insight into the great commercial questions
of the age as Mr. Augustus Melmotte. In whatever part of the world he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
might have acquired his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) commercial experience,--for it had been said
repeatedly that Melmotte was not an Englishman,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) now made London
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) home and Great Britain his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) country, and it would be for the
welfare of the country that such a man should sit in the British
Parliament. Such were the arguments used by the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>in
supporting Mr. Melmotte. This was, of course, an assistance;--and not
the less so because it was asserted in other papers that the country
would be absolutely disgraced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) presence in Parliament. The
hotter the opposition the keener will be the support. Honest good
men, men who really loved their country, fine gentlemen, who had
received unsullied names from great ancestors, shed their money right
and left, and grew hot in personally energetic struggles to have this
man returned to Parliament as the head of the great Conservative
mercantile interests of Great Britain!

<p/>There was one man who thoroughly believed that the thing at the
present moment most essentially necessary to England's glory was the
return of Mr. Melmotte for Westminster. This man was undoubtedly a
very ignorant man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew nothing of any one political question
which had vexed England for the last half century,--nothing whatever
of the political history which had made England what it was at the
beginning of that half century. Of such names as Hampden, Somers, and
Pitt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hardly ever heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had probably never read a book in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew nothing of the working of parliament, nothing of
nationality,--had no preference whatever for one form of government
over another, never having given his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind a moment's trouble on
the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not even reflected how a despotic monarch or
a federal republic might affect himself, and possibly did not
comprehend the meaning of those terms. But yet he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) was fully confident
that England did demand and ought to demand that Mr. Melmotte should
be returned for Westminster. This man was Mr. Melmotte himself.

<p/>In this conjunction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) affairs Mr. Melmotte certainly lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had audacity almost sufficient for the very dangerous game
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was playing; but, as crisis heaped itself upon crisis, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
became deficient in prudence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not hesitate to speak of himself
as the man who ought to represent Westminster, and of those who
opposed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as little malignant beings who had mean interests of
their own to serve. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went about in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) open carriage, with Lord
Alfred at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left hand, with a look on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face which seemed to
imply that Westminster was not good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even hinted
to certain political friends that at the next general election he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
should try the City. Six months since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been a humble man to a
Lord,--but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) scolded Earls and snubbed Dukes, and yet did it in
a manner which showed how proud he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was of connecting himself with
their social pre-eminence, and how ignorant of the manner in which
such pre-eminence affects English gentlemen generally. The more
arrogant he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) became the more vulgar he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was, till even Lord Alfred
would almost be tempted to rush away to impecuniosity and freedom.
Perhaps there were some with whom this conduct had a salutary effect.
No doubt arrogance will produce submission; and there are men who
take other men at the price those other men put upon themselves. Such
persons could not refrain from thinking Melmotte to be mighty because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) swaggered; and gave their hinder parts to be kicked merely because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) toe. We all know men of this calibre,--and how they
seem to grow in number. But the net result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) personal demeanour
was injurious; and it was debated among some of the warmest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
supporters whether a hint should not be given him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't Lord
Alfred say a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beauchamp</b></font>)</div>said the Honourable Beauchamp Beauclerk,
who, himself in Parliament, a leading man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) party, thoroughly
well acquainted with the borough, wealthy and connected by blood with
half the great Conservative families in the kingdom, had been moving
heaven and earth on behalf of the great financial king, and working
like a slave for his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alfred's more than half afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupton/Lionel Lupton</b></font>)</div>said Lionel Lupton, a young
aristocrat, also in Parliament, who had been inoculated with the
idea that the interests of the party demanded Melmotte in Parliament,
but who would have given up his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) Scotch shooting rather than have
undergone Melmotte's company for a day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something really must be done, Mr. Beauclerk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jones</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jones, who
was the leading member of a very wealthy firm of builders in the
borough, who had become a Conservative politician, who had thoughts
of the House for himself, but who never forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) own position. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>)
is making a great many personal enemies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>)'s the finest old turkey cock out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupton/Lionel Lupton</b></font>)</div>said Lionel Lupton.

<p/>Then it was decided that Mr. Beauclerk should speak a word to Lord
Alfred. The rich man and the poor man were cousins, and had always
been intimate. <div class="bookquote">``Alfred,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mentor</b></font>)</div>said the chosen mentor at the club one
afternoon, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether you couldn't say something to Melmotte
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) manner.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mentor</b></font>)</div>Lord Alfred turned sharp round and looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
companion's face. <div class="bookquote">``They tell me he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is giving offence. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
doesn't mean it. Couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) draw it a little milder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Alfred made his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) reply almost in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``If you ask me, I
don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could. If you got him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) down and trampled on him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), you
might make him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mild. I don't think there's any other way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not unless I did it with a horsewhip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div><p/>This, coming from Lord Alfred, who was absolutely dependent on the
man, was very strong. Lord Alfred had been much afflicted that
morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) had spent some hours with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) friend, either going about
the borough in the open carriage, or standing just behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) at
meetings, or sitting close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) in committee-rooms,--and had been
nauseated with Melmotte. When spoken to about his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) friend he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could not
restrain himself. Lord Alfred had been born and bred a gentleman, and
found the position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was now earning his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) bread to be almost
insupportable. It had gone against the grain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) at first, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was called Alfred; but now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was told <div class="bookquote">``just to open the
door,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``just to give that message,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) almost meditated revenge.
Lord Nidderdale, who was quick at observation, had seen something of
this in Grosvenor Square, and declared that Lord Alfred had invested
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) recent savings in a cutting whip. Mr. Beauclerk, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) answer, whistled and withdrew. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was true to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
party. Melmotte was not the first vulgar man whom the Conservatives
had taken by the hand, and patted on the back, and told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a
god.

<p/>The Emperor of China was now in England, and was to be entertained
one night at the India Office. The Secretary of State for the second
great Asiatic Empire was to entertain the ruler of the first. This
was on Saturday the 6th of July, and Melmotte's dinner was to take
place on the following Monday. Very great interest was made by the
London world generally to obtain admission to the India Office,--the
making of such interest consisting in the most abject begging for
tickets of admission, addressed to the Secretary of State, to all
the under secretaries, to assistant secretaries, secretaries of
departments, chief clerks, and to head-messengers and their wives.
If a petitioner could not be admitted as a guest into the splendour
of the reception rooms, might not he (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>),--or she (<font color='blue'><b>clerks</b></font>),--be allowed to stand
in some passage whence the Emperor's back might perhaps be seen,--so
that, if possible, the petitioner's name might be printed in the
list of guests which would be published on the next morning? Now Mr.
Melmotte with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) family was, of course, supplied with tickets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),
who was to spend a fortune in giving the Emperor a dinner, was of
course entitled to be present at other places to which the Emperor
would be brought to be shown. Melmotte had already seen the Emperor
at a breakfast in Windsor Park, and at a ball in royal halls. But
hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not been presented to the Emperor. Presentations have
to be restricted,--if only on the score of time; and it had been
thought that as Mr. Melmotte would of course have some communication
with the hardworked Emperor at his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) own house, that would suffice. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had felt himself to be ill-used and was offended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) spoke with
bitterness to some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) supporters of the Royal Family generally,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had not been brought to the front rank either at the
breakfast or at the ball,--and now, at the India Office, was
determined to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) due. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) was not on the list of those whom
the Secretary of State intended on this occasion to present to the
Brother of the Sun.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) had dined freely. At this period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) career he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) had taken to
dining freely,--which was in itself imprudent, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) had need at all
hours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) best intelligence. Let it not be understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>)
was tipsy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) was a man whom wine did not often affect after that
fashion. But it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>), who was arrogant before, tower in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>)
arrogance till he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) was almost sure to totter. It was probably at some
moment after dinner that Lord Alfred decided upon buying the cutting
whip of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) had spoken. Melmotte went with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife and daughter
to the India Office, and soon left them far in the background with a
request,--we may say an order,--to Lord Alfred to take care of them.
It may be observed here that Marie Melmotte was almost as great a
curiosity as the Emperor himself, and was much noticed as the girl
who had attempted to run away to New York, but had gone without her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
lover. Melmotte entertained some foolish idea that as the India
Office was in Westminster, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had a peculiar right to demand an
introduction on this occasion because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) candidature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did
succeed in getting hold of an unfortunate under secretary of state, a
studious and invaluable young peer, known as Earl De Griffin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) was
a shy man, of enormous wealth, of mediocre intellect, and no great
physical ability, who never amused himself; but worked hard night and
day, and read everything that anybody could write, and more than any
other person could read, about India. Had Mr. Melmotte wanted to know
the exact dietary of the peasants in Orissa, or the revenue of the
Punjaub, or the amount of crime in Bombay, Lord De Griffin would have
informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) without a pause. But in this matter of managing the
Emperor, the under secretary had nothing to do, and would have been
the last man to be engaged in such a service. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, however, second
in command at the India Office, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) official rank Melmotte was
unfortunately made aware. <div class="bookquote">``My Lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), by no means hiding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) demand in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I am desirous of being presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
Imperial Majesty.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lord De Griffin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) in despair, not
knowing the great man,--being one of the few men in that room who did
not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Lord Alfred, who had deserted the ladies
and still stuck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) master. <div class="bookquote">``Lord De Griffin, let me introduce you
to Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--oh--oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord De Griffin</b></font>)</div>said Lord De Griffin, just putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I am
delighted;--ah, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>and pretending to see somebody, he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) made a weak
and quite ineffectual attempt to escape.

<p/>Melmotte stood directly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) way, and with unabashed audacity
repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) demand. <div class="bookquote">``I am desirous of being presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
Imperial Majesty. Will you do me the honour of making my request
known to Mr. Wilson?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilson/Wilson</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wilson was the Secretary of State, who was
as busy as a Secretary of State is sure to be on such an occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord De Griffin</b></font>)</div>said Lord De Griffin. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it's all arranged.
I don't know anything about it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can introduce me to Mr. Wilson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>)'s up there, Mr. Melmotte; and I couldn't get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Really you
must excuse me. I'm very sorry. If I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>secretary</b></font>)</div>And the
poor under secretary again endeavoured to escape.

<p/>Mr. Melmotte put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand and stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to stand
this kind of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said. The old Marquis of Auld Reekie was
close at hand, the father of Lord Nidderdale, and therefore the
proposed father-in-law of Melmotte's daughter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
thumb heavily into Lord Alfred's ribs. <div class="bookquote">``It is generally understood,
I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>continued Melmotte, <div class="bookquote">``that the Emperor is to do me the
honour of dining at my poor house on Monday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) don't dine there
unless I'm made acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) comes. I mean what
I say. I ain't going to entertain even an Emperor unless I'm good
enough to be presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>). Perhaps you'd better let Mr. Wilson
know, as a good many people intend to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a row,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the old Marquis. <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>)'d be as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>)
word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) has taken a little wine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>whispered Lord Alfred. <div class="bookquote">``Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
said, still whispering; <div class="bookquote">``upon my word it isn't the thing. They're
only Indian chaps and Eastern swells who are presented here,--not a
fellow among 'em all who hasn't been in India or China, or isn't a
Secretary of State, or something of that kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then they should have done it at Windsor, or at the ball,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said
Melmotte, pulling down his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) waistcoat. <div class="bookquote">``By George, Alfred! I'm in
earnest, and somebody had better look to it. If I'm not presented to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) Imperial Majesty to-night, by G--, there shall be no dinner
in Grosvenor Square on Monday. I'm master enough of my own house, I
suppose, to be able to manage that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>Here was a row, as the Marquis had said! Lord De Griffin was
frightened, and Lord Alfred felt that something ought to be done.
<div class="bookquote">``There's no knowing how far the pig-headed brute may go in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
obstinacy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>Lord Alfred said to Mr. Lupton, who was there. It no
doubt might have been wise to have allowed the merchant prince to
return home with the resolution that his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) dinner should be abandoned.
He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) would have repented probably before the next morning; and had
he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) continued obdurate it would not have been difficult to explain
to Celestial Majesty that something preferable had been found for
that particular evening even to a banquet at the house of British
commerce. The Government would probably have gained the seat for
Westminster, as Melmotte would at once have become very unpopular
with the great body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) supporters. But Lord De Griffin was not
the man to see this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) did make his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) way up to Mr. Wilson, and
explained to the Amphytrion of the night the demand which was made
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) hospitality. A thoroughly well-established and experienced
political Minister of State always feels that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) can make a friend
or appease an enemy without paying a heavy price he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) will be doing a
good stroke of business. <div class="bookquote">``Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilson/Wilson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilson. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)'s going
to do something out in the East, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing in India,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord De Griffin</b></font>)</div>said
Lord De Griffin. <div class="bookquote">``The submarine telegraph is quite impossible.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilson/Wilson</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Wilson, instructing some satellite to find out in what way he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) might
properly connect Mr. Melmotte with China, sent Lord De Griffin away
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) commission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Alfred, just allow me to manage these things myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Melmotte was saying when the under secretary returned. <div class="bookquote">``I know my own
position and how to keep it. There shall be no dinner. I'll be d--
if any of the lot shall dine in Grosvenor Square on Monday.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>Lord
Alfred was so astounded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was thinking of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) way to
the Prime Minister, a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) abhorred and didn't know, and of
acquainting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) with the terrible calamity which was threatened. But
the arrival of the under secretary saved him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) the trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will come with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord De Griffin</b></font>)</div>whispered Lord De Griffin, <div class="bookquote">``it shall be
managed. It isn't just the thing, but as you wish it, it shall be
done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord De Griffin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do wish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte aloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was one of those men whom
success never mollified, whose enjoyment of a point gained always
demanded some hoarse note of triumph from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own trumpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will be so kind as to follow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord De Griffin</b></font>)</div>said Lord De Griffin. And
so the thing was done. Melmotte, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was taken up to the imperial
footstool, was resolved upon making a little speech, forgetful at
the moment of interpreters,--of the double interpreters whom the
Majesty of China required; but the awful, quiescent solemnity of the
celestial one quelled even him (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) shuffled by without saying a
word even of his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) own banquet.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) had gained his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) point, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) was taken home to poor Mr.
Longestaffe's house in Bruton Street, was intolerable. Lord Alfred
tried to escape after putting Madame Melmotte and her (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) daughter into
the carriage, but Melmotte insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) presence. <div class="bookquote">``You might as
well come, Alfred;--there are two or three things I must settle
before I go to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm about knocked up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the unfortunate man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knocked up, nonsense! Think what I've been through. I've been all
day at the hardest work a man can do.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as usual got in first,
leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) man-of-all-work to follow, the man-of-all-work would
have escaped. Melmotte, fearing such defection, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand on Lord
Alfred's shoulder, and the poor fellow was beaten. As they were taken
home a continual sound of cock-crowing was audible, but as the words
were not distinguished they required no painful attention; but when
the soda water and brandy and cigars made their appearance in Mr.
Longestaffe's own back room, then the trumpet was sounded with a full
blast. <div class="bookquote">``I mean to let the fellows know what's what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte,
walking about the room. Lord Alfred had thrown himself into an
arm-chair, and was consoling himself as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) might with tobacco.
<div class="bookquote">``Give and take is a very good motto. If I scratch their back, I
mean them to scratch mine. They won't find many people to spend ten
thousand pounds in entertaining a guest of the country's as a private
enterprise. I don't know of any other man of business who could
do it, or would do it. It's not much any of them can do for me.
Thank God, I don't want 'em. But if consideration is to be shown
to anybody, I intend to be considered. The Prince treated me very
scurvily, Alfred, and I shall take an opportunity of telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
so on Monday. I suppose a man may be allowed to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
guests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might turn the election against you if you said anything the
Prince didn't like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``D-- the election, sir. I stand before the electors of Westminster
as a man of business, not as a courtier,--as a man who understands
commercial enterprise, not as one of the Prince's toadies. Some of
you fellows in England don't realise the matter yet; but I can tell
you that I think myself quite as great a man as any Prince.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>Lord
Alfred looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), with strong reminiscences of the old ducal
home, and shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``I'll teach them a lesson before long. Didn't I
teach 'em a lesson to-night,--eh? They tell me that Lord De Griffin
has sixty thousand a-year to spend. What's sixty thousand a year?
Didn't I make him (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) go on my business? And didn't I make 'em do as I
chose? You want to tell me this and that, but I can tell you that I
know more of men and women than some of you fellows do, who think you
know a great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This went on through the whole of a long cigar; and afterwards,
as Lord Alfred slowly paced his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) way back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) lodgings in Mount
Street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) thought deeply whether there might not be means of
escaping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) present servitude. <div class="bookquote">``Beast! Brute! Pig!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) said to
himself over and over again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) slowly went to Mount Street.




<p/>CHAPTER LV.

<p/>CLERICAL CHARITIES.


<p/>Melmotte's success, and Melmotte's wealth, and Melmotte's antecedents
were much discussed down in Suffolk at this time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been seen
there in the flesh, and there is no believing like that which comes
from sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been staying at Caversham, and many in those parts
knew that Miss Longestaffe was now living in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) house in London.
The purchase of the Pickering estate had also been noticed in all
the Suffolk and Norfolk newspapers. Rumours, therefore, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) past
frauds, rumour also as to the instability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) presumed fortune,
were as current as those which declared him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to be by far the richest
man in England. Miss Melmotte's little attempt had also been
communicated in the papers; and Sir Felix, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
recognised as being <div class="bookquote">``real Suffolk''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>himself, was so far connected
with Suffolk by name as to add something to this feeling of reality
respecting the Melmottes generally. Suffolk is very old-fashioned.
Suffolk, taken as a whole, did not like the Melmotte fashion.
Suffolk, which is, I fear, persistently and irrecoverably
Conservative, did not believe in Melmotte as a Conservative Member
of Parliament. Suffolk on this occasion was rather ashamed of the
Longestaffes, and took occasion to remember that it was barely the
other day, as Suffolk counts days, since the original Longestaffe was
in trade. This selling of Pickering, and especially the selling of
it to Melmotte, was a mean thing. Suffolk, as a whole, thoroughly
believed that Melmotte had picked the very bones of every shareholder
in that Franco-Austrian Assurance Company.

<p/>Mr. Hepworth was over with Roger one morning, and they were talking
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Hepworth</b></font>),--or talking rather of the attempted elopement. <div class="bookquote">``I know
nothing about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, <div class="bookquote">``and I do not intend to ask. Of course
I did know when they were down here that he (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) hoped to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and I
did believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was willing to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>). But whether the father
had consented or not I never enquired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Nothing could have been more unfortunate for either of them than
such a marriage. Melmotte will probably be in the <div class="bookquote">``Gazette' before
long, and my cousin not only has not a shilling, but could not keep
one if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think Melmotte will turn out a failure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A failure! Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s a failure, whether rich or poor;--a
miserable imposition, a hollow vulgar fraud from beginning to
end,--too insignificant for you and me to talk of, were it not that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) position is a sign of the degeneracy of the age. What are we
coming to when such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is an honoured guest at our tables?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At just a table here and there,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>suggested his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--it is not that. You can keep your house free from him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and so
can I mine. But we set no example to the nation at large. They who do
set the example go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) feasts, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is seen at theirs
in return. And yet these leaders of the fashion know,--at any rate
they believe,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has been a swindler
greater than other swindlers. What follows as a natural consequence?
Men reconcile themselves to swindling. Though they themselves mean
to be honest, dishonesty of itself is no longer odious to them. Then
there comes the jealousy that others should be growing rich with the
approval of all the world,--and the natural aptitude to do what all
the world approves. It seems to me that the existence of a Melmotte
is not compatible with a wholesome state of things in general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger dined with the Bishop of Elmham that evening, and the same hero
was discussed under a different heading. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has given #200,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bishop</b></font>)</div>said
the Bishop, <div class="bookquote">``to the Curates' Aid Society. I don't know that a man
could spend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money much better than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bishop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clap-trap!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) present mood was very bitter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The money is not clap-trap, my friend. I presume that the money is
really paid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel at all sure of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our collectors for clerical charities are usually stern men,--very
ready to make known defalcations on the part of promising
subscribers. I think they would take care to get the money during the
election.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think that money got in that way redounds to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) credit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a gift shows him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to be a useful member of society,--and I am
always for encouraging useful men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even though their own objects may be vile and pernicious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you beg ever so many questions, Mr. Carbury. Mr. Melmotte
wishes to get into Parliament, and if there would vote on the side
which you at any rate approve. I do not know that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) object in that
respect is pernicious. And as a seat in Parliament has been a matter
of ambition to the best of our countrymen for centuries, I do not
know why we should say that it is vile in this man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger frowned
and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Of course Mr. Melmotte is not the sort of
gentleman whom you have been accustomed to regard as a fitting member
for a Conservative constituency. But the country is changing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's going to the dogs, I think;--about as fast as it can go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We build churches much faster than we used to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do we say our prayers in them when we have built them?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>asked the
Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very hard to see into the minds of men,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Bishop</b></font>)</div>said the Bishop;
<div class="bookquote">``but we can see the results of their minds' work. I think that men
on the whole do live better lives than they did a hundred years ago.
There is a wider spirit of justice abroad, more of mercy from one to
another, a more lively charity, and if less of religious enthusiasm,
less also of superstition. Men will hardly go to heaven, Mr. Carbury,
by following forms only because their fathers followed the same forms
before them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Bishop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose men will go to heaven, my Lord, by doing as they would be
done by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no safer lesson. But we must hope that some may be
saved even if they have not practised at all times that grand
self-denial. Who comes up to that teaching? Do you not wish for,
nay, almost demand, instant pardon for any trespass that you may
commit,--of temper, or manner, for instance? and are you always ready
to forgive in that way yourself? Do you not writhe with indignation
at being wrongly judged by others who condemn you without knowing
your actions or the causes of them; and do you never judge others
after that fashion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not put myself forward as an example.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I apologise for the personal form of my appeal. A clergyman is apt
to forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is not in the pulpit. Of course I speak of men in
general. Taking society as a whole, the big and the little, the rich
and the poor, I think that it grows better from year to year, and not
worse. I think, too, that they who grumble at the times, as Horace
did, and declare that each age is worse than its forerunner, look
only at the small things beneath their eyes, and ignore the course of
the world at large.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Roman freedom and Roman manners were going to the dogs when
Horace wrote.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Christ was about to be born, and men were already being made fit
by wider intelligence for Christ's teaching. And as for freedom, has
not freedom grown, almost every year, from that to this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Rome they were worshipping just such men as this Melmotte. Do you
remember the man who sat upon the seats of the knights and scoured
the Via Sacra with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) toga, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been scourged from pillar
to post for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) villainies? I always think of that man when I hear
Melmotte's name mentioned. Hoc, hoc tribuno militum! Is this the man
to be Conservative member for Westminster?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know of the scourges, as a fact?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I know that they are deserved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is hardly doing to others as you would be done by. If the man
is what you say, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will surely be found out at last, and the day of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) punishment will come. Your friend in the ode probably had a bad
time of it, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farms and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horses. The world perhaps
is managed more justly than you think, Mr. Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lord, I believe you're a Radical at heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely,--very likely. Only don't say so to the Prime Minister,
or I shall never get any of the better things which may be going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Bishop</b></font>)</div><p/>The Bishop was not hopelessly in love with a young lady, and was
therefore less inclined to take a melancholy view of things in
general than Roger Carbury. To Roger everything seemed to be out
of joint. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had that morning received a letter from Lady Carbury,
reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) of the promise of a loan, should a time come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
of great need. It had come very quickly. Roger Carbury did not in
the least begrudge the hundred pounds which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had already sent to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did begrudge any furtherance afforded to the
iniquitous schemes of Sir Felix. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) felt all but sure that the
foolish mother had given her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son money for his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) abortive attempt, and
that therefore this appeal had been made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) alluded to no
such fear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) simply enclosed the cheque, and expressed
a hope that the amount might suffice for the present emergency. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was disheartened and disgusted by all the circumstances of the
Carbury family. There was Paul Montague, bringing a woman such as
Mrs. Hurtle down to Lowestoft, declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) purpose of continuing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) visits to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), and, as Roger thought, utterly unable to free
himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) toils,--and yet, on this man's account, Hetta was
cold and hard to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was conscious of the honesty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own
love, sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) happy,--confident, not in himself,
but in the fashion and ways of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own life. What would be Hetta's
lot if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) heart was really given to Paul Montague?

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) got home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) found Father Barham sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) library. An
accident had lately happened at Father Barham's own establishment.
The wind had blown the roof off his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) cottage; and Roger Carbury,
though his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) affection for the priest was waning, had offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
shelter while the damage was being repaired. Shelter at Carbury Manor
was very much more comfortable than the priest's own establishment,
even with the roof on, and Father Barham was in clover. Father Barham
was reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) own favourite newspaper, <div class="bookquote">``The Surplice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barham/Mr. Barham/BARHAM</b></font>)</div>when Roger
entered the room. <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen this, Mr. Carbury?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said.

<p/>``What's this? I am not likely to have seen anything that belongs
peculiarly to <div class="bookquote">``The Surplice.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the prejudice of what you are pleased to call the Anglican
Church. Mr. Melmotte is a convert to our faith. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is a great man,
and will perhaps be one of the greatest known on the face of the
globe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Melmotte a convert to Romanism! I'll make you a present of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and
thank you to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>); but I don't believe that we've any such good
riddance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Father Barham read a paragraph out of <div class="bookquote">``The Surplice.''  (<font color='red'><b>Barham/Mr. Barham/BARHAM</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr.

by a letter from Mr. Melmotte's secretary, which leaves but little
doubt that the new member for Westminster will be a member, and no
inconsiderable member, of the Catholic party in the House, during the
next session.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's another dodge, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by a dodge, Mr. Carbury? Because money is given for

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Father Barham, the day before the same great man gave

Carbury, without another word, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) candle and went to bed.




<p/>CHAPTER LVI.

<p/>FATHER BARHAM VISITS LONDON.


<p/>It was considered to be a great thing to catch the Roman Catholic
vote in Westminster. For many years it has been considered a great
thing both in the House and out of the House to <div class="bookquote">``catch''  (<font color='red'><b>House/Carbury Manor House/Manor House</b></font>)</div>Roman
Catholic votes. There are two modes of catching these votes. This or
that individual Roman Catholic may be promoted to place, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Catholic</b></font>)
personally may be made secure; or the right hand of fellowship may
be extended to the people of the Pope generally, so that the people
of the Pope may be taught to think that a general step is being
made towards the reconversion of the nation. The first measure is
the easier, but the effect is but slight and soon passes away. The
promoted one, though as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) prayers go he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) may remain as
good a Catholic as ever, soon ceases to be one of the party to be
conciliated, and is apt after a while to be regarded by them as an
enemy. But the other mode, if a step be well taken, may be very
efficacious. It has now and then occurred that every Roman Catholic
in Ireland and England has been brought to believe that the nation
is coming round to them;--and in this or that borough the same
conviction has been made to grow. To catch the Protestant,--that is
the peculiarly Protestant,--vote and the Roman Catholic vote at the
same instant is a feat difficult of accomplishment; but it has been
attempted before, and was attempted now by Mr. Melmotte and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
friends. It was perhaps thought by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) friends that the Protestants
would not notice the #100 given for the altar to St. Fabricius; but
Mr. Alf was wide awake, and took care that Mr. Melmotte's religious
opinions should be a matter of interest to the world at large. During
all that period of newspaper excitement there was perhaps no article
that created so much general interest as that which appeared in the
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a special question asked at the head of it,
<div class="bookquote">``For Priest or Parson?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>In this article, which was more than usually
delightful as being pungent from the beginning to the end and as
being unalloyed with any dry didactic wisdom, Mr. Alf's man, who did
that business, declared that it was really important that the nation
at large and especially the electors of Westminster should know what
was the nature of Mr. Melmotte's faith. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a man of a highly
religious temperament was most certain by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) munificent charities
on behalf of religion. Two noble donations, which by chance had been
made just at this crisis, were doubtless no more than the regular
continuation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ordinary flow of Christian benevolence. The
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>by no means insinuated that the gifts were intended
to have any reference to the approaching election. Far be it from
the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>that a man</b></font>)</div>to imagine that so great a man as Mr. Melmotte
looked for any return in this world from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) charitable generosity.
But still, as Protestants naturally desired to be represented
in Parliament by a Protestant member, and as Roman Catholics as
naturally desired to be represented by a Roman Catholic, perhaps Mr.
Melmotte would not object to declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) creed.

<p/>This was biting, and of course did mischief; but Mr. Melmotte and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
manager were not foolish enough to allow it to actuate them in any
way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had thrown his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bread upon the waters, assisting St. Fabricius
with one hand and the Protestant curates with the other, and must
leave the results to take care of themselves. If the Protestants
chose to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was hyper-protestant, and the Catholics
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was tending towards papacy, so much the better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Any
enthusiastic religionists wishing to enjoy such conviction's would
not allow themselves to be enlightened by the manifestly interested
malignity of Mr. Alf's newspaper.

<p/>It may be doubted whether the donation to the Curates' Aid Society
did have much effect. It may perhaps have induced a resolution in
some few to go to the poll whose minds were active in regard to
religion and torpid as to politics. But the donation to St. Fabricius
certainly had results. It was taken up and made much of by the Roman
Catholic party generally, till a report got itself spread abroad and
almost believed that Mr. Melmotte was going to join the Church of
Rome. These manoeuvres require most delicate handling, or evil may
follow instead of good. On the second afternoon after the question
had been asked in the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>an answer to it appeared,
<div class="bookquote">``For Priest and not for Parson.''  (<font color='red'><b>Roman</b></font>)</div>Therein various assertions made by
Roman Catholic organs and repeated in Roman Catholic speeches were
brought together, so as to show that Mr. Melmotte really had at last
made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind on this important question. All the world knew
now, said Mr. Alf's writer, that with that keen sense of honesty
which was the Great Financier's peculiar characteristic,--the Great
Financier was the name which Mr. Alf had specially invented for Mr.
Melmotte,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had doubted, till the truth was absolutely borne in
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could serve the nation best as a Liberal or as
a Conservative. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had solved that doubt with wisdom. And now this
other doubt had passed through the crucible, and by the aid of fire a
golden certainty had been produced. The world of Westminster at last
knew that Mr. Melmotte was a Roman Catholic. Now nothing was clearer
than this,--that though catching the Catholic vote would greatly help
a candidate, no real Roman Catholic could hope to be returned. This
last article vexed Mr. Melmotte, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) proposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) friends to
send a letter to the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>asserting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) adhered
to the Protestant faith of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ancestors. But, as it was suspected
by many, and was now being whispered to the world at large, that
Melmotte had been born a Jew, this assurance would perhaps have been
too strong. <div class="bookquote">``Do nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beauclerk/Beauchamp Beauclerk/Mr. Beauchamp Beauclerk</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beauchamp Beauclerk.
<div class="bookquote">``If any one asks you a question at any meeting, say that you are a
Protestant. But it isn't likely, as we have none but our own people.
Don't go writing letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>St. Fabricius/Fabricius</b></font>)</div><p/>But unfortunately the gift of an altar to St. Fabricius was such
a godsend that sundry priests about the country were determined
to cling to the good man who had bestowed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money so well. I
think that many of them did believe that this was a great sign of a
beauteous stirring of people's minds in favour of Rome. The fervent
Romanists have always this point in their favour, that they are ready
to believe. And they have a desire for the conversion of men which
is honest in an exactly inverse ratio to the dishonesty of the means
which they employ to produce it. Father Barham was ready to sacrifice
anything personal to himself in the good cause,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>)
health, his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) money when he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had any, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) life. Much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) liked the
comfort of Carbury Hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) would never for a moment condescend to
ensure its continued enjoyment by reticence as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) religion. Roger
Carbury was hard of heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could see that. But the dropping of
water might hollow the stone. If the dropping should be put an end
to by outward circumstances before the stone had been impressed that
would not be his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at any rate would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) duty. In that
fixed resolution Father Barham was admirable. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had no scruple
whatsoever as to the nature of the arguments he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) would use,--or as
to the facts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) would proclaim. With the mingled ignorance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) life and the positiveness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) faith he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had at once made up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) mind that Melmotte was a great man, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might be made a
great instrument on behalf of the Pope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) believed in the enormous
proportions of the man's wealth,--believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) was powerful in
all quarters of the globe,--and believed, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) was so told by
<div class="bookquote">``The Surplice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that the man was at heart a Catholic. That a man
should be at heart a Catholic, and live in the world professing the
Protestant religion, was not to Father Barham either improbable or
distressing. Kings who had done so were to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) objects of veneration.
By such subterfuges and falsehood of life had they been best able
to keep alive the spark of heavenly fire. There was a mystery and
religious intrigue in this which recommended itself to the young
priest's mind. But it was clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) that this was a peculiar
time,--in which it behoved an earnest man to be doing something. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had for some weeks been preparing himself for a trip to London in
order that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might spend a week in retreat with kindred souls who
from time to time betook themselves to the cells of St. Fabricius.
And so, just at this season of the Westminster election, Father
Barham made a journey to London.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) had conceived the great idea of having a word or two with Mr.
Melmotte himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might be convinced by a word or
two as to the man's faith. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, also, that it might be a
happiness to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hereafter to have had intercourse with a man who
was perhaps destined to be the means of restoring the true faith to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country. On Saturday night,--that Saturday night on which Mr.
Melmotte had so successfully exercised his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) greatness at the India
Office,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) quarters in the cloisters of St. Fabricius;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) spent a goodly festive Sunday among the various Romanist church
services of the metropolis; and on the Monday morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sallied
forth in quest of Mr. Melmotte. Having obtained that address from
some circular, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went first to Abchurch Lane. But on this day, and
on the next, which would be the day of the election, Mr. Melmotte was
not expected in the City, and the priest was referred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) present
private residence in Bruton Street. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was told that the great
man might probably be found in Grosvenor Square, and at the house in
the square Father Barham was at last successful. Mr. Melmotte was
there superintending the arrangements for the entertainment of the
Emperor.

<p/>The servants, or more probably the workmen, must have been at fault
in giving the priest admittance. But in truth the house was in
great confusion. The wreaths of flowers and green boughs were being
suspended, last daubs of heavy gilding were being given to the wooden
capitals of mock pilasters, incense was being burned to kill the
smell of the paint, tables were being fixed and chairs were being
moved; and an enormous set of open presses were being nailed together
for the accommodation of hats and cloaks. The hall was chaos, and
poor Father Barham, who had heard a good deal of the Westminster
election, but not a word of the intended entertainment of the
Emperor, was at a loss to conceive for what purpose these operations
were carried on. But through the chaos he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) way, and did soon
find himself in the presence of Mr. Melmotte in the banqueting hall.

<p/>Mr. Melmotte was attended both by Lord Alfred and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
standing in front of the chair which had been arranged for the
Emperor, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat on one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was very angry
indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been given to understand when the dinner was first
planned, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was to sit opposite to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) august guest;--by which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had conceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was to have a seat immediately in face of
the Emperor of Emperors, of the Brother of the Sun, of the Celestial
One himself. It was now explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) that this could not be
done. In face of the Emperor there must be a wide space, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)
Majesty might be able to look down the hall; and the royal princesses
who sat next to the Emperor, and the royal princes who sat next
to the princesses, must also be so indulged. And in this way Mr.
Melmotte's own seat became really quite obscure. Lord Alfred was
having a very bad time of it. ``It's that fellow from ``The Herald'
office did it, not me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) said, almost in a passion. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know
how people ought to sit. But that's the reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm d-- if I'm going to be treated in this way in my own house,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>were the first words which the priest heard. And as Father Barham
walked up the room and came close to the scene of action, unperceived
by either of the Grendalls, Mr. Melmotte was trying, but trying in
vain, to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own seat nearer to Imperial Majesty. A bar had been
put up of such a nature that Melmotte, sitting in the seat prepared
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), would absolutely be barred out from the centre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
hall. <div class="bookquote">``Who the d-- are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) asked, when the priest appeared
close before his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eyes on the inner or more imperial side of the bar.
It was not the habit of Father Barham's life to appear in sleek
apparel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) was ever clothed in the very rustiest brown black that
age can produce. In Beccles where he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) was known it signified little,
but in the halls of the great one in Grosvenor Square, perhaps the
stranger's welcome was cut to the measure of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) outer man. A comely
priest in glossy black might have been received with better grace.

<p/>Father Barham stood humbly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) hat off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) was a man of infinite
pluck; but outward humility--at any rate at the commencement of an
enterprise,--was the rule of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">``I am the Rev. Mr. Barham,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>said the visitor. <div class="bookquote">``I am the priest of Beccles in Suffolk. I believe I
am speaking to Mr. Melmotte.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my name, sir. And what may you want? I don't know whether you
are aware that you have found your way into my private dining-room
without any introduction. Where the mischief are the fellows, Alfred,
who ought to have seen about this? I wish you'd look to it, Miles.
Can anybody who pleases walk into my hall?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I came on a mission which I hope may be pleaded as my excuse,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>said
the priest. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was bold, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) found it difficult to explain
his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) mission. Had not Lord Alfred been there he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) could have done it
better, in spite of the very repulsive manner of the great man
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it business?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Alfred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly it is business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Barham</b></font>)</div>said Father Barham with a smile.

<p/>``But why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) come to me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) madness--to me especially? That's
what I want to know. I'll tell you what it is. There isn't a man
in all England at this moment thought of so much as--your humble
servant. I wonder whether the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Pulpit' people sent him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) here
now to find out really what is my religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mad as a hatter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Lord Alfred again;--<div class="bookquote">``just that and no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, I don't think you've the gift of seeing very far.
The truth is they don't know what to make of me;--and I don't intend
that they shall. I'm playing my game, and there isn't one of 'em
understands it except myself. It's no good my sitting here, you know.
I shan't be able to move. How am I to get at you if I want anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can you want? There'll be lots of servants about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have this bar down, at any rate.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) did succeed in having
removed the bar which had been specially put up to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
intrusion on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) own guests in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) own house. <div class="bookquote">``I look upon that
fellow's coming here as a very singular sign of the times,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) went
on to say. <div class="bookquote">``They'll want before long to know where I have my clothes
made, and who measures me for my boots!''  (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div>Perhaps the most remarkable
circumstance in the career of this remarkable man was the fact that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came almost to believe in himself.

<p/>Father Barham went away certainly disgusted; and yet not altogether
disheartened. The man had not declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not a Roman
Catholic. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shown himself to be a brute. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had blasphemed
and cursed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been outrageously uncivil to a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must
have known to be a minister of God. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had manifested himself to
this priest, who had been born an English gentleman, as being no
gentleman. But, not the less might he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) be a good Catholic,--or good
enough at any rate to be influential on the right side. To his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes
Melmotte, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) insolent vulgarity, was infinitely a more
hopeful man than Roger Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) insulted me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Barham</b></font>)</div>said Father Barham
to a brother religionist that evening within the cloisters of St.
Fabricius.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) intend to insult you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did. But what of that? It is not by the hands of
polished men, nor even of the courteous, that this work has to be
done. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was preparing for some great festival, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mind was
intent upon that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) entertains the Emperor of China this very day,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said the brother
priest, who, as a resident in London, heard from time to time what
was being done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Emperor of China! Ah, that accounts for it. I do think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)
is on our side, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) gave me but little encouragement for
saying so. Will they vote for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>), here at Westminster?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our people will. They think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) is rich and can help them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) wealth, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Barham</b></font>)</div>said Father Barham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some people do doubt;--but others say he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) is the richest man in the
world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) looked like it,--and spoke like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Barham</b></font>)</div>said Father Barham. <div class="bookquote">``Think
what such a man might do, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be really the wealthiest man in the
world! And if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been against us would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not have said so?
Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was uncivil, I am glad that I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>Father Barham, with
a simplicity that was singularly mingled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) religious cunning,
made himself believe before he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) returned to Beccles that Mr. Melmotte
was certainly a Roman Catholic.




<p/>CHAPTER LVII.

<p/>LORD NIDDERDALE TRIES HIS (<font color='blue'><b>NIDDERDALE</b></font>) HAND AGAIN.


<p/>Lord Nidderdale had half consented to renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) suit to Marie
Melmotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had at any rate half promised to call at Melmotte's
house on the Sunday with the object of so doing. As far as that
promise had been given it was broken, for on the Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not
seen in Bruton Street. Though not much given to severe thinking,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did feel that on this occasion there was need for thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
father's property was not very large. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) grandfather
had both been extravagant men, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) himself had done something
towards adding to the family embarrassments. It had been an
understood thing, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had commenced life, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was to marry
an heiress. In such families as his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), when such results have been
achieved, it is generally understood that matters shall be put right
by an heiress. It has become an institution, like primogeniture, and
is almost as serviceable for maintaining the proper order of things.
Rank squanders money; trade makes it;--and then trade purchases rank
by re-gilding its splendour. The arrangement, as it affects the
aristocracy generally, is well understood, and was quite approved of
by the old marquis--so that he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) had felt himself to be justified in
eating up the property, which his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) son's future marriage would renew
as a matter of course. Nidderdale himself had never dissented, had
entertained no fanciful theory opposed to this view, had never
alarmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father by any liaison tending towards matrimony with any
undowered beauty;--but had claimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) right to <div class="bookquote">``have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fling''
 (<font color='red'><b>any liaison</b></font>)</div>before he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) devoted himself to the redintegration of the family
property. His (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father had felt that it would be wrong and might
probably be foolish to oppose so natural a desire. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had regarded
all the circumstances of <div class="bookquote">``the fling''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>with indulgent eyes. But there
arose some little difference as to the duration of the fling, and
the father had at last found himself compelled to inform his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son
that if the fling were carried on much longer it must be done with
internecine war between himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heir. Nidderdale, whose sense
and temper were alike good, saw the thing quite in the proper light.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) assured his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had no intention of <div class="bookquote">``cutting up rough,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was ready for the heiress as soon as the heiress
should be put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) way, and set himself honestly about the task
imposed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). This had all been arranged at Auld Reekie Castle
during the last winter, and the reader knows the result.

<p/>But the affair had assumed abnormal difficulties. Perhaps the Marquis
had been wrong in flying at wealth which was reputed to be almost
unlimited, but which was not absolutely fixed. A couple of hundred
thousand pounds down might have been secured with greater ease. But
here there had been a prospect of endless money,--of an inheritance
which might not improbably make the Auld Reekie family conspicuous
for its wealth even among the most wealthy of the nobility. The
old man had fallen into the temptation, and abnormal difficulties
had been the result. Some of these the reader knows. Latterly
two difficulties had culminated above the others. The young lady
preferred another gentleman, and disagreeable stories were afloat,
not only as to the way in which the money had been made, but even as
to its very existence.

<p/>The Marquis, however, was a man who hated to be beaten. As far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
could learn from inquiry, the money would be there,--or, at least, so
much money as had been promised. A considerable sum, sufficient to
secure the bridegroom from absolute shipwreck,--though by no means
enough to make a brilliant marriage,--had in truth been already
settled on Marie, and was, indeed, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) possession. As to that, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
father had armed himself with a power of attorney for drawing the
income,--but had made over the property to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter, so that
in the event of unforeseen accidents on ``Change, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might retire
to obscure comfort, and have the means perhaps of beginning again
with whitewashed cleanliness. When doing this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had doubtless not
anticipated the grandeur to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would soon rise, or the fact
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was about to embark on seas so dangerous that this little
harbour of refuge would hardly offer security to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vessel. Marie
had been quite correct in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) story to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) favoured lover. And the
Marquis's lawyer had ascertained that if Marie ever married before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) herself had restored this money to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) husband would
be so far safe,--with this as a certainty and the immense remainder
in prospect. The Marquis had determined to persevere. Pickering was
to be added. Mr. Melmotte had been asked to depone the title-deeds,
and had promised to do so as soon as the day of the wedding should
have been fixed with the consent of all the parties. The Marquis's
lawyer had ventured to express a doubt; but the Marquis had
determined to persevere. The reader will, I trust, remember that
those dreadful misgivings, which are I trust agitating his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own mind,
have been borne in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) by information which had not as yet
reached the Marquis in all its details.

<p/>But Nidderdale had his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) doubts. That absurd elopement, which Melmotte
declared really to mean nothing,--the romance of a girl who wanted
to have one little fling of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) settled down for
life,--was perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) strongest objection. Sir Felix, no doubt, had
not gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>); but then one doesn't wish to have one's intended
wife even attempt to run off with any one but oneself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)'ll be
sick of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) by this time, I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father said to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What does it matter, if the money's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Marquis</b></font>)</div>The Marquis seemed to
think that the escapade had simply been the girl's revenge against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son for having made his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) arrangements so exclusively with
Melmotte, instead of devoting himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Nidderdale acknowledged
to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had been remiss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) told himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
possessed of more spirit than he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had thought. By the Sunday evening
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would try again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had expected that the
plum would fall into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would now stretch out his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) hand to
pick it.

<p/>On the Monday he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) went to the house in Bruton Street, at lunch time.
Melmotte and the two Grendalls had just come over from their work
in the square, and the financier was full of the priest's visit to
him (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>). Madame Melmotte was there, and Miss Longestaffe, who was to be
sent for by her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) friend Lady Monogram that afternoon,--and, after
they had sat down, Marie came in. Nidderdale got up and shook hands
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>),--of course as though nothing had happened. Marie, putting
a brave face upon it, struggling hard in the midst of very real
difficulties, succeeded in saying an ordinary word or two. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
position was uncomfortable. A girl who has run away with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover
and has been brought back again by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends, must for a time find
it difficult to appear in society with ease. But when a girl has run
away without her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover,--has run away expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover to go with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and has then been brought back, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover not having stirred,
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) state of mind must be peculiarly harassing. But Marie's courage
was good, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lunch even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) sat next to Lord
Nidderdale.

<p/>Melmotte was very gracious to the young lord. <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever hear
anything like that, Nidderdale?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, speaking of the priest's
visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mad as a hatter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Lord Alfred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know much about his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) madness. I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had
been sent by the Archbishop of Westminster. Why don't we have an
Archbishop of Westminster when they've got one? I shall have to see
to that when I'm in the House. I suppose there is a bishop, isn't
there, Alfred?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>Alfred shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``There's a Dean, I know, for
I called on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) told me flat he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) wouldn't vote for me. I thought
all those parsons were Conservatives. It didn't occur to me that the
fellow had come from the Archbishop, or I would have been more civil
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mad as a hatter;--nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Lord Alfred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>), Nidderdale. It would have been as good as
a play to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you didn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) to the dinner, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``D-- the dinner, I'm sick of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``We must
go back again, Alfred. Those fellows will never get along if they are
not looked after. Come, Miles. Ladies, I shall expect you to be ready
at exactly a quarter before eight. His (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) Imperial Majesty is to arrive
at eight precisely, and I must be there to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>). You, Madame,
will have to receive your guests in the drawing-room.''  (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div>The ladies
went up-stairs, and Lord Nidderdale followed them. Miss Longestaffe
soon took her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) departure, alleging that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) couldn't keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) dear
friend Lady Monogram waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>). Then there fell upon Madame
Melmotte the duty of leaving the young people together, a duty which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) found a great difficulty in performing. After all that had
happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) did not know how to get up and go out of the room. As
regarded herself, the troubles of these troublous times were becoming
almost too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had no pleasure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) grandeur,--and
probably no belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) husband's achievements. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) present
duty to assist in getting Marie married to this young man, and that
duty she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could only do by going away. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did not know how to
get out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) expressed in fluent French her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) abhorrence
of the Emperor, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) might be allowed to remain in
bed during the whole evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) liked Nidderdale better than any
one else who came there, and wondered at Marie's preference for Sir
Felix. Lord Nidderdale assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) that nothing was so easy as kings
and emperors, because no one was expected to say anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) sighed
and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) head, and wished again that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) might be allowed to go
to bed. Marie, who was by degrees plucking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) courage, declared
that though kings and emperors were horrors as a rule, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) thought an
Emperor of China would be good fun. Then Madame Melmotte also plucked
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) courage, rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) chair, and made straight for the
door. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma, where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, also rising. Madame
Melmotte, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) handkerchief up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) face, declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
was being absolutely destroyed by a toothache. <div class="bookquote">``I must see if I can't
do something for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, hurrying to the door. But Lord
Nidderdale was too quick for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) back to it.
<div class="bookquote">``That's a shame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother has gone on purpose that I may speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
lordship. <div class="bookquote">``Why should you grudge me the opportunity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div><p/>Marie returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) chair and again seated herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) also had
thought much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own position since her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) return from Liverpool. Why
had Sir Felix not been there? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) not come since her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) return,
and, at any rate, endeavoured to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) made no attempt
to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)? Had it been her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) part to do so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would have found
a hundred ways of getting at him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) absolutely had walked inside
the garden of the square on Sunday morning, and had contrived to
leave a gate open on each side. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had made no sign. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father
had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not gone to Liverpool--and had assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never intended to go. Melmotte had been very savage with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) about the money, and had loudly accused Sir Felix of stealing it.
The repayment he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) never mentioned,--a piece of honesty, indeed, which
had showed no virtue on the part of Sir Felix. But even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
spent the money, why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) not man enough to come and say so?
Marie could have forgiven that fault,--could have forgiven even the
gambling and the drunkenness which had caused the failure of the
enterprise on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) side, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had had the courage to come and confess
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). What she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could not forgive was continued indifference,--or
the cowardice which forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to show himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had more than
once almost doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) love, though as a lover he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been better
than Nidderdale. But now, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was ready to
consent that the thing should be considered as over between them.
No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had more than once almost
determined to do so. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had reflected that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) really
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was quite ready to run away with
a lover, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would not fling herself at
a man's head. Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had done nothing,--beyond leaving the
garden gates open on the Sunday morning.

<p/>But what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to do with herself? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) also felt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) knew not why,
that the present turmoil of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father's life might be brought to an
end by some dreadful convulsion. No girl could be more anxious to be
married and taken away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home. If Sir Felix did not appear
again, what should she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had seen enough of life to be aware
that suitors would come,--would come as long as that convulsion was
staved off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did not suppose that her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) journey to Liverpool would
frighten all the men away. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had thought that it would put an
end to Lord Nidderdale's courtship; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father had commanded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) by the shoulders, to accept Lord Nidderdale when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
should come on Sunday, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had replied by expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) assurance
that Lord Nidderdale would never be seen at that house any more. On
the Sunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had not come; but here he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was now, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
back to the drawing-room door, and cutting off her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) retreat with the
evident intention of renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) suit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was determined at any
rate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would speak up. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you should have to
say to me, Lord Nidderdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't I have something to say to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--. Oh, you know why. Besides, I've told you ever so often,
my lord. I thought a gentleman would never go on with a lady when the
lady has told him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) liked somebody else better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I don't believe you when you tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; that is impudent! You may believe it then. I think I've given
you reason to believe it, at any rate.''

me say what I've got to say,--out at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that matter? If it comes to that, I knew ever so many
people before I knew you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you were engaged to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You broke it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me for a moment or two. I know I did. Or, rather, your
father and my father broke it off for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we had cared for each other they couldn't have broken it off.
Nobody in the world could break me off as long as I felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
really loved me;--not if they were to cut me in pieces. But you
didn't care, not a bit. You did it just because your father told you.
And so did I. But I know better than that now. You never cared for
me a bit more than for the old woman at the crossing. You thought
I didn't understand;--but I did. And now you've come again;--because
your father has told you again. And you'd better go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a great deal of truth in what you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all true, my lord. Every word of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you wouldn't call me my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are a lord, and therefore I shall call you so. I never
called you anything else when they pretended that we were to be
married, and you never asked me. I never even knew what your name was
till I looked it out in the book after I had consented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is truth in what you say;--but it isn't true now. How was I to
love you when I had seen so little of you? I do love you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do love you now, and I think you'd find that I should be truer

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) go, Lord Nidderdale?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) asked the question with an

well tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Marie;--that's just what I ought not to do. But he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ought to tell
you. Do you really in your heart believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) means to come back
to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said, sobbing. <div class="bookquote">``I do love him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>);--I do indeed. I
know that you are good-natured. You are more good-natured than he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did like me. You never did;--no; not a bit. It isn't true.
I ain't a fool. I know. No;--go away. I won't let you now. I don't
care what he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is; I'll be true to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). Go away, Lord Nidderdale. You
oughtn't to go on like that because papa and mamma let you come here.
I didn't let you come. I don't want you to come. No;--I won't say
any kind word to you. I love Sir Felix Carbury better--than any
person--in all the world. There! I don't know whether you call that
kind, but it's true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say good-bye to me, Marie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mind saying good-bye. Good-bye, my lord; and don't come
any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall. Good-bye, Marie. You'll find the difference between
me and him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) leave, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) sauntered away he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
thought that upon the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had prospered, considering the extreme
difficulties under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had laboured in carrying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) suit.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s quite a different sort of girl from what I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
said to himself. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s awfully jolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div><p/>Marie, when the interview was over, walked about the room almost in
dismay. It was borne in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) by degrees that Sir Felix Carbury
was not at all points quite as nice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
beauty there was no doubt; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) for no other
good quality. Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) not come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)? Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) not show some
pluck? Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) the truth? She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had quite believed Lord
Nidderdale when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) knew the cause that had kept Sir
Felix from going to Liverpool. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), too, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) said that it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) business to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). But the reason,
let it be what it might, must, if known, be prejudicial to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) love.
Lord Nidderdale was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) thought, not at all beautiful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had a
common-place, rough face, with a turn-up nose, high cheek bones, no
especial complexion, sandy-coloured whiskers, and bright laughing
eyes,--not at all an Adonis such as her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) imagination had painted. But
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) had only made love at first as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) had attempted to do it now,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would have submitted herself to be cut in pieces
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER LVIII.

<p/>MR. SQUERCUM IS EMPLOYED.


<p/>While these things were being done in Bruton Street and Grosvenor
Square horrid rumours were prevailing in the City and spreading from
the City westwards to the House of Commons, which was sitting this
Monday afternoon with a prospect of an adjournment at seven o'clock
in consequence of the banquet to be given to the Emperor. It is
difficult to explain the exact nature of this rumour, as it was not
thoroughly understood by those who propagated it. But it is certainly
the case that the word forgery was whispered by more than one pair of
lips.

<p/>Many of Melmotte's staunchest supporters thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was very
wrong not to show himself that day in the City. What good could he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) do
pottering about among the chairs and benches in the banqueting room?
There were people to manage that kind of thing. In such an affair it
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) business to do simply as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was told, and to pay the bill. It
was not as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were giving a little dinner to a friend, and had
to see himself that the wine was brought up in good order. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) work
was in the City; and at such a time as this and in such a crisis
as this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should have been in the City. Men will whisper forgery
behind a man's back who would not dare even to think it before his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
face.

<p/>Of this particular rumour our young friend Dolly Longestaffe was the
parent. With unhesitating resolution, nothing awed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father,
Dolly had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) attorney, Mr. Squercum, immediately after that
Friday on which Mr. Longestaffe first took his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) seat at the Railway
Board. Dolly was possessed of fine qualities, but it must be owned
that veneration was not one of them. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know why Mr. Melmotte
is to be different from anybody else,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father.
<div class="bookquote">``When I buy a thing and don't pay for it, it is because I haven't got
the tin, and I suppose it's about the same with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). It's all right,
no doubt, but I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should have got hold of the place
till the money was paid down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father. <div class="bookquote">``You think you
understand everything, when you really understand nothing at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm slow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't comprehend these things.
But then Squercum does. When a fellow is stupid himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ought to
have a sharp fellow to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll ruin me and yourself too, if you go to such a man as that.
Why can't you trust Mr. Bideawhile? Slow and Bideawhile have been
the family lawyers for a century.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Dolly made some remark as to the
old family advisers which was by no means pleasing to the father's
ears, and went his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way. The father knew his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) boy, and knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
boy would go to Squercum. All he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could himself do was to press Mr.
Melmotte for the money with what importunity he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could assume. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
wrote a timid letter to Mr. Melmotte, which had no result; and then,
on the next Friday, again went into the City and there encountered
perturbation of spirit and sheer loss of time,--as the reader has
already learned.

<p/>Squercum was a thorn in the side of all the Bideawhiles. Mr. Slow had
been gathered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fathers, but of the Bideawhiles there were three
in the business, a father and two sons, to whom Squercum was a pest
and a musquito, a running sore and a skeleton in the cupboard. It
was not only in reference to Mr. Longestaffe's affairs that they
knew Squercum. The Bideawhiles piqued themselves on the decorous and
orderly transaction of their business. It had grown to be a rule in
the house that anything done quickly must be done badly. They never
were in a hurry for money, and they expected their clients never to
be in a hurry for work. Squercum was the very opposite to this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
had established himself, without predecessors and without a partner,
and we may add without capital, at a little office in Fetter Lane,
and had there made a character for getting things done after a
marvellous and new fashion. And it was said of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was fairly
honest, though it must be owned that among the Bideawhiles of the
profession this was not the character which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) bore. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) did sharp
things no doubt, and had no hesitation in supporting the interests
of sons against those of their fathers. In more than one case he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had
computed for a young heir the exact value of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) share in a property
as compared to that of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) father, and had come into hostile contact
with many family Bideawhiles. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been closely watched. There were
some who, no doubt, would have liked to crush a man who was at once
so clever, and so pestilential. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not as yet been crushed,
and had become quite in vogue with elder sons. Some three years since
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name had been mentioned to Dolly by a friend who had for years
been at war with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, and Squercum had been quite a comfort to
Dolly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) was a mean-looking little man, not yet above forty, who always
wore a stiff light-coloured cotton cravat, an old dress coat, a
coloured dingy waistcoat, and light trousers of some hue different
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) waistcoat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) generally had on dirty shoes and gaiters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
was light haired, with light whiskers, with putty-formed features, a
squat nose, a large mouth, and very bright blue eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) looked as
unlike the normal Bideawhile of the profession as a man could be; and
it must be owned, though an attorney, would hardly have been taken
for a gentleman from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) personal appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very quick,
and active in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) motions, absolutely doing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) law work himself,
and trusting to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) three or four juvenile clerks for little more
than scrivener's labour. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seldom or never came to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) office on a
Saturday, and many among his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) enemies said that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a Jew. What
evil will not a rival say to stop the flow of grist to the mill of
the hated one? But this report Squercum rather liked, and assisted.
They who knew the inner life of the little man declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
kept a horse and hunted down in Essex on Saturday, doing a bit of
gardening in the summer months;--and they said also that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made up
for this by working hard all Sunday. Such was Mr. Squercum,--a sign,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) way, that the old things are being changed.

<p/>Squercum sat at a desk, covered with papers in chaotic confusion, on
a chair which moved on a pivot. His (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) desk was against the wall, and
when clients came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) turned himself sharp round, sticking out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) dirty shoes, throwing himself back till his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) body was an inclined
plane, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) hands thrust into his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) pockets. In this attitude he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
would listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) client's story, and would himself speak as little
as possible. It was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) instructions that Dolly had insisted on
getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) share of the purchase money for Pickering into his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) own
hands, so that the incumbrance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) own property might be paid
off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) now listened as Dolly told him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) of the delay in the payment.
<div class="bookquote">``Melmotte's at Pickering?''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>asked the attorney. Then Dolly informed
him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) how the tradesmen of the great financier had already half knocked
down the house. Squercum still listened, and promised to look to it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) did ask what authority Dolly had given for the surrender of the
title-deeds. Dolly declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had given authority for the sale,
but none for the surrender. His (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) father, some time since, had put
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) signature, a letter, prepared in Mr. Bideawhile's
office, which Dolly said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had refused even to read, and
certainly had not signed. Squercum again said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)'d look to it,
and bowed Dolly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) room. <div class="bookquote">``They've got him (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) to sign something
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) was tight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>said Squercum to himself, knowing something of
the habits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) client. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) father did it, or old
Bideawhile, or Melmotte himself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>Mr. Squercum was inclined to think
that Bideawhile would not have done it, that Melmotte could have had
no opportunity, and that the father must have been the practitioner.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not the trick of a pompous old fool either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Squercum,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) soliloquy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) went to work, however, making himself detestably
odious among the very respectable clerks in Mr. Bideawhile's
office,--men who considered themselves to be altogether superior to
Squercum himself in professional standing.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Mr. Squercum in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) office.-RSB-


<p/>And now there came this rumour which was so far particular in
its details that it inferred the forgery, of which it accused Mr.
Melmotte, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mode of acquiring the Pickering property. The
nature of the forgery was of course described in various ways,--as
was also the signature said to have been forged. But there were
many who believed, or almost believed, that something wrong had
been done,--that some great fraud had been committed; and in
connection with this it was ascertained,--by some as a matter of
certainty,--that the Pickering estate had been already mortgaged
by Melmotte to its full value at an assurance office. In such a
transaction there would be nothing dishonest; but as this place
had been bought for the great man's own family use, and not as a
speculation, even this report of the mortgage tended to injure his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
credit. And then, as the day went on, other tidings were told as to
other properties. Houses in the East-end of London were said to have
been bought and sold, without payment of the purchase money as to the
buying, and with receipt of the purchase money as to the selling.

<p/>It was certainly true that Squercum himself had seen the letter in
Mr. Bideawhile's office which conveyed to the father's lawyer the
son's sanction for the surrender of the title-deeds, and that that
letter, prepared in Mr. Bideawhile's office, purported to have
Dolly's signature. Squercum said but little, remembering that his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
client was not always clear in the morning as to anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had done
on the preceding evening. But the signature, though it was scrawled
as Dolly always scrawled it, was not like the scrawl of a drunken
man.

<p/>The letter was said to have been sent to Mr. Bideawhile's office with
other letters and papers, direct from old Mr. Longestaffe. Such was
the statement made at first to Mr. Squercum by the Bideawhile party,
who at that moment had no doubt of the genuineness of the letter or
of the accuracy of their statement. Then Squercum saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) client
again, and returned to the charge at Bideawhile's office, with the
positive assurance that the signature was a forgery. Dolly, when
questioned by Squercum, quite admitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) propensity to be <div class="bookquote">``tight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had no reticence, no feeling of disgrace on such matters. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
had signed no letter when he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) was tight. <div class="bookquote">``Never did such a thing in my
life, and nothing could make me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm never tight except
at the club, and the letter couldn't have been there. I'll be drawn
and quartered if I ever signed it. That's flat.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Dolly was intent on
going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) father at once, on going to Melmotte at once, on going
to Bideawhile's at once, and making there <div class="bookquote">``no end of a row,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>--but
Squercum stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We'll just ferret this thing out quietly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>said Squercum, who perhaps thought that there would be high honour
in discovering the peccadillos of so great a man as Mr. Melmotte. Mr.
Longestaffe, the father, had heard nothing of the matter till the
Saturday after his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) last interview with Melmotte in the City. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
then called at Bideawhile's office in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and had
been shown the letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) declared at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had never sent
the letter to Mr. Bideawhile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had begged his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) son to sign the
letter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) son had refused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) did not at that moment distinctly
remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had done with the letter unsigned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>)
had left it with the other papers; but it was possible that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) son
might have taken it away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) acknowledged that at the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had
been both angry and unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) didn't think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) could have sent
the letter back unsigned,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) was not sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had more than
once been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) own study in Bruton Street since Mr. Melmotte had
occupied the house,--by that gentleman's leave,--having left various
papers there under his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own lock and key. Indeed it had been matter
of agreement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should have access to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own study when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) let
the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought it probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have kept back the
unsigned letter, and have kept it under lock and key, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sent
away the other papers. Then reference was made to Mr. Longestaffe's
own letter to the lawyer, and it was found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had not even
alluded to that which his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son had been asked to sign; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had
said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own usually pompous style, that Mr. Longestaffe, junior,
was still prone to create unsubstantial difficulties. Mr. Bideawhile
was obliged to confess that there had been a want of caution among
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) own people. This allusion to the creation of difficulties by
Dolly, accompanied, as it was supposed to have been, by Dolly's
letter doing away with all difficulties, should have attracted
notice. Dolly's letter must have come in a separate envelope; but
such envelope could not be found, and the circumstance was not
remembered by the clerk. The clerk who had prepared the letter for
Dolly's signature represented himself as having been quite satisfied
when the letter came again beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) notice with Dolly's well-known
signature.

<p/>Such were the facts as far as they were known at Messrs. Slow and
Bideawhile's office,--from whom no slightest rumour emanated; and as
they had been in part collected by Squercum, who was probably less
prudent. The Bideawhiles were still perfectly sure that Dolly had
signed the letter, believing the young man to be quite incapable of
knowing on any day what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done on the day before.

<p/>Squercum was quite sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) client had not signed it. And it
must be owned on Dolly's behalf that his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) manner on this occasion was
qualified to convince. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) said to Squercum; <div class="bookquote">``it's easy saying
that I'm lack-a-daisical. But I know when I'm lack-a-daisical and
when I'm not. Awake or asleep, drunk or sober, I never signed that
letter.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Squercum believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>).

<p/>It would be hard to say how the rumour first got into the City on
this Monday morning. Though the elder Longestaffe had first heard
of the matter only on the previous Saturday, Mr. Squercum had been
at work for above a week. Mr. Squercum's little matter alone might
hardly have attracted the attention which certainly was given on this
day to Mr. Melmotte's private affairs;--but other facts coming to
light assisted Squercum's views. A great many shares of the South
Central Pacific and Mexican Railway had been thrown upon the market,
all of which had passed through the hands of Mr. Cohenlupe;--and Mr.
Cohenlupe in the City had been all to Mr. Melmotte as Lord Alfred had
been at the West End. Then there was the mortgage of this Pickering
property, for which the money certainly had not been paid; and there
was the traffic with half a street of houses near the Commercial
Road, by which a large sum of money had come into Mr. Melmotte's
hands. It might, no doubt, all be right. There were many who thought
that it would all be right. There were not a few who expressed the
most thorough contempt for these rumours. But it was felt to be a
pity that Mr. Melmotte was not in the City.

<p/>This was the day of the dinner. The Lord Mayor had even made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>)
mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) would not go to the dinner. What one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) brother
aldermen said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) about leaving others in the lurch might be quite
true; but, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) lordship remarked, Melmotte was a commercial man,
and as these were commercial transactions it behoved the Lord Mayor
of London to be more careful than other men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had always had his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
doubts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would not go. Others of the chosen few of the City
who had been honoured with commands to meet the Emperor resolved
upon absenting themselves unless the Lord Mayor went. The affair was
very much discussed, and there were no less than six declared City
defaulters. At the last moment a seventh was taken ill and sent a
note to Miles Grendall excusing himself, which was thrust into the
secretary's hands just as the Emperor arrived.

<p/>But a reverse worse than this took place;--a defalcation more
injurious to the Melmotte interests generally even than that which
was caused either by the prudence or by the cowardice of the City
Magnates. The House of Commons, at its meeting, had heard the tidings
in an exaggerated form. It was whispered about that Melmotte had
been detected in forging the deed of conveyance of a large property,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had already been visited by policemen. By some it was
believed that the Great Financier would lie in the hands of the
Philistines while the Emperor of China was being fed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) house.
In the third edition of the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>came out a mysterious
paragraph which nobody could understand but they who had known all
about it before. <div class="bookquote">``A rumour is prevalent that frauds to an enormous
extent have been committed by a gentleman whose name we are
particularly unwilling to mention. If it be so it is indeed
remarkable that they should have come to light at the present moment.
We cannot trust ourselves to say more than this.''  (<font color='red'><b>a swindler</b></font>)</div>No one wishes
to dine with a swindler. No one likes even to have dined with a
swindler,--especially to have dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>) at a time when his (<font color='blue'><b>swindler</b></font>)
swindling was known or suspected. The Emperor of China no doubt was
going to dine with this man. The motions of Emperors are managed with
such ponderous care that it was held to be impossible now to save
the country from what would doubtless be felt to be a disgrace if
it should hereafter turn out that a forger had been solicited to
entertain the imperial guest of the country. Nor was the thing as yet
so far certain as to justify such a charge, were it possible. But
many men were unhappy in their minds. How would the story be told
hereafter if Melmotte should be allowed to play out his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) game of host
to the Emperor, and be arrested for forgery as soon as the Eastern
Monarch should have left his (<font color='blue'><b>Monarch</b></font>) house? How would the brother of the Sun
like the remembrance of the banquet which he (<font color='blue'><b>Monarch</b></font>) had been instructed
to honour with his (<font color='blue'><b>Monarch</b></font>) presence? How would it tell in all the foreign
newspapers, in New York, in Paris, and Vienna, that this man who
had been cast forth from the United States, from France, and from
Austria had been selected as the great and honourable type of British
Commerce? There were those in the House who thought that the absolute
consummation of the disgrace might yet be avoided, and who were of
opinion that the dinner should be <div class="bookquote">``postponed.''  (<font color='red'><b>House/Carbury Manor House/Manor House</b></font>)</div>The leader of the
Opposition had a few words on the subject with the Prime Minister.
<div class="bookquote">``It is the merest rumour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prime Minister</b></font>)</div>said the Prime Minister. <div class="bookquote">``I have inquired,
and there is nothing to justify me in thinking that the charges can
be substantiated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say that the story is believed in the City.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not feel myself justified in acting upon such a report. The
Prince might probably find it impossible not to go. Where should we
be if Mr. Melmotte to-morrow were able to prove the whole to be a
calumny, and to show that the thing had been got up with a view of
influencing the election at Westminster? The dinner must certainly go
on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will go yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most assuredly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prime Minister</b></font>)</div>said the Prime Minister. <div class="bookquote">``And I hope that you will
keep me in countenance.''  (<font color='red'><b>antagonist</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) political antagonist declared with
a smile that at such a crisis he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) would not desert his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) honourable
friend;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) could not answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) followers. There was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)
admitted, a strong feeling among the leaders of the Conservative
party of distrust in Melmotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) considered it probable that among
his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) friends who had been invited there would be some who would be
unwilling to meet even the Emperor of China on the existing terms.
<div class="bookquote">``They should remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prime Minister</b></font>)</div>said the Prime Minister, <div class="bookquote">``that they are also
to meet their own Prince, and that empty seats on such an occasion
will be a dishonour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Prime Minister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just at present I can only answer for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>said the leader of
the Opposition.--At that moment even the Prime Minister was much
disturbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) mind; but in such emergencies a Prime Minister can
only choose the least of two evils. To have taken the Emperor to dine
with a swindler would be very bad; but to desert him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>), and to stop the
coming of the Emperor and all the Princes on a false rumour, would be
worse.




<p/>CHAPTER LIX.

<p/>THE DINNER.


<p/>It does sometimes occur in life that an unambitious man, who is in no
degree given to enterprises, who would fain be safe, is driven by the
cruelty of circumstances into a position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must choose a
side, and in which, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no certain guide as to which side
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should choose, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be disgraced if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
take the wrong side. This was felt as a hardship by many who were
quite suddenly forced to make up their mind whether they would go to
Melmotte's dinner, or join themselves to the faction of those who had
determined to stay away although they had accepted invitations. Some
there were not without a suspicion that the story against Melmotte
had been got up simply as an electioneering trick,--so that Mr. Alf
might carry the borough on the next day. As a dodge for an election
this might be very well, but any who might be deterred by such
a manoeuvre from meeting the Emperor and supporting the Prince
would surely be marked men. And none of the wives, when they were
consulted, seemed to care a straw whether Melmotte was a swindler or
not. Would the Emperor and the Princes and Princesses be there? This
was the only question which concerned them. They did not care whether
Melmotte was arrested at the dinner or after the dinner, so long
as they, with others, could show their diamonds in the presence of
eastern and western royalty. But yet,--what a fiasco would it be,
if at this very instant of time the host should be apprehended for
common forgery! The great thing was to ascertain whether others were
going. If a hundred or more out of the two hundred were to be absent
how dreadful would be the position of those who were present! And how
would the thing go if at the last moment the Emperor should be kept
away? The Prime Minister had decided that the Emperor and the Prince
should remain altogether in ignorance of the charges which were
preferred against the man; but of that these doubters were unaware.
There was but little time for a man to go about town and pick up the
truth from those who were really informed; and questions were asked
in an uncomfortable and restless manner. <div class="bookquote">``Is your Grace going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupton/Lionel Lupton</b></font>)</div>said
Lionel Lupton to the Duchess of Stevenage,--having left the House
and gone into the park between six and seven to pick up some hints
among those who were known to have been invited. The Duchess was
Lord Alfred's sister, and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was going. <div class="bookquote">``I usually keep
engagements when I make them, Mr. Lupton,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) had
been assured by Lord Alfred not a quarter of an hour before that
everything was as straight as a die. Lord Alfred had not then even
heard of the rumour. But ultimately both Lionel Lupton and Beauchamp
Beauclerk attended the dinner. They had received special tickets as
supporters of Mr. Melmotte at the election,--out of the scanty number
allotted to that gentleman himself,--and they thought themselves
bound in honour to be there. But they, with their leader, and one
other influential member of the party, were all who at last came as
the political friends of the candidate for Westminster. The existing
ministers were bound to attend to the Emperor and the Prince. But
members of the Opposition, by their presence, would support the man
and the politician, and both as a man and as a politician they were
ashamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>).

<p/>When Melmotte arrived at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife and daughter he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had heard nothing of the matter. That a man so vexed with affairs of
money, so laden with cares, encompassed by such dangers, should be
free from suspicion and fear it is impossible to imagine. That such
burdens should be borne at all is a wonder to those whose shoulders
have never been broadened for such work;--as is the strength of the
blacksmith's arm to men who have never wielded a hammer. Surely his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>)
whole life must have been a life of terrors! But of any special peril
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) was at that moment subject, or of any embarrassment which
might affect the work of the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) knew nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>)
wife in the drawing-room and himself in the hall, and arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>)
immediate satellites around him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>),--among whom were included the two
Grendalls, young Nidderdale, and Mr. Cohenlupe,--with a feeling of
gratified glory. Nidderdale down at the House had heard the rumour,
but had determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) would not as yet fly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) colours.
Cohenlupe had also come up from the House, where no one had spoken to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>). Though grievously frightened during the last fortnight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) had
not dared to be on the wing as yet. And, indeed, to what clime could
such a bird as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) fly in safety? He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) had not only heard,--but also
knew very much, and was not prepared to enjoy the feast. Since they
had been in the hall Miles had spoken dreadful words to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) father.
<div class="bookquote">``You've heard about it; haven't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>whispered Miles. Lord Alfred,
remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) sister's question, became almost pale, but declared
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) had heard nothing. <div class="bookquote">``They're saying all manner of things in
the City;--forgery and heaven knows what. The Lord Mayor is not
coming.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>Lord Alfred made no reply. It was the philosophy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
life that misfortunes when they came should be allowed to settle
themselves. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was unhappy.

<p/>The grand arrivals were fairly punctual, and the very grand people
all came. The unfortunate Emperor,--we must consider a man to be
unfortunate who is compelled to go through such work as this,--with
impassible and awful dignity, was marshalled into the room on the
ground floor, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) and other royalties were to be marshalled
back into the banqueting hall. Melmotte, bowing to the ground, walked
backwards before him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and was probably taken by the Emperor for some
Court Master of the Ceremonies especially selected to walk backwards
on this occasion. The Princes had all shaken hands with their host,
and the Princesses had bowed graciously. Nothing of the rumour had
as yet been whispered in royal palaces. Besides royalty the company
allowed to enter the room downstairs was very select. The Prime
Minister, one archbishop, two duchesses, and an ex-governor of
India with whose features the Emperor was supposed to be peculiarly
familiar, were alone there. The remainder of the company, under the
superintendence of Lord Alfred, were received in the drawing-room
above. Everything was going on well, and they who had come and had
thought of not coming were proud of their wisdom.

<p/>But when the company was seated at dinner the deficiencies were
visible enough, and were unfortunate. Who does not know the effect
made by the absence of one or two from a table intended for ten
or twelve,--how grievous are the empty places, how destructive of
the outward harmony and grace which the hostess has endeavoured to
preserve are these interstices, how the lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wrath declares to
herself that those guilty ones shall never have another opportunity
of filling a seat at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) table? Some twenty, most of whom had been
asked to bring their wives, had slunk from their engagements, and
the empty spaces were sufficient to declare a united purpose. A week
since it had been understood that admission for the evening could not
be had for love or money, and that a seat at the dinner-table was as
a seat at some banquet of the gods! Now it looked as though the room
were but half-filled. There were six absences from the City. Another
six of Mr. Melmotte's own political party were away. The archbishops
and the bishop were there, because bishops never hear worldly tidings
till after other people;--but that very Master of the Buckhounds for
whom so much pressure had been made did not come. Two or three peers
were absent, and so also was that editor who had been chosen to
fill Mr. Alf's place. One poet, two painters, and a philosopher had
received timely notice at their clubs, and had gone home. The three
independent members of the House of Commons for once agreed in their
policy, and would not lend the encouragement of their presence to a
man suspected of forgery. Nearly forty places were vacant when the
business of the dinner commenced.

<p/>Melmotte had insisted that Lord Alfred should sit next to himself at
the big table, and having had the objectionable bar removed, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) own chair shoved one step nearer to the centre, had carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>).
point. With the anxiety natural to such an occasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) glanced
repeatedly round the hall, and of course became aware that many were
absent. <div class="bookquote">``How is it that there are so many places empty?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) said to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) faithful Achates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Achates, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) head, steadfastly refusing to
look round upon the hall.

<p/>Melmotte waited awhile, then looked round again, and asked the
question in another shape: <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't there been some mistake about the
numbers? There's room for ever so many more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Lord Alfred, who was unhappy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) mind, and
repenting himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) had ever seen Mr. Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the deuce do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>whispered Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``You've been at it
from the beginning and ought to know. When I wanted to ask Brehgert,
you swore that you couldn't squeeze a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't say anything about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Lord Alfred, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) eyes fixed
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) plate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be d-- if I don't find out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``There's either
some horrible blunder, or else there's been imposition. I don't see
quite clearly. Where's Sir Gregory Gribe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't come, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where's the Lord Mayor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Melmotte, in spite of royalty, was now
sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face turned round upon the hall. <div class="bookquote">``I know all their
places, and I know where they were put. Have you seen the Lord
Mayor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I haven't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was to come. What's the meaning of it, Alfred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know anything about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head but would not, for
even a moment, look round upon the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where's Mr. Killegrew,--and Sir David Boss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Killegrew/Killegrew</b></font>)</div>Mr. Killegrew and
Sir David were gentlemen of high standing, and destined for important
offices in the Conservative party. <div class="bookquote">``There are ever so many people not
here. Why, there's not above half of them down the room. What's up,
Alfred? I must know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you I know nothing. I could not make them come.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>Lord
Alfred's answers were made not only with a surly voice, but also with
a surly heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was keenly alive to the failure, and alive also to
the feeling that the failure would partly be attached to himself.
At the present moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was anxious to avoid observation, and it
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) that Melmotte, by the frequency and impetuosity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
questions, was drawing special attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you go on making
a row,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall go away.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Melmotte looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Just sit quiet and let the thing go on. You'll know all
about it soon enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>This was hardly the way to give Mr. Melmotte
peace of mind. For a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did sit quiet. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) got up and
moved down the hall behind the guests.

<p/>In the meantime, Imperial Majesty and Royalties of various
denominations ate their dinner, without probably observing those
Banquo's seats. As the Emperor talked Manchoo only, and as there was
no one present who could even interpret Manchoo into English,--the
imperial interpreter condescending only to interpret Manchoo into
ordinary Chinese which had to be reinterpreted,--it was not within
his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) Imperial Majesty's power to have much conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>)
neighbours. And as his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) neighbours on each side of him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) were all
cousins and husbands, and brothers and wives, who saw each constantly
under, let us presume, more comfortable circumstances, they had not
very much to say to each other. Like most of us, they had their
duties to do, and, like most of us, probably found their duties
irksome. The brothers and sisters and cousins were used to it; but
that awful Emperor, solid, solemn, and silent, must, if the spirit of
an Eastern Emperor be at all like that of a Western man, have had a
weary time of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) sat there for more than two hours, awful, solid,
solemn, and silent, not eating very much,--for this was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)
manner of eating; nor drinking very much,--for this was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)
manner of drinking; but wondering, no doubt, within his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) own awful
bosom, at the changes which were coming when an Emperor of China was
forced, by outward circumstances, to sit and hear this buzz of voices
and this clatter of knives and forks. <div class="bookquote">``And this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) must have said
to himself, <div class="bookquote">``is what they call royalty in the West!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If a prince of
our own was forced, for the good of the country, to go among some far
distant outlandish people, and there to be poked in the ribs, and
slapped on the back all round, the change to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) could hardly be so
great.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Sir Gregory?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, in a hoarse whisper, bending
over the chair of a City friend. It was old Todd, the senior partner
of Todd, Brehgert, and Goldsheiner. Mr. Todd was a very wealthy man,
and had a considerable following in the City.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregory</b></font>) here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Todd/Mr. Todd</b></font>)</div>said Todd,--knowing very well who had come from the
City and who had declined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--and the Lord Mayor's not come;--nor Postlethwaite, nor Bunter.
What's the meaning of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Todd/Mr. Todd</b></font>)</div><p/>Todd looked first at one neighbour and then at another before he (<font color='blue'><b>Todd</b></font>)
answered. <div class="bookquote">``I'm here, that's all I can say, Mr. Melmotte; and I've
had a very good dinner. They who haven't come, have lost a very good
dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a weight upon Melmotte's mind of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could not rid
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew from the old man's manner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew also from
Lord Alfred's manner, that there was something which each of them
could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was unable to make the men open
their mouths. And yet it might be so important to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should
know! <div class="bookquote">``It's very odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that gentlemen should promise to
come and then stay away. There were hundreds anxious to be present
whom I should have been glad to welcome, if I had known that there
would be room. I think it is very odd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Todd/Mr. Todd</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Todd, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Todd</b></font>) attention to the plate before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Todd</b></font>).

<p/>Melmotte had lately seen much of Beauchamp Beauclerk, in reference
to the coming election. Passing back up the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found the
gentleman with a vacant seat on one side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). There were many
vacant seats in this part of the room, as the places for the
Conservative gentlemen had been set apart together. There Mr.
Melmotte seated himself for a minute, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might get the
truth from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) new ally. Prudence should have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) silent. Let
the cause of these desertions have been what it might, it ought to
have been clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could apply no remedy to it now. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was bewildered and dismayed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind within him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was changing
at every moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was now striving to trust to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) arrogance and
declaring that nothing should cow him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). And then again he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was so cowed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was ready to creep to any one for assistance. Personally,
Mr. Beauclerk had disliked the man greatly. Among the vulgar, loud
upstarts whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>) had known, Melmotte was the vulgarest, the loudest,
and the most arrogant. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had taken the business of Melmotte's
election in hand, and considered himself bound to stand by Melmotte
till that was over; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was now the guest of the man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
house, and was therefore constrained to courtesy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife was
sitting by him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at once introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to Mr. Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``You
have a wonderful assemblage here, Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady,
looking up at the royal table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, yes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) Majesty the Emperor has been pleased to
intimate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) has been much gratified.'' (<font color='red'><b>the Emperor</b></font>)</div>--Had the Emperor in truth
said so, no one who looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) could have believed his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) imperial
word.--<div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me, Mr. Beauclerk, why those other gentlemen are
not here? It looks very odd; does it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah; you mean Killegrew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Mr. Killegrew and Sir David Boss, and the whole lot. I made a
particular point of their coming. I said I wouldn't have the dinner
at all unless they were to be asked. They were going to make it a
Government thing; but I said no. I insisted on the leaders of our own
party; and now they're not here. I know the cards were sent;--and, by
George, I have their answers, saying they'd come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose some of them are engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beauclerk/Beauchamp Beauclerk/Mr. Beauchamp Beauclerk</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beauclerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Engaged! What business has a man to accept one engagement and
then take another? And, if so, why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) write and make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
excuses? No, Mr. Beauclerk, that won't go down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm here, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beauclerk/Beauchamp Beauclerk/Mr. Beauchamp Beauclerk</b></font>)</div>said Beauclerk, making the very answer that
had occurred to Mr. Todd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, you're here. You're all right. But what is it, Mr.
Beauclerk? There's something up, and you must have heard.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beauclerk/Beauchamp Beauclerk/Mr. Beauchamp Beauclerk</b></font>)</div>And so
it was clear to Mr. Beauclerk that the man knew nothing about it
himself. If there was anything wrong, Melmotte was not aware that
the wrong had been discovered. <div class="bookquote">``Is it anything about the election
to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One never can tell what is actuating people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beauclerk/Beauchamp Beauclerk/Mr. Beauchamp Beauclerk</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beauclerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you know anything about the matter I think you ought to tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing except that the ballot will be taken to-morrow. You
and I have got nothing more to do in the matter except to wait the
result.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; I suppose it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, rising and going
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) seat. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew that things were not all right. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
political friends only been absent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might have attributed their
absence to some political cause which would not have touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
deeply. But the treachery of the Lord Mayor and of Sir Gregory Gribe
was a blow. For another hour after he (<font color='blue'><b>Gribe</b></font>) had returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gribe</b></font>) place, the
Emperor sat solemn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) chair; and then, at some signal given by
some one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) was withdrawn. The ladies had already left the room
about half an hour. According to the programme arranged for the
evening, the royal guests were to return to the smaller room for
a cup of coffee, and were then to be paraded upstairs before the
multitude who would by that time have arrived, and to remain there
long enough to justify the invited ones in saying that they had spent
the evening with the Emperor and the Princes and the Princesses. The
plan was carried out perfectly. At half-past ten the Emperor was made
to walk upstairs, and for half an hour sat awful and composed in an
arm-chair that had been prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>). How one would wish to see
the inside of the mind of the Emperor as it worked on that occasion!

<p/>Melmotte, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) guests ascended his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) stairs, went back into the
banqueting-room and through to the hall, and wandered about till he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
found Miles Grendall. <div class="bookquote">``Miles,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``tell me what the row is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How row?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>asked Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something wrong, and you know all about it. Why didn't the
people come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>Miles, looking guilty, did not even attempt to deny his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
knowledge. <div class="bookquote">``Come; what is it? We might as well know all about it at
once.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>Miles looked down on the ground, and grunted something. <div class="bookquote">``Is it
about the election?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They got hold of something to-day in the City--about Pickering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They did, did they? And what were they saying about Pickering? Come;
you might as well out with it. You don't suppose that I care what
lies they tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say there's been something--forged. Title-deeds, I think they
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Title-deeds! that I have forged title-deeds. Well; that's beginning
well. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) lordship has stayed away from my house after accepting
my invitation because he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) has heard that story! All right, Miles;
that will do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Great</b></font>)</div>And the Great Financier went upstairs into his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) own
drawing-room.




<p/>CHAPTER LX.

<p/>MISS LONGESTAFFE``S LOVER.


<p/>A few days before that period in our story which we have now reached,
Miss Longestaffe was seated in Lady Monogram's back drawing-room,
discussing the terms on which the two tickets for Madame Melmotte's
grand reception had been transferred to Lady Monogram,--the place on
the cards for the names of the friends whom Madame Melmotte had the
honour of inviting to meet the Emperor and the Princes, having been
left blank; and the terms also on which Miss Longestaffe had been
asked to spend two or three days with her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) dear friend Lady Monogram.
Each lady was disposed to get as much and to give as little as
possible,--in which desire the ladies carried out the ordinary
practice of all parties to a bargain. It had of course been settled
that Lady Monogram was to have the two tickets,--for herself and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) husband,--such tickets at that moment standing very high in the
market. In payment for these valuable considerations, Lady Monogram
was to undertake to chaperon Miss Longestaffe at the entertainment,
to take Miss Longestaffe as a visitor for three days, and to have one
party at her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own house during the time, so that it might be seen that
Miss Longestaffe had other friends in London besides the Melmotte's
on whom to depend for her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) London gaieties. At this moment Miss
Longestaffe felt herself justified in treating the matter as though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) were hardly receiving a fair equivalent. The Melmotte tickets
were certainly ruling very high. They had just culminated. They
fell a little soon afterwards, and at ten P.M. on the night of the
entertainment were hardly worth anything. At the moment which we have
now in hand, there was a rush for them. Lady Monogram had already
secured the tickets. They were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) desk. But, as will sometimes
be the case in a bargain, the seller was complaining that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had
parted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) goods too cheap, some make-weight should be added to
the stipulated price.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for that, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Longestaffe, who, since the rise in
Melmotte stock generally, had endeavoured to resume something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
old manners, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see what you mean at all. You meet Lady Julia
Goldsheiner everywhere, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) father-in-law is Mr. Brehgert's
junior partner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Julia is Lady Julia, my dear, and young Mr. Goldsheiner has,
in some sort of way, got himself in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) hunts, and Damask says
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) is one of the best shots at Hurlingham. I never met old Mr.
Goldsheiner anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I dare say. Mr. Melmotte, of course, entertains all the
City people. I don't think Sir Damask would like me to ask Mr.
Brehgert to dine here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>Lady Monogram managed everything herself with
reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) own parties; invited all her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) own guests, and never
troubled Sir Damask,--who, again, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) side, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) own set of
friends; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) was very clever in the use which she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>)
husband. There were some aspirants who really were taught to think
that Sir Damask was very particular as to the guests whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) welcomed
to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I speak to Sir Damask about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Longestaffe, who was
very urgent on the occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, I really don't think you ought to do that. There are
little things which a man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife must manage together without
interference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody can ever say that I interfered in any family. But really,
Julia, when you tell me that Sir Damask cannot receive Mr. Brehgert,
it does sound odd. As for City people, you know as well as I do, that
that kind of thing is all over now. City people are just as good as
West-end people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great deal better, I dare say. I'm not arguing about that. I don't
make the lines; but there they are; and one gets to know in a sort
of way what they are. I don't pretend to be a bit better than my
neighbours. I like to see people come here whom other people who come
here will like to meet. I'm big enough to hold my own, and so is Sir
Damask. But we ain't big enough to introduce new-comers. I don't
suppose there's anybody in London understands it better than you do,
Georgiana, and therefore it's absurd my pretending to teach you. I
go pretty well everywhere, as you are aware; and I shouldn't know Mr.
Brehgert if I were to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) at the Melmottes', and, in spite of all you said
once, you're glad enough to go there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true, my dear. I don't think that you are just the person to
throw that in my teeth; but never mind that. There's the butcher
round the corner in Bond Street, or the man who comes to do my hair.
I don't at all think of asking them to my house. But if they were
suddenly to turn out wonderful men, and go everywhere, no doubt I
should be glad to have them here. That's the way we live, and you are
as well used to it as I am. Mr. Brehgert at present to me is like the
butcher round the corner.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>Lady Monogram had the tickets safe under
lock and key, or I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) would hardly have said this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) is not a bit like a butcher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Longestaffe, blazing up
in real wrath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did; and it was the unkindest thing you could possibly say.
It was meant to be unkind. It was monstrous. How would you like it if
I said that Sir Damask was like a hair-dresser?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can say so if you please. Sir Damask drives four in hand, rides
as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) meant to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) neck every winter, is one of the best
shots going, and is supposed to understand a yacht as well as any
other gentleman out. And I'm rather afraid that before he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was married
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) used to box with all the prize-fighters, and to be a little too
free behind the scenes. If that makes a man like a hair-dresser,
well, there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How proud you are of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s very good-natured, my dear, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not interfere with
me, I don't interfere with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I hope you'll do as well. I dare say
Mr. Brehgert is good-natured.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)'s an excellent man of business, and is making a very large
fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And has five or six grown-up children, who, no doubt, will be a
comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I don't mind them, why need you? You have none at all, and you
find it lonely enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all lonely. I have everything that I desire. How hard you are
trying to be ill-natured, Georgiana.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was a--butcher?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said nothing of the kind. I didn't even say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was like a
butcher. What I did say was this,--that I don't feel inclined to risk
my own reputation on the appearance of new people at my table. Of
course, I go in for what you call fashion. Some people can dare to
ask anybody they meet in the streets. I can't. I've my own line, and
I mean to follow it. It's hard work, I can tell you; and it would
be harder still if I wasn't particular. If you like Mr. Brehgert to
come here on Tuesday evening, when the rooms will be full, you can
ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>); but as for having him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) to dinner, I--won't--do--it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So the
matter was at last settled. Miss Longestaffe did ask Mr. Brehgert for
the Tuesday evening, and the two ladies were again friends.

<p/>Perhaps Lady Monogram, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) illustrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) position by an
allusion to a butcher and a hair-dresser, had been unaware that Mr.
Brehgert had some resemblance to the form which men in that trade
are supposed to bear. Let us at least hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) was so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was a
fat, greasy man, good-looking in a certain degree, about fifty, with
hair dyed black, and beard and moustache dyed a dark purple colour.
The charm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) face consisted in a pair of very bright black eyes,
which were, however, set too near together in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) face for the
general delight of Christians. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was stout;--fat all over rather
than corpulent,--and had that look of command in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) face which has
become common to master-butchers, probably by long intercourse with
sheep and oxen. But Mr. Brehgert was considered to be a very good man
of business, and was now regarded as being, in a commercial point of
view, the leading member of the great financial firm of which he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was
the second partner. Mr. Todd's day was nearly done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Todd</b></font>) walked about
constantly between Lombard Street, the Exchange, and the Bank,
and talked much to merchants; he (<font color='blue'><b>Todd</b></font>) had an opinion too of his (<font color='blue'><b>Todd</b></font>) own on
particular cases; but the business had almost got beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Todd</b></font>), and Mr.
Brehgert was now supposed to be the moving spirit of the firm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
was a widower, living in a luxurious villa at Fulham with a family,
not indeed grown up, as Lady Monogram had ill-naturedly said, but
which would be grown up before long, varying from an eldest son of
eighteen, who had just been placed at a desk in the office, to the
youngest girl of twelve, who was at school at Brighton. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was a man
who always asked for what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wanted; and having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mind that
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wanted a second wife, had asked Miss Georgiana Longestaffe to fill
that situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) at the Melmottes', had entertained
her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>), with Madame Melmotte and Marie, at Beaudesert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) called
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) villa, had then proposed in the square, and two days after had
received an assenting answer in Bruton Street.

<p/>Poor Miss Longestaffe! Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had acknowledged the fact to Lady
Monogram in her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) desire to pave the way for the reception of herself
into society as a married woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not as yet found courage to
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) family. The man was absolutely a Jew;--not a Jew that had
been, as to whom there might possibly be a doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
father or his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) grandfather had been the last Jew of the family; but
a Jew that was. So was Goldsheiner a Jew, whom Lady Julia Start had
married,--or at any rate had been one a very short time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) ran
away with that lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) counted up ever so many instances on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
fingers of <div class="bookquote">``decent people''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>who had married Jews or Jewesses. Lord
Frederic Framlinghame had married a girl of the Berrenhoffers; and
Mr. Hart had married a Miss Chute. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know much of Miss
Chute, but was certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a Christian. Lord Frederic's wife
and Lady Julia Goldsheiner were seen everywhere. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) hardly
knew how to explain the matter even to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) was sure that
there was at present a general heaving-up of society on this matter,
and a change in progress which would soon make it a matter of
indifference whether anybody was Jew or Christian. For herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>)
regarded the matter not at all, except as far as it might be regarded
by the world in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) wished to live. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) was herself above
all personal prejudices of that kind. Jew, Turk, or infidel was
nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) had seen enough of the world to be aware that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) happiness did not lie in that direction, and could not depend in
the least on the religion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) husband. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) would go to
church herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) always went to church. It was the proper thing to
do. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) husband, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) did not suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) could ever
get him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to church,--nor perhaps would it be desirable,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) thought
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) might induce him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to go nowhere, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) might be able to
pass him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) off as a Christian. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) knew that such was the Christianity
of young Goldsheiner, of which the Starts were now boasting.

<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) been alone in the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) could have
looked forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) destiny with complacency; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) was afraid of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) father and mother. Lady Pomona was distressingly old-fashioned,
and had so often spoken with horror even of the approach of a
Jew,--and had been so loud in denouncing the iniquity of Christians
who allowed such people into their houses! Unfortunately, too,
Georgiana in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) earlier days had re-echoed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother's
sentiments. And then her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father,--if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had ever earned for himself
the right to be called a Conservative politician by holding a real
opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own,--it had been on that matter of admitting the Jews
into parliament. When that had been done he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was certain that the
glory of England was sunk for ever. And since that time, whenever
creditors were more than ordinarily importunate, when Slow and
Bideawhile could do nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) would refer to that fatal
measure as though it was the cause of every embarrassment which had
harassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>). How could she (<font color='blue'><b>creditors</b></font>) tell parents such as these that she (<font color='blue'><b>creditors</b></font>) was
engaged to marry a man who at the present moment went to synagogue on
a Saturday and carried out every other filthy abomination common to
the despised people?

<p/>That Mr. Brehgert was a fat, greasy man of fifty, conspicuous for
hair-dye, was in itself distressing:--but this minor distress
was swallowed up in the greater. Miss Longestaffe was a girl
possessing considerable discrimination, and was able to weigh her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
own possessions in just scales. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had begun life with very high
aspirations, believing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own beauty, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mother's fashion,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father's fortune. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had now been ten years at the work, and
was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had always flown a little too high for her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mark at
the time. At nineteen and twenty and twenty-one she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had thought that
all the world was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>). With her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) commanding figure, regular
long features, and bright complexion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had regarded herself as
one of the beauties of the day, and had considered herself entitled
to demand wealth and a coronet. At twenty-two, twenty-three, and
twenty-four any young peer, or peer's eldest son, with a house in
town and in the country, might have sufficed. Twenty-five and six
had been the years for baronets and squires; and even a leading
fashionable lawyer or two had been marked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) as sufficient
since that time. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was aware that hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had always
fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) price a little too high. On three things she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was still
determined,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would not be poor, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would not be
banished from London, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would not be an old maid. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had often said, <div class="bookquote">``there's one thing certain. I shall never do to
be poor.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Lady Pomona had expressed full concurrence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) child.
<div class="bookquote">``And, mamma, to do as Sophia is doing would kill me. Fancy having to
live at Toodlam all one's life with George Whitstable!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>Lady Pomona
had agreed to this also, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) thought that Toodlam Hall was a
very nice home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) elder daughter. <div class="bookquote">``And, mamma, I should drive
you and papa mad if I were to stay at home always. And what would
become of me when Dolly was master of everything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>Lady Pomona,
looking forward as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was able to the time at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
should herself have departed, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) dower and dower-house would
have reverted to Dolly, acknowledged that Georgiana should provide
herself with a home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) own before that time.

<p/>And how was this to be done? Lovers with all the glories and all
the graces are supposed to be plentiful as blackberries by girls of
nineteen, but have been proved to be rare hothouse fruits by girls
of twenty-nine. Brehgert was rich, would live in London, and would
be a husband. People did such odd things now and <div class="bookquote">``lived them down,''
 (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could see no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) should not do this and live this
down. Courage was the one thing necessary,--that and perseverance.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) must teach herself to talk about Brehgert as Lady Monogram did
of Sir Damask. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had plucked up so much courage as had enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>)
to declare her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) fate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) old friend,--remembering as she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) did so
how in days long past she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) friend Julia Triplex had scattered
their scorn upon some poor girl who had married a man with a Jewish
name,--whose grandfather had possibly been a Jew. <div class="bookquote">``Dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said
Lady Monogram. <div class="bookquote">``Todd, Brehgert, and Goldsheiner! Mr. Todd is--one of
us, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana boldly, <div class="bookquote">``and Mr. Brehgert is a Jew. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) name is
Ezekiel Brehgert, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) is a Jew. You can say what you like about
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say anything about it, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you can think anything you like. Things are changed since you
and I were younger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much changed, it appears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monogram. Sir Damask's
religion had never been doubted, though except on the occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
marriage no acquaintance of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had probably ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) in church.

<p/>But to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) father and mother required a higher spirit than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had shown even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) communication to Lady Monogram, and that
spirit had not as yet come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>). On the morning before she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) left
the Melmottes in Bruton Street, her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) lover had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>). The
Melmottes of course knew of the engagement and quite approved of it.
Madame Melmotte rather aspired to credit for having had so happy
an affair arranged under her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) auspices. It was some set-off against
Marie's unfortunate escapade. Mr. Brehgert, therefore, had been
allowed to come and go as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) pleased, and on that morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had
pleased to come. They were sitting alone in some back room, and
Brehgert was pressing for an early day. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think we need talk
of that yet, Mr. Brehgert,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might as well get over the difficulty and call me Ezekiel at
once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) remarked. Georgiana frowned, and made no soft little
attempt at the name as ladies in such circumstances are wont to
do. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Brehgert'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) alluded of course to the mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
children--<div class="bookquote">``used to call me Ezzy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I shall do so some day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Miss Longestaffe, looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) lover, and asking herself why she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) should not have been able to
have the house and the money and the name of the wife without the
troubles appertaining. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not think it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should
ever call him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) Ezzy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And ven shall it be? I should say as early in August as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In August!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) almost screamed. It was already July.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vy not, my dear? Ve would have our little holiday in Germany,--at
Vienna. I have business there, and know many friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hard to fix some day in the next month. It would be
expedient that they should be married from the Melmottes' house, and
the Melmottes would leave town some time in August. There was truth
in this. Unless married from the Melmottes' house, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must go down
to Caversham for the occasion,--which would be intolerable. No;--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
must separate herself altogether from father and mother, and become
one with the Melmottes and the Brehgerts,--till she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could live it
down and make a position for herself. If the spending of money could
do it, it should be done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must at any rate ask mamma about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana. Mr.
Brehgert, with the customary good-humour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) people, was satisfied
with the answer, and went away promising that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) love
at the great Melmotte reception. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sat silent, thinking how
she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) should declare the matter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) family. Would it not be better
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) to say to them at once that there must be a division among
them,--an absolute breaking off of all old ties, so that it should be
tacitly acknowledged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), Georgiana, had gone out from among
the Longestaffes altogether, and had become one with the Melmottes,
Brehgerts, and Goldsheiners?




<p/>CHAPTER LXI.

<p/>LADY MONOGRAM PREPARES FOR THE PARTY.


<p/>When the little conversation took place between Lady Monogram and
Miss Longestaffe, as recorded in the last chapter, Mr. Melmotte
was in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) glory, and tickets for the entertainment were very
precious. Gradually their value subsided. Lady Monogram had paid very
dear for hers,--especially as the reception of Mr. Brehgert must be
considered. But high prices were then being paid. A lady offered to
take Marie Melmotte into the country with her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) for a week; but this
was before the elopement. Mr. Cohenlupe was asked out to dinner to
meet two peers and a countess. Lord Alfred received various presents.
A young lady gave a lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair to Lord Nidderdale, although it
was known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was to marry Marie Melmotte. And Miles Grendall got
back an I. O. U. of considerable nominal value from Lord Grasslough,
who was anxious to accommodate two country cousins who were in
London. Gradually the prices fell;--not at first from any doubt in
Melmotte, but through that customary reaction which may be expected
on such occasions. But at eight or nine o'clock on the evening of
the party the tickets were worth nothing. The rumour had then spread
itself through the whole town from Pimlico to Marylebone. Men coming
home from clubs had told their wives. Ladies who had been in the park
had heard it. Even the hairdressers had it, and ladies' maids had
been instructed by the footmen and grooms who had been holding horses
and seated on the coach-boxes. It had got into the air, and had
floated round dining-rooms and over toilet-tables.

<p/>I doubt whether Sir Damask would have said a word about it to his (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>)
wife as he (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) was dressing for dinner, had he (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) calculated what might
be the result to himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) came home open-mouthed, and made
no calculation. <div class="bookquote">``Have you heard what's up, Ju?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) said, rushing
half-dressed into his (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) wife's room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you been out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was shopping, and that kind of thing. I don't want to take that
girl into the Park. I've made a mistake in having her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here, but I
mean to be seen with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as little as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be good-natured, Ju, whatever you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother! I know what I'm about. What is it you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say Melmotte's been found out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Found out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Monogram, stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) maid in some
arrangement which would not need to be continued in the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>)
not going to the reception. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by found out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know exactly. There are a dozen stories told. It's something
about that place he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bought of old Longestaffe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are the Longestaffes mixed up in it? I won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) here a day
longer if there is anything against them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be an ass, Ju. There's nothing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) except that the
poor old fellow hasn't got a shilling of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s ruined,--and there's an end of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will get it now. Some say that Melmotte has forged a
receipt, others a letter. Some declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has manufactured a
whole set of title-deeds. You remember Dolly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know Dolly Longestaffe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monogram, who had
thought at one time that an alliance with Dolly might be convenient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has found it all out. There was always something about
Dolly more than fellows gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) credit for. At any rate, everybody
says that Melmotte will be in quod before long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to-night, Damask!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody seems to know. Lupton was saying that the policemen would
wait about in the room like servants till the Emperor and the Princes
had gone away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Lupton going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lupton</b></font>) was to have been at the dinner, but hadn't made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupton</b></font>) mind
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupton</b></font>)'d go or not when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lupton</b></font>). Nobody seems to be quite
certain whether the Emperor will go. Somebody said that a Cabinet
Council was to be called to know what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Cabinet Council!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see it's rather an awkward thing, letting the Prince go to
dine with a man who perhaps may have been arrested and taken to gaol
before dinner-time. That's the worst part of it. Nobody knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Monogram waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) attendant away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) piqued herself upon
having a French maid who could not speak a word of English, and was
therefore quite careless what she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) said in the woman's presence. But,
of course, everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) did say was repeated down-stairs in some
language that had become intelligible to the servants generally. Lady
Monogram sat motionless for some time, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) husband, retreating
to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own domain, finished his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) operations. <div class="bookquote">``Damask,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) said, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reappeared, <div class="bookquote">``one thing is certain;--we can't go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After you've made such a fuss about it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity,--having that girl here in the house. You know, don't
you, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s going to marry one of these people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marriage yesterday. But Brehgert isn't one of
Melmotte's set. They tell me that Brehgert isn't a bad fellow. A
vulgar cad, and all that, but nothing wrong about him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)'s a Jew,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)'s seventy years old, and makes up horribly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter to you if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)'s eighty? You are determined, then,
you won't go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div><p/>But Lady Monogram had by no means determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) wouldn't go.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) price, and with that economy which sticks to a woman
always in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) extravagances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) could not bear to lose
the thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had bought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) cared nothing for Melmotte's
villainy, as regarded herself. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was enriching himself by the
daily plunder of the innocent she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had taken for granted since she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had
first heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had but a confused idea of any difference
between commerce and fraud. But it would grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) greatly to
become known as one of an awkward squad of people who had driven to
the door, and perhaps been admitted to some wretched gathering of
wretched people,--and not, after all, to have met the Emperor and
the Prince. But then, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) hear on the next morning that the
Emperor and the Princes, that the Princesses, and the Duchesses,
with the Ambassadors, Cabinet Ministers, and proper sort of world
generally, had all been there,--that the world, in short, had ignored
Melmotte's villainy,--then would her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) grief be still greater. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) sat
down to dinner with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) husband and Miss Longestaffe, and could not
talk freely on the matter. Miss Longestaffe was still a guest of the
Melmottes, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had transferred herself to the Monograms
for a day or two. And a horrible idea crossed Lady Monogram's mind.
What should she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) friend Georgiana if the whole Melmotte
establishment were suddenly broken up? Of course, Madame Melmotte
would refuse to take the girl back if her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband were sent to gaol.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose you'll go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Damask</b></font>)</div>said Sir Damask as the ladies left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we shall,--in about an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monogram as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) left the room, looking round at him (<font color='blue'><b>Damask</b></font>) and rebuking him (<font color='blue'><b>Damask</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Damask</b></font>)
imprudence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, you know--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Damask</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``If you want me
I'll stay, of course; but if you don't, I'll go down to the club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I say, yet? You needn't mind the club to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right;--only it's a bore being here alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Miss Longestaffe asked what <div class="bookquote">``was up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is there any doubt about
our going to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say. I'm so harassed that I don't know what I'm about. There
seems to be a report that the Emperor won't be there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well to say impossible, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monogram;
<div class="bookquote">``but still that's what people are saying. You see Mr. Melmotte is a
very great man, but perhaps--something else has turned up, so that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) may be thrown over. Things of that kind do happen. You had better
finish dressing. I shall. But I shan't make sure of going till I hear
that the Emperor is there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) descended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) husband, whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) found forlornly consoling himself with a cigar. <div class="bookquote">``Damask,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``you must find out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Find out what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether the Prince and the Emperor are there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Send John to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>suggested the husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) would be sure to make a blunder about it. If you'd go yourself
you'd learn the truth in a minute. Have a cab,--just go into the hall
and you'll soon know how it all is;--I'd do it in a minute if I were
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Damask the man</b></font>)</div>Sir Damask was the most good-natured man in the world, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
did not like the job. <div class="bookquote">``What can be the objection?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to a man's house and find out whether a man's guests are come
before you go yourself! I don't just see it, Ju.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guests! What nonsense! The Emperor and all the Royal Family! As if
it were like any other party. Such a thing, probably, never happened
before, and never will happen again. If you don't go, Damask, I

a minute, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made many remonstrances. It was
a confounded bore. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated emperors and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated princes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated
the whole box and dice of that sort of thing! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``wished to goodness''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had dined at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) club and sent word up home that the affair
was to be off. But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) submitted, and allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife to
leave the room with the intention of sending for a cab. The cab was
sent for and announced, but Sir Damask would not stir till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
finished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) big cigar.

<p/>It was past ten when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own house. On arriving in Grosvenor
Square he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could at once see that the party was going on. The house
was illuminated. There was a concourse of servants round the door,
and half the square was already blocked up with carriages. It was
not without delay that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got to the door, and when there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the
royal liveries. There was no doubt about the party. The Emperor and
the Princes and the Princesses were all there. As far as Sir Damask
could then perceive, the dinner had been quite a success. But again
there was a delay in getting away, and it was nearly eleven before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) could reach home. <div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``They're
there, safe enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure that the Emperor is there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As sure as a man can be without having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Longestaffe was present at this moment, and could not but resent
what appeared to be a most unseemly slur cast upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) friends. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't understand it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Of course the Emperor is
there. Everybody has known for the last month that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) was coming.
What is the meaning of it, Julia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, you must allow me to manage my own little affairs my own
way. I dare say I am absurd. But I have my reason. Now, Damask, if
the carriage is there we had better start.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>The carriage was there,
and they did start, and with a delay which seemed unprecedented, even
to Lady Monogram, who was accustomed to these things, they reached
the door. There was a great crush in the hall, and people were coming
down-stairs. But at last they made their way into the room above,
and found that the Emperor of China and all the Royalties had been
there,--but had taken their departure.

<p/>Sir Damask put the ladies into the carriage and went at once to his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)
club.




<p/>CHAPTER LXII.

<p/>THE PARTY.


<p/>Lady Monogram retired from Mr. Melmotte's house in disgust as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) was able to escape; but we must return to it for a short time.
When the guests were once in the drawing-room the immediate sense
of failure passed away. The crowd never became so thick as had been
anticipated. They who were knowing in such matters had declared that
the people would not be able to get themselves out of the room till
three or four o'clock in the morning, and that the carriages would
not get themselves out of the Square till breakfast time. With a view
to this kind of thing Mr. Melmotte had been told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must provide
a private means of escape for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) illustrious guests, and with a
considerable sacrifice of walls and general house arrangements this
had been done. No such gathering as was expected took place; but
still the rooms became fairly full, and Mr. Melmotte was able to
console himself with the feeling that nothing certainly fatal had as
yet occurred.

<p/>There can be no doubt that the greater part of the people assembled
did believe that their host had committed some great fraud which
might probably bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) under the arm of the law. When such rumours
are spread abroad, they are always believed. There is an excitement
and a pleasure in believing them. Reasonable hesitation at such a
moment is dull and phlegmatic. If the accused one be near enough to
ourselves to make the accusation a matter of personal pain, of course
we disbelieve. But, if the distance be beyond this, we are almost
ready to think that anything may be true of anybody. In this case
nobody really loved Melmotte and everybody did believe. It was so
probable that such a man should have done something horrible! It was
only hoped that the fraud might be great and horrible enough.

<p/>Melmotte himself during that part of the evening which was passed
up-stairs kept himself in the close vicinity of royalty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) behaved
certainly very much better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have done had he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
no weight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) made few attempts at beginning any
conversation, and answered, at any rate with brevity, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
addressed. With scrupulous care he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ticked off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) memory the names
of those who had come and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew, thinking that their presence
indicated a verdict of acquittal from them on the evidence already
before them. Seeing the members of the Government all there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had come forward in Westminster as a Liberal. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>)
freely forgave those omissions of Royalty as to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) had been so
angry at the India Office, seeing that not a Prince or Princess was
lacking of those who were expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) mind to all
this, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) knew how great was his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) danger. Many things occurred
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stood, striving to smile as a host should smile. It
might be the case that half-a-dozen detectives were already stationed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) own hall,--perhaps one or two, well dressed, in the very
presence of royalty,--ready to arrest him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) as soon as the guests
were gone, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) now lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should escape. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) bore the
burden,--and smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had always lived with the consciousness that
such a burden was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and might crush him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) at any time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had to run these risks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had told himself a thousand
times that when the dangers came, dangers alone should never cow
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had always endeavoured to go as near the wind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could,
to avoid the heavy hand of the criminal law of whatever country he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
inhabited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had studied the criminal laws, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might be sure
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) reckonings; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had always felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might be carried by
circumstances into deeper waters than he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) intended to enter. As the
soldier who leads a forlorn hope, or as the diver who goes down for
pearls, or as the searcher for wealth on fever-breeding coasts, knows
that as his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) gains may be great, so are his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) perils, Melmotte had been
aware that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) life, as it opened itself out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might come
to terrible destruction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not always thought, or even hoped,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was now, so exalted as to be allowed to
entertain the very biggest ones of the earth; but the greatness had
grown upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--and so had the danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could not now be as exact
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was prepared himself to bear all mere ignominy
with a tranquil mind,--to disregard any shouts of reprobation which
might be uttered, and to console himself when the bad quarter of an
hour should come with the remembrance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had garnered up a store
sufficient for future wants and placed it beyond the reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
enemies. But as his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) intellect opened up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) new schemes, and as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ambition got the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) prudence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) gradually fell from
the security which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had preconceived, and became aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
might have to bear worse than ignominy.

<p/>Perhaps never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) life had he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) studied his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own character and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
own conduct more accurately, or made sterner resolves, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) stood there smiling, bowing, and acting without impropriety
the part of host to an Emperor. No;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) could not run away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) soon
made himself sure of that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had risen too high to be a successful
fugitive, even should he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) succeed in getting off before hands were
laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) must bide his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) ground, if only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) might not
at once confess his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) own guilt by flight; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) would do so with
courage. Looking back at the hour or two that had just passed he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) was
aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had allowed himself not only to be frightened in the
dinner-room,--but also to seem to be frightened. The thing had come
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) unawares and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had been untrue to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) acknowledged
that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) should not have asked those questions of Mr. Todd and Mr.
Beauclerk, and should have been more good-humoured than usual with
Lord Alfred in discussing those empty seats. But for spilt milk there
is no remedy. The blow had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) too suddenly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) had
faltered. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) would not falter again. Nothing should cow him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>),--no
touch from a policeman, no warrant from a magistrate, no defalcation
of friends, no scorn in the City, no solitude in the West End. He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>)
would go down among the electors to-morrow and would stand his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>)
ground, as though all with him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) were right. Men should know at any
rate that he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had a heart within his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) bosom. And he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) confessed also to
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had sinned in that matter of arrogance. He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) could see
it now,--as so many of us do see the faults which we have committed,
which we strive, but in vain, to discontinue, and which we never
confess except to our own bosoms. The task which he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had imposed on
himself, and to which circumstances had added weight, had been very
hard to bear. He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) should have been good-humoured to these great ones
whose society he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had gained. He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) should have bound these people to him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>)
by a feeling of kindness as well as by his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) money. He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) could see it all
now. And he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) could see too that there was no help for spilt milk. I
think he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) took some pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) own confidence as to his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) own courage,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) stood there turning it all over in his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) mind. Very much might be
suspected. Something might be found out. But the task of unravelling
it all would not be easy. It is the small vermin and the little birds
that are trapped at once. But wolves and vultures can fight hard
before they are caught. With the means which would still be at his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>)
command, let the worst come to the worst, he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) could make a strong
fight. When a man's frauds have been enormous there is a certain
safety in their very diversity and proportions. Might it not be that
the fact that these great ones of the earth had been his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) guests
should speak in his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) favour? A man who had in very truth had the real
brother of the Sun dining at his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) table could hardly be sent into the
dock and then sent out of it like a common felon.

<p/>Madame Melmotte during the evening stood at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own stairs
with a chair behind her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) on which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could rest herself for a moment
when any pause took place in the arrivals. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had of course dined
at the table,--or rather sat there;--but had been so placed that no
duty had devolved upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had heard no word of the rumours,
and would probably be the last person in that house to hear them. It
never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to see whether the places down the table were
full or empty. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) large eyes fixed on the Majesty of
China and must have wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own destiny at finding herself
with an Emperor and Princes to look at. From the dining-room she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
gone when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was told to go, up to the drawing-room, and had there
performed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) task, longing only for the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bedroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),
I think, had but small sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) husband in all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) work,
and but little understanding of the position in which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been
placed. Money she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) liked, and comfort, and perhaps diamonds and fine
dresses, but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) can hardly have taken pleasure in duchesses or
have enjoyed the company of the Emperor. From the beginning of the
Melmotte era it had been an understood thing that no one spoke to
Madame Melmotte.

<p/>Marie Melmotte had declined a seat at the dinner-table. This at first
had been cause of quarrel between her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) desired
to have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) next to young Lord Nidderdale as being acknowledged
to be betrothed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). But since the journey to Liverpool he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had
said nothing on the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) still pressed the engagement, but
thought now that less publicity might be expedient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was, however,
in the drawing-room standing at first by Madame Melmotte, and
afterwards retreating among the crowd. To some ladies she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a
person of interest as the young woman who had lately run away under
such strange circumstances; but no one spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw a
girl whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself knew, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) addressed, plucking up all
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) courage for the occasion. This was Hetta Carbury who had been
brought hither by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother.

<p/>The tickets for Lady Carbury and Hetta had of course been sent before
the elopement;--and also, as a matter of course, no reference had
been made to them by the Melmotte family after the elopement. Lady
Carbury herself was anxious that that affair should not be considered
as having given cause for any personal quarrel between herself
and Mr. Melmotte, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) difficulty had consulted Mr. Broune.
Mr. Broune was the staff on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) leant at present in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
difficulties. Mr. Broune was going to the dinner. All this of course
took place while Melmotte's name was as yet unsullied as snow. Mr.
Broune saw no reason why Lady Carbury should not take advantage of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) tickets. These invitations were simply tickets to see the Emperor
surrounded by the Princes. The young lady's elopement is <div class="bookquote">``no affair
of yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>Mr. Broune had said. <div class="bookquote">``I should go, if it were only for the
sake of showing that you did not consider yourself to be implicated
in the matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was advised, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
daughter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, when Hetta objected;
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Broune sees it quite in the right light. This is a grand
demonstration in honour of the Emperor, rather than a private
party;--and we have done nothing to offend the Melmottes. You know
you wish to see the Emperor.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>A few minutes before they started
from Welbeck Street a note came from Mr. Broune, written in pencil
and sent from Melmotte's house by a Commissioner. ``Don't mind what
you hear; but come. I am here and as far as I can see it is all
right. The E. is beautiful, and P.<div class="bookquote">``s are as thick as blackberries.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury, who had not been in the way of hearing the reports,
understood nothing of this; but of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) went. And Hetta went
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).

<p/>Hetta was standing alone in a corner, near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother, who was
talking to Mr. Booker, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes fixed on the awful tranquillity
of the Emperor's countenance, when Marie Melmotte timidly crept up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was. Hetta, probably, was not very cordial
to the poor girl, being afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), partly as the daughter of
the great Melmotte and partly as the girl with whom her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brother
had failed to run away; but Marie was not rebuked by this. <div class="bookquote">``I hope
you won't be angry with me for speaking to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta smiled more
graciously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could not be angry with the girl for speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>),
feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was there as the guest of the girl's mother. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose you know about your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, whispering with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
eyes turned to the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never told me himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do so wish that I knew the truth. I know nothing. Of course,
Miss Carbury, I love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). I do love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) so dearly! I hope you don't
think I would have done it if I hadn't loved him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) better than anybody
in the world. Don't you think that if a girl loves a man,--really
loves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--that ought to go before everything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a question that Hetta was hardly prepared to answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
felt quite certain that under no circumstances would she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) run away
with a man. <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite know. It is so hard to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. What's the good of anything if you're to be broken-hearted?
I don't care what they say of me, or what they do to me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
only be true to me. Why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--let me know--something about it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This also was a question difficult to be answered. Since that horrid
morning on which Sir Felix had stumbled home drunk,--which was now
four days since,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not left the house in Welbeck Street till
this evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone out a few minutes before Lady Carbury had
started, but up to that time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had almost kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
not get up till dinner-time, would come down after some half-dressed
fashion, and then get back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bedroom, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would smoke and
drink brandy-and-water and complain of headache. The theory was that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ill;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in fact utterly cowed and did not dare to
show himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual haunts. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had quarrelled
at the club, aware that all the world knew of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended journey to
Liverpool, aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tumbled about the streets intoxicated.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not dared to show himself, and the feeling had grown upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from day to day. Now, fairly worn out by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confinement, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had crept out intending, if possible, to find consolation with Ruby
Ruggles. <div class="bookquote">``Do tell me. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>pleaded Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not been very well lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ill? Oh, Miss Carbury, do tell me. You can understand what it
is to love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as I do;--can't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been ill. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is better now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not come to me, or send to me; or let me know something?
It is cruel, is it not? Tell me,--you must know,--does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really care
for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta was exceedingly perplexed. The real feeling betrayed by the
girl recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Hetta could not but sympathize with the
affection manifested for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own brother, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could hardly
understand the want of reticence displayed by Marie in thus speaking
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) love to one who was almost a stranger. <div class="bookquote">``Felix hardly ever
talks about himself to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't care for me, there shall be an end of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie said
very gravely. <div class="bookquote">``If I only knew! If I thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved me, I'd go
through,--oh,--all the world for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Nothing that papa could say
should stop me. That's my feeling about it. I have never talked to
any one but you about it. Isn't that strange? I haven't a person to
talk to. That's my feeling, and I'm not a bit ashamed of it. There's
no disgrace in being in love. But it's very bad to get married
without being in love. That's what I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, thinking of Roger Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if Felix doesn't care for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>continued Marie, sinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
voice to a low whisper, but still making her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) words quite audible to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) companion. Now Hetta was strongly of opinion that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) brother
did not in the least <div class="bookquote">``care for''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>Marie Melmotte, and that it would be
very much for the best that Marie Melmotte should know the truth. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not that sort of strength which would have enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to
tell it. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me just what you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. Hetta was still
silent. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,--I see. Then I must give him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) up? Eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I say, Miss Melmotte? Felix never tells me. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is my
brother,--and of course I love you for loving him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>This was almost
more than Hetta meant; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) felt herself constrained to say some
gracious word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you? Oh! I wish you did. I should so like to be loved by you.
Nobody loves me, I think. That man there wants to marry me. Do you
know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is Lord Nidderdale. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very nice; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not
love me any more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves you. That's the way with men. It isn't
the way with me. I would go with Felix and slave for him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) were
poor. Is it all to be over then? You will give him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) a message from
me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta, doubting as to the propriety of the promise, promised
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would. <div class="bookquote">``Just tell him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) I want to know; that's all. I want to
know. You'll understand. I want to know the real truth. I suppose I
do know it now. Then I shall not care what happens to me. It will be
all the same. I suppose I shall marry that young man, though it will
be very bad. I shall just be as if I hadn't any self of my own at
all. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to send me word after all that has passed. Do not
you think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to send me word?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) crept away.

<p/>Nidderdale had been observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been talking to Miss
Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had heard the rumour, and of course felt that it behoved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) to be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) guard more specially than any one else. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
had not believed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had heard. That men should be thoroughly
immoral, that they should gamble, get drunk, run into debt, and make
love to other men's wives, was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) a matter of every-day life.
Nothing of that kind shocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) at all. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was not as yet
quite old enough to believe in swindling. It had been impossible to
convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) that Miles Grendall had cheated at cards, and the idea
that Mr. Melmotte had forged was as improbable and shocking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
as that an officer should run away in battle. Common soldiers, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
thought, might do that sort of thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had almost fallen in love
with Marie when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) last, and was inclined to feel the more
kindly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) now because of the hard things that were being said
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must be careful. If <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
came a cropper''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in this matter, it would be such an awful cropper!
<div class="bookquote">``How do you like the party?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said to Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like it at all, my lord. How do you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much, indeed. I think the Emperor is the greatest fun I ever
saw. Prince Frederic,'' (<font color='red'><b>the princes</b></font>)</div>--one of the German princes who was staying at
the time among his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) English cousins,--<div class="bookquote">``Prince Frederic says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>)'s
stuffed with hay, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>)'s made up fresh every morning at a shop
in the Haymarket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) opens his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) mouth, of course. There is machinery as well as hay.
I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>)'s the grandest old buffer out, and I'm awfully glad that
I've dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>). I couldn't make out whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) really put
anything to eat into his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) jolly old mouth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been thinking about what we were talking about the other
day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my lord,--I haven't thought about it since. Why should I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--it's a sort of thing that people do think about, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't think about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I? I've been thinking about nothing else the last three
months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been thinking whether you'd get married or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't what I mean, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be shot if I can understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. And you never will understand me. Oh,
goodness;--they're all going, and we must get out of the way. Is that
Prince Frederic, who told you about the hay? He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) is handsome; isn't
he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>)? And who is that in the violet dress;--with all the pearls?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the Princess Dwarza.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me;--isn't it odd, having a lot of people in one's own house,
and not being able to speak a word to them? I don't think it's at all
nice. Good night, my lord. I'm glad you like the Emperor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>And then the people went, and when they had all gone Melmotte put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife and daughter into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own carriage, telling them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would follow them on foot to Bruton Street when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had given some
last directions to the people who were putting out the lights, and
extinguishing generally the embers of the entertainment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
looked round for Lord Alfred, taking care to avoid the appearance of
searching; but Lord Alfred had gone. Lord Alfred was one of those who
knew when to leave a falling house. Melmotte at the moment thought
of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had done for Lord Alfred, and it was something of the
real venom of ingratitude that stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) at the moment rather than
this additional sign of coming evil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was more than ordinarily
gracious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) wife into the carriage, and remarked that,
considering all things, the party had gone off very well. <div class="bookquote">``I only
wish it could have been done a little cheaper,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) said laughing.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) went back into the house, and up into the drawing-rooms which
were now utterly deserted. Some of the lights had been put out, but
the men were busy in the rooms below, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) threw himself into the
chair in which the Emperor had sat. It was wonderful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) should
come to such a fate as this;--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>), the boy out of the gutter,
should entertain at his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) own house, in London, a Chinese Emperor and
English and German Royalty,--and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) should do so almost with a
rope round his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) neck. Even if this were to be the end of it all, men
would at any rate remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>). The grand dinner which he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had given
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) was put into prison would live in history. And it would be
remembered, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had been the Conservative candidate for the
great borough of Westminster,--perhaps, even, the elected member. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>),
too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) manner, assured himself that a great part of him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) would
escape Oblivion. <div class="bookquote">``Non omnis moriar,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in some language of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own, was
chanted by him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) within his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own breast, as he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) sat there looking out on
his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own magnificent suite of rooms from the arm-chair which had been
consecrated by the use of an Emperor.

<p/>No policemen had come to trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) yet. No hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) would
be <div class="bookquote">``wanted''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had been made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>). There was no tangible sign that
things were not to go on as they went before. Things would be exactly
as they were before, but for the absence of those guests from the
dinner-table, and for the words which Miles Grendall had spoken. Had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) not allowed himself to be terrified by shadows? Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had
known that there must be such shadows. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) life had been made dark by
similar clouds before now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had lived through the storms which
had followed them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was thoroughly ashamed of the weakness which
had overcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) at the dinner-table, and of that palsy of fear which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) had allowed himself to exhibit. There should be no more shrinking
such as that. When people talked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) they should say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) was
at least a man.

<p/>As this was passing through his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) mind a head was pushed in through one
of the doors, and immediately withdrawn. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) Secretary. <div class="bookquote">``Is
that you, Miles?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Come in. I'm just going home, and came up
here to see how the empty rooms would look after they were all gone.
What became of your father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, unable to hinder himself from
throwing a certain tone of scorn into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) voice,--as though
proclaiming the fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own house and the consequent running away
of the rat. <div class="bookquote">``It went off very well, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles, still standing at the door. There had been
a few words of consultation between him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) father,--only a
very few words. <div class="bookquote">``You'd better see it out to-night, as you've had a
regular salary, and all that. I shall hook it. I sha'n't go near him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
to-morrow till I find out how things are going. By G--, I've had
about enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>But hardly enough of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) money,--or it may be
presumed that Lord Alfred would have <div class="bookquote">``hooked it''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Alfred/Grendall/Alfred</b></font>)</div>sooner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you come in, and not stand there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``There's
no Emperor here now for you to be afraid of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid of nobody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles, walking into the middle of the
room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor am I. What's one man that another man should be afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
We've got to die, and there'll be an end of it, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles, hardly following the working of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
master's mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't care how soon. When a man has worked as I have done,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets about tired at my age. I suppose I'd better be down at the
committee-room about ten to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the best, I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be there by that time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>Miles Grendall assented slowly, and
with imperfect assent. <div class="bookquote">``And tell your father he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might as well be
there as early as convenient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>said Miles as he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Curs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte almost aloud. <div class="bookquote">``They neither of them will be
there. If any evil can be done to me by treachery and desertion, they
will do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) to think whether the Grendall
article had been worth all the money that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) had paid for it.
<div class="bookquote">``Curs!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) said again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) walked down into the hall, and through the
banqueting-room, and stood at the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) himself had sat.
What a scene it had been, and how frightfully low his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) heart had sunk
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)! It had been the defection of the Lord Mayor that had hit
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) hardest. <div class="bookquote">``What cowards they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>The men went on with their
work, not noticing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>), and probably not knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>). The dinner had
been done by contract, and the contractor's foreman was there. The
care of the house and the alterations had been confided to another
contractor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) foreman was waiting to see the place locked up.
A confidential clerk, who had been with Melmotte for years, and who
knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ways, was there also to guard the property. <div class="bookquote">``Good night,
Croll,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said to the man in German. Croll touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) hat and bade
him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) good night. Melmotte listened anxiously to the tone of the man's
voice, trying to catch from it some indication of the mind within.
Did Croll know of these rumours, and if so, what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) think of
them? Croll had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) in some perilous circumstances before, and
had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) through them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) paused a moment as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) would
ask a question, but resolved at last that silence would be safest.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll see everything safe, eh, Croll?''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>Croll said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) would see
everything safe, and Melmotte passed out into the Square.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not far to go, round through Berkeley Square into Bruton
Street, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) stood for a few moments looking up at the bright
stars. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) could be there, in one of those unknown distant worlds,
with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) present intellect and none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) present burdens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>)
would, he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) thought, do better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) had done here on earth. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>)
could even now put himself down nameless, fameless, and without
possessions in some distant corner of the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>)
thought, do better. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) was Augustus Melmotte, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must bear
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) burdens, whatever they were, to the end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could reach no place
so distant but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be known and traced.

<p/>CHAPTER LXIII.

<p/>MR. MELMOTTE ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTION.


<p/>No election of a Member of Parliament by ballot in a borough so large
as that of Westminster had as yet been achieved in England since the
ballot had been established by law. Men who heretofore had known,
or thought that they knew, how elections would go, who counted up
promises, told off professed enemies, and weighed the doubtful ones,
now confessed themselves to be in the dark. Three days since the odds
had been considerably in Melmotte's favour; but this had come from
the reputation attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) name, rather than from any calculation
as to the politics of the voters. Then Sunday had intervened. On
the Monday Melmotte's name had continued to go down in the betting
from morning to evening. Early in the day his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) supporters had thought
little of this, attributing the fall to that vacillation which
is customary in such matters; but towards the latter part of the
afternoon the tidings from the City had been in everybody's mouth,
and Melmotte's committee-room had been almost deserted. At six
o'clock there were some who suggested that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) name should be
withdrawn. No such suggestion, however, was made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--perhaps
because no one dared to make it. On the Monday evening all work and
strategy for the election, as regarded Melmotte and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) party, died
away; and the interest of the hour was turned to the dinner.

<p/>But Mr. Alf's supporters were very busy. There had been a close
consultation among a few of them as to what should be done by their
Committee as to these charges against the opposite candidate. In the
<div class="bookquote">``Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>of that evening an allusion had been made to the affair,
which was of course sufficiently intelligible to those who were
immediately concerned in the matter, but which had given no name and
mentioned no details. Mr. Alf explained that this had been put in by
the sub-editor, and that it only afforded such news as the paper was
bound to give to the public. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) himself pointed out the fact that no
note of triumph had been sounded, and that the rumour had not been
connected with the election.

<p/>One old gentleman was of opinion that they were bound to make the
most of it. <div class="bookquote">``It's no more than we've all believed all along,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said
the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``and why are we to let a fellow like that get
the seat if we can keep him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was of opinion that everything
should be done to make the rumour with all its exaggerations as
public as possible,--so that there should be no opening for an
indictment for libel; and the clever old gentleman was full of
devices by which this might be effected. But the Committee generally
was averse to fight in this manner. Public opinion has its Bar as
well as the Law Courts. If, after all, Melmotte had committed no
fraud,--or, as was much more probable, should not be convicted of
fraud,--then it would be said that the accusation had been forged for
purely electioneering purposes, and there might be a rebound which
would pretty well crush all those who had been concerned. Individual
gentlemen could, of course, say what they pleased to individual
voters; but it was agreed at last that no overt use should be made of
the rumours by Mr. Alf's Committee. In regard to other matters, they
who worked under the Committee were busy enough. The dinner to the
Emperor was turned into ridicule, and the electors were asked whether
they felt themselves bound to return a gentleman out of the City to
Parliament because he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had offered to spend a fortune on entertaining
all the royalties then assembled in London. There was very much said
on placards and published in newspapers to the discredit of Melmotte,
but nothing was so printed which would not have appeared with equal
venom had the recent rumours never been sent out from the City. At
twelve o'clock at night, when Mr. Alf's committee-room was being
closed, and when Melmotte was walking home to bed, the general
opinion at the clubs was very much in favour of Mr. Alf.

<p/>On the next morning Melmotte was up before eight. As yet no policeman
had called for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), nor had any official intimation reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that
an accusation was to be brought against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). On coming down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
bedroom he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at once went into the back-parlour on the ground floor,
which Mr. Longestaffe called his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) study, and which Mr. Melmotte had
used since he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been in Mr. Longestaffe's house for the work which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be there often early in the morning, and
often late at night after Lord Alfred had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>). There were two
heavy desk-tables in the room, furnished with drawers down to the
ground. One of these the owner of the house had kept locked for his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
own purposes. When the bargain for the temporary letting of the house
had been made, Mr. Melmotte and Mr. Longestaffe were close friends.
Terms for the purchase of Pickering had just been made, and no
cause for suspicion had as yet arisen. Everything between the two
gentlemen had been managed with the greatest ease. Oh dear, yes! Mr.
Longestaffe could come whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) pleased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>), Melmotte, always left
the house at ten and never returned till six. The ladies would never
enter that room. The servants were to regard Mr. Longestaffe quite
as master of the house as far as that room was concerned. If Mr.
Longestaffe could spare it, Mr. Melmotte would take the key of one of
the tables. The matter was arranged very pleasantly.

<p/>Mr. Melmotte, on entering the room bolted the door, and then, sitting
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own table, took certain papers out of the drawers,--a bundle
of letters and another of small documents. From these, with very
little examination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took three or four,--two or three perhaps
from each. These he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) tore into very small fragments and burned the
bits,--holding them over a gas-burner and letting the ashes fall into
a large china plate. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) blew the ashes into the yard through the
open window. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did to all these documents but one. This one he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
put bit by bit into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mouth, chewing the paper into a pulp till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) swallowed it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had done this, and had re-locked his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
drawers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) walked across to the other table, Mr. Longestaffe's
table, and pulled the handle of one of the drawers. It opened;--and
then, without touching the contents, he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) again closed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) then
knelt down and examined the lock, and the hole above into which the
bolt of the lock ran. Having done this he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) again closed the drawer,
drew back the bolt of the door, and, seating himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own desk,
rang the bell which was close to hand. The servant found him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) writing
letters after his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) usual hurried fashion, and was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was
ready for breakfast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) always breakfasted alone with a heap of
newspapers around him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) did on this day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) soon found the
paragraph alluding to himself in the <div class="bookquote">``Pulpit,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and read it without a
quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) face or the slightest change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) colour. There was
no one to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) now,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was acting under a resolve that at no
moment, either when alone, or in a crowd, or when suddenly called
upon for words,--not even when the policemen with their first hints
of arrest should come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>),--would he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) betray himself by the
working of a single muscle, or the loss of a drop of blood from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would go through it, always armed, without a sign of
shrinking. It had to be done, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would do it.

<p/>At ten he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) walked down to the central committee-room at Whitehall
Place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would face the world better by walking
than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) were taken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own brougham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) gave orders that the
carriage should be at the committee-room at eleven, and wait an
hour for him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was not there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) went along Bond Street and
Piccadilly, Regent Street and through Pall Mall to Charing Cross,
with the blandly triumphant smile of a man who had successfully
entertained the great guest of the day. As he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) got near the club he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>)
met two or three men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) knew, and bowed to them. They returned
his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) bow graciously enough, but not one of them stopped to speak to
him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>). Of one he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) would have stopped, had it not been for
the rumour. Even after the man had passed on he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was careful to show
no displeasure on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would take it all as it would come
and still be the blandly triumphant Merchant Prince,--as long as the
police would allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) probably was not aware how very different
was the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was now playing from that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had assumed at the
India Office.

<p/>At the committee-room he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) only found a few understrappers, and was
informed that everything was going on regularly. The electors
were balloting; but with the ballot,--so said the leader of the
understrappers,--there never was any excitement. The men looked
half-frightened,--as though they did not quite know whether they
ought to seize their candidate, and hold him (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) till the constable came.
They certainly had not expected to see him (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) there. <div class="bookquote">``Has Lord Alfred
been here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Melmotte asked, standing in the inner room with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
back to the empty grate. No,--Lord Alfred had not been there. <div class="bookquote">``Nor
Mr. Grendall?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>The senior understrapper knew that Melmotte would
have asked for <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) Secretary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>and not for Mr. Grendall, but for
the rumours. It is so hard not to tumble into Scylla when you are
avoiding Charybdis. Mr. Grendall had not been there. Indeed, nobody
had been there. <div class="bookquote">``In fact, there is nothing more to be done, I
suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte. The senior understrapper thought that
there was nothing more to be done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) left word that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brougham
should be sent away, and strolled out again on foot.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went up into Covent Garden, where there was a polling booth. The
place seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), as one of the chief centres for a contested
election, to be wonderfully quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was determined to face
everybody and everything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went close up to the booth. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
was recognised by various men, mechanics chiefly, who came forward
and shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) remained there for an hour conversing
with people, and at last made a speech to a little knot around him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not allude to the rumour of yesterday, nor to the paragraph
in the <div class="bookquote">``Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) name had not been attached; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
spoke freely enough of the general accusations that had been brought
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) previously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wished the electors to understand that
nothing which had been said against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ashamed to meet them
here or elsewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) position, and proud that the
electors of Westminster should recognise it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was glad
to say, know much of the law, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was told that the law would
protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) from such aspersions as had been unfairly thrown upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) flattered himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was too good an Englishman to
regard the ordinary political attacks to which candidates were, as
a matter of course, subject at elections;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could stretch his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
back to bear perhaps a little more than these, particularly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
looked forward to a triumphant return. But things had been said, and
published, which the excitement of an election could not justify,
and as to these things he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must have recourse to the law. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
made some allusion to the Princes and the Emperor, and concluded
by observing that it was the proudest boast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) life to be an
Englishman and a Londoner.

<p/>It was asserted afterwards that this was the only good speech he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had
ever been known to make; and it was certainly successful, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) was
applauded throughout Covent Garden. A reporter for the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast
Table''  (<font color='red'><b>A reporter</b></font>)</div>who was on duty at the place, looking for paragraphs as to
the conduct of electors, gave an account of the speech in that paper,
and made more of it, perhaps, than it deserved. It was asserted
afterwards, and given as a great proof of Melmotte's cleverness,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had planned the thing and gone to Covent Garden all alone
having considered that in that way could he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) best regain a step in
reputation; but in truth the affair had not been preconcerted. It was
while in Whitehall Place that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had first thought of going to Covent
Garden, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had had no idea of making a speech till the people had
gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/>It was then noon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had to determine what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should do next. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
was half inclined to go round to all the booths and make speeches.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) success at Covent Garden had been very pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might not be so successful elsewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had shown
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not afraid of the electors. Then an idea struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would go boldly into the City,--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own offices in Abchurch
Lane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had determined to be absent on this day, and would not be
expected. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) appearance there could not on that account be taken
amiss. Whatever enmities there might be, or whatever perils, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would
face them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) got a cab therefore and had himself driven to Abchurch
Lane.

<p/>The clerks were hanging about doing nothing, as though it were a
holiday. The dinner, the election, and the rumour together had
altogether demoralized them. But some of them at least were there,
and they showed no signs of absolute insubordination. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Grendall
has not been here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) asked. No; Mr. Grendall had not been there;
but Mr. Cohenlupe was in Mr. Grendall's room. At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)
hardly desired to see Mr. Cohenlupe. That gentleman was privy to
many of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) transactions, but was by no means privy to them all.
Mr. Cohenlupe knew that the estate at Pickering had been purchased,
and knew that it had been mortgaged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) knew also what had become
of the money which had so been raised. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) knew nothing of the
circumstances of the purchase, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) probably surmised that
Melmotte had succeeded in getting the title-deeds on credit, without
paying the money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could hardly see Cohenlupe
and hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) tongue, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) could not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) without
danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) and Cohenlupe might have to stand in a dock together;
and Cohenlupe had none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) spirit. But the clerks would think,
and would talk, were he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) to leave the office without seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) old
friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) went therefore into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) own room, and called to Cohenlupe
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) did so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ve didn't expect you here to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>the member</b></font>)</div>said the member for Staines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor did I expect to come. But there isn't much to do at Westminster
while the ballot is going on; so I came up, just to look at the
letters. The dinner went off pretty well yesterday, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncommon;--nothing better. Vy did the Lord Mayor stay away,
Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>)'s an ass and a cur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte with an assumed
air of indignation. <div class="bookquote">``Alf and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) people had got hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>). There
was ever so much fuss about it at first,--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) would accept the
invitation. I say it was an insult to the City to take it and not to
come. I shall be even with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) some of these days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things will go on just the same as usual, Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on. Of course they'll go. What's to hinder them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's ever so much been said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>whispered Cohenlupe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Said;--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Melmotte very loudly. <div class="bookquote">``You're not such a
fool, I hope, as to believe every word you hear. You'll have enough
to believe, if you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no knowing vat anybody does know, and vat anybody does not
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Cohenlupe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look you here, Cohenlupe,'' (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>--and now Melmotte also sank his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) voice to
a whisper,--<div class="bookquote">``keep your tongue in your mouth; go about just as usual,
and say nothing. It's all right. There has been some heavy pulls upon
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, there has indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But any paper with my name to it will come right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nothing;--nothing at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Cohenlupe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there is nothing;--nothing at all! I've bought some property and
have paid for it; and I have bought some, and have not yet paid for
it. There's no fraud in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,--nothing in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You hold your tongue, and go about your business. I'm going to the
bank now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>Cohenlupe had been very low in spirits, and was still low
in spirits; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) was somewhat better after the visit of the great
man to the City.

<p/>Mr. Melmotte was as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) word and walked straight to the bank.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) kept two accounts at different banks, one for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) business, and
one for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) private affairs. The one he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) now entered was that which
kept what we may call his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) domestic account. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) walked straight
through, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) old fashion, to the room behind the bank in which
sat the manager and the manager's one clerk, and stood upon the rug
before the fire-place just as though nothing had happened,--or as
nearly as though nothing had happened as was within the compass of
his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) powers. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) could not quite do it. In keeping up an appearance
intended to be natural he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) was obliged to be somewhat milder than his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>)
wont. The manager did not behave nearly as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) did, and the
clerks manifestly betrayed their emotion. Melmotte saw that it was
so;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had expected it, and had come there on purpose to <div class="bookquote">``put it
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We hardly expected to see you in the City to-day, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I didn't expect to see myself here. But it always happens that
when one expects that there's most to be done, there's nothing to
be done at all. They're all at work down at Westminster, balloting;
but as I can't go on voting for myself, I'm of no use. I've been at
Covent Garden this morning, making a stump speech, and if all that
they say there is true, I haven't much to be afraid of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the dinner went off pretty well?''  (<font color='red'><b>the manager</b></font>)</div>asked the manager.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, indeed. They say the Emperor liked it better than
anything that has been done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was a brilliant flash
of imagination. <div class="bookquote">``For a friend to dine with me every day, you know,
I should prefer somebody who had a little more to say for himself.
But then, perhaps, you know, if you or I were in China we shouldn't
have much to say for ourselves;--eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>The manager</b></font>)</div>The manager acceded to this
proposition. <div class="bookquote">``We had one awful disappointment. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lordship from over
the way didn't come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord Mayor, you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord Mayor didn't come! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) was frightened at the last
moment;--took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) head that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) authority in the City was
somehow compromised. But the wonder was that the dinner went on
without him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Then Melmotte referred to the purport of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) call there
that day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have to draw large cheques for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) private wants.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't give a dinner to an Emperor of China for nothing, you
know.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been in the habit of over-drawing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) private
account,--making arrangements with the manager. But now, in the
manager's presence, he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) drew a regular cheque on his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) business account
for a large sum, and then, as a sort of afterthought, paid in the
#250 which he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) had received from Mr. Broune on account of the money
which Sir Felix had taken from Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There don't seem much the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the manager</b></font>)</div>said the manager, when
Melmotte had left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) brazens it out, don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the senior clerk. But the feeling
of the room after full discussion inclined to the opinion that the
rumours had been a political manoeuvre. Nevertheless, Mr. Melmotte
would not now have been allowed to overdraw at the present moment.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIV.

<p/>THE ELECTION.


<p/>Mr. Alf's central committee-room was in Great George Street, and
there the battle was kept alive all the day. It had been decided, as
the reader has been told, that no direct advantage should be taken
of that loud blast of accusation which had been heard throughout the
town on the previous afternoon. There had not been sufficient time
for inquiry as to the truth of that blast. If there were just ground
for the things that had been said, Mr. Melmotte would no doubt soon
be in gaol, or would be--wanted. Many had thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would
escape as soon as the dinner was over, and had been disappointed
when they heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been seen walking down towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
committee-room on the following morning. Others had been told that at
the last moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) name would be withdrawn,--and a question arose
as to whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had the legal power to withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) name after a
certain hour on the day before the ballot. An effort was made to
convince a portion of the electors that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had withdrawn, or would
have withdrawn, or should have withdrawn. When Melmotte was at Covent
Garden, a large throng of men went to Whitehall Place with the view
of ascertaining the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) certainly had made no attempt at
withdrawal. They who propagated this report certainly damaged Mr.
Alf's cause. A second reaction set in, and there grew a feeling that
Mr. Melmotte was being ill-used. Those evil things had been said
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--many at least so declared,--not from any true motive, but
simply to secure Mr. Alf's return. Tidings of the speech in Covent
Garden were spread about at the various polling places, and did
good service to the so-called Conservative cause. Mr. Alf's friends,
hearing all this, instigated him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) also to make a speech. Something
should be said, if only that it might be reported in the newspapers,
to show that they had behaved with generosity, instead of having
injured their enemy by false attacks. Whatever Mr. Alf might say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
might at any rate be sure of a favourable reporter.

<p/>About two o'clock in the day, Mr. Alf did make a speech,--and a very
good speech it was, if correctly reported in the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Alf was a clever man, ready at all points, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) powers
immediately at command, and, no doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) did make a good speech.
But in this speech, in which we may presume that it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
intention to convince the electors that they ought to return him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) to
Parliament, because, of the two candidates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) was the fittest to
represent their views, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) did not say a word as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) own political
ideas, not, indeed, a word that could be accepted as manifesting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) own fitness for the place which it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) ambition to fill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
contented himself with endeavouring to show that the other man was
not fit;--and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends, though solicitous of proving
to the electors that Mr. Melmotte was about the most unfit man in the
world, had been guilty of nothing shabby in their manner of doing so.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``comes before you as a Conservative, and
has told us, by the mouths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) friends,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has not favoured
us with many words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is supported by the whole
Conservative party. That party is not my party, but I respect it.
Where, however, are these Conservative supporters? We have heard,
till we are sick of it, of the banquet which Mr. Melmotte gave
yesterday. I am told that very few of those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) calls his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
Conservative friends could be induced to attend that banquet. It is
equally notorious that the leading merchants of the City refused
to grace the table of this great commercial prince. I say that the
leaders of the Conservative party have at last found their candidate
out, have repudiated him (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>);--and are seeking now to free themselves
from the individual shame of having supported the candidature of such
a man by remaining in their own houses instead of clustering round
the polling booths. Go to Mr. Melmotte's committee-room and inquire
if those leading Conservatives be there. Look about, and see whether
they are walking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) in the streets, or standing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) in
public places, or taking the air with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) in the parks. I respect
the leaders of the Conservative party; but they have made a mistake
in this matter, and they know it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ended by alluding to the
rumours of yesterday. <div class="bookquote">``I scorn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to say anything against
the personal character of a political opponent, which I am not in
a position to prove. I make no allusion, and have made no allusion,
to reports which were circulated yesterday about him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>), and which I
believe were originated in the City. They may be false or they may
be true. As I know nothing of the matter, I prefer to regard them as
false, and I recommend you to do the same. But I declared to you long
before these reports were in men's mouths, that Mr. Melmotte was
not entitled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) character to represent you in parliament, and I
repeat that assertion. A great British merchant, indeed! How long, do
you think, should a man be known in this city before that title be
accorded to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Who knew aught of this man two years since,--unless,
indeed, it be some one who had burnt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wings in trafficking with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in some continental city? Ask the character of this great British
merchant in Hamburg and Vienna; ask it in Paris;--ask those whose
business here has connected them with the assurance companies of
foreign countries, and you will be told whether this is a fit man to
represent Westminster in the British parliament!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was much more
yet; but such was the tone of the speech which Mr. Alf made with the
object of inducing the electors to vote for himself.

<p/>At two or three o'clock in the day, nobody knew how the matter was
going. It was supposed that the working-classes were in favour of
Melmotte, partly from their love of a man who spends a great deal of
money, partly from the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was being ill-used,--partly, no
doubt, from that occult sympathy which is felt for crime, when the
crime committed is injurious to the upper classes. Masses of men will
almost feel that a certain amount of injustice ought to be inflicted
on their betters, so as to make things even, and will persuade
themselves that a criminal should be declared to be innocent, because
the crime committed has had a tendency to oppress the rich and pull
down the mighty from their seats. Some few years since, the basest
calumnies that were ever published in this country, uttered by one
of the basest men that ever disgraced the country, levelled, for the
most part, at men of whose characters and services the country was
proud, were received with a certain amount of sympathy by men not
themselves dishonest, because they who were thus slandered had
received so many good things from Fortune, that a few evil things
were thought to be due to them. There had not as yet been time
for the formation of such a feeling generally, in respect of Mr.
Melmotte. But there was a commencement of it. It had been asserted
that Melmotte was a public robber. Whom had he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) robbed? Not the poor.
There was not a man in London who caused the payment of a larger sum
in weekly wages than Mr. Melmotte.

<p/>About three o'clock, the editor of the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table''
 (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>called on Lady Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``What is it all about?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) asked, as soon
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend was seated. There had been no time for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to explain
anything at Madame Melmotte's reception, and Lady Carbury had as yet
failed in learning any certain news of what was going on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to make of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune. <div class="bookquote">``There is a story
abroad that Mr. Melmotte has forged some document with reference to
a purchase he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) made,--and hanging on to that story are other stories
as to moneys that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has raised. I should say that it was simply an
electioneering trick, and a very unfair trick, were it not that all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own side seem to believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you believe it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,--I could answer almost any question sooner than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) can't be rich at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even that would not follow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has such large concerns in hand that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might be very much pressed for funds, and yet be possessed of
immense wealth. Everybody says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pays all his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) be returned?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From what we hear, we think not. I shall know more about it in an
hour or two. At present I should not like to have to publish an
opinion; but were I forced to bet, I would bet against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Nobody is
doing anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). There can be no doubt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own party are
ashamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). As things used to be, this would have been fatal to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at the day of election; but now, with the ballot, it won't matter
so much. If I were a candidate, at present, I think I would go to bed
on the last day, and beg all my committee to do the same as soon as
they had put in their voting papers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad Felix did not go to Liverpool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not have made much difference. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would have been brought
back all the same. They say Lord Nidderdale still means to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There must be an immense amount of property somewhere. No one doubts
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was rich when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) came to England two years ago, and they

Mexican Railway shares had fallen this morning, but they were at #15
premium yesterday morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) must have made an enormous deal out
of that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>But Mr. Broune's eloquence on this occasion was chiefly
displayed in regard to the presumption of Mr. Alf. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think
him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) such a fool if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) resignation of the editorship
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) came before the world as a candidate for parliament. But a
man must be mad who imagines that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can sit for Westminster and edit
a London daily paper at the same time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it never been done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Never, I think;--that is, by the editor of such a paper as the
``Pulpit.<div class="bookquote">'' How is a man who sits in parliament himself ever to pretend
to discuss the doings of parliament with impartiality? But Alf
believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) can do more than anybody else ever did, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)'ll
come to the ground. Where's Felix now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the poor mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) doing anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) lies in bed all day, and is out all night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that wants money.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You do not give him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have none to give.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should simply take the key of the house from him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>),--or bolt the

that, Mr. Broune. A child has such a hold upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) mother. When her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
reason has bade her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to condemn him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart will not let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) carry
out the sentence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>Mr. Broune never now thought of kissing Lady
Carbury; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) spoke thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) got up and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) hand, had no fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would be kissed.
The feeling between them was changed.

<p/>Melmotte dined at home that evening with no company but that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
wife and daughter. Latterly one of the Grendalls had almost always
joined their party when they did not dine out. Indeed, it was an
understood thing, that Miles Grendall should dine there always,
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) absence by some engagement,--so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)
presence there had come to be considered as a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) duty.
Not unfrequently <div class="bookquote">``Alfred''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>and Miles would both come, as Melmotte's
dinners and wines were good, and occasionally the father would take
the son's place,--but on this day they were both absent. Madame
Melmotte had not as yet said a word to any one indicating her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
apprehension of any evil. But not a person had called to-day,--the
day after the great party,--and even she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was naturally
callous in such matters, had begun to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was deserted.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had, too, become so used to the presence of the Grendalls, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) now missed their company. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that on this day, of all
days, when the world was balloting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) husband at Westminster,
they would both have been with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to discuss the work of the day.
<div class="bookquote">``Is not Mr. Grendall coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) asked, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) seat at the
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) is not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor Lord Alfred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor Lord Alfred.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Melmotte had returned home much comforted by the
day's proceedings. No one had dared to say a harsh word to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face.
Nothing further had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ears. After leaving the bank he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) office, and had written letters,--just as if nothing
had happened; and, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could judge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) clerks had plucked
up courage. One of them, about five o'clock, came into him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) with news
from the west, and with second editions of the evening papers. The
clerk expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) opinion that the election was going well. Mr.
Melmotte, judging from the papers, one of which was supposed to be
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) side and the other of course against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
affairs altogether were looking well. The Westminster election had
not the foremost place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thoughts; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took what was said on
that subject as indicating the minds of men upon the other matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
read Alf's speech, and consoled himself with thinking that Mr. Alf
had not dared to make new accusations against him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>). All that about
Hamburgh and Vienna and Paris was as old as the hills, and availed
nothing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) whole candidature had been carried in the face of that.
<div class="bookquote">``I think we shall do pretty well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) said to the clerk. His (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) very
presence in Abchurch Lane of course gave confidence. And thus, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) came home, something of the old arrogance had come back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) could swagger at any rate before his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) wife and servants. <div class="bookquote">``Nor
Lord Alfred,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) said with scorn. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) added more. <div class="bookquote">``The father and
son are two d-- curs.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>This of course frightened Madame Melmotte,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) joined this desertion of the Grendalls to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own solitude
all the day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything wrong, Melmotte?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said afterwards, creeping up
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) in the back parlour, and speaking in French.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you call wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know;--but I seem to be afraid of something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought you were used to that kind of feeling by this
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there is something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a fool. There is always something. There is always much.
You don't suppose that this kind of thing can be carried on as
smoothly as the life of an old maid with #400 a year paid quarterly
in advance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we have to--move again?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I to tell? You haven't much to do when we move, and may get
plenty to eat and drink wherever you go. Does that girl mean to
marry Lord Nidderdale?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Melmotte shook her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``What a poor
creature you must be when you can't talk her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out of a fancy for such
a reprobate as young Carbury. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throws me over, I'll throw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
over. I'll flog her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) within an inch of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) disobeys me.
You tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that I say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) may flog me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, when so much of the conversation
was repeated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that evening. <div class="bookquote">``Papa does not know me if he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) thinks
that I'm to be made to marry a man by flogging.''  (<font color='red'><b>the father husband</b></font>)</div>No such attempt was
at any rate made that night, for the father and husband did not again
see his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife or daughter.

<p/>Early the next day a report was current that Mr. Alf had been
returned. The numbers had not as yet been counted, or the books made
up;--but that was the opinion expressed. All the morning newspapers,
including the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated this report,--but each gave
it as the general opinion on the matter. The truth would not be known
till seven or eight o'clock in the evening. The Conservative papers
did not scruple to say that the presumed election of Mr. Alf was
owing to a sudden declension in the confidence originally felt in Mr.
Melmotte. The <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>which had supported Mr. Melmotte's
candidature, gave no reason, and expressed more doubt on the result
than the other papers. <div class="bookquote">``We know not how such an opinion forms
itself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the writer</b></font>)</div>the writer said;--<div class="bookquote">``but it seems to have been formed. As
nothing as yet is really known, or can be known, we express no
opinion of our own upon the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the writer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Melmotte again went into the City, and found that things seemed
to have returned very much into their usual grooves. The Mexican
Railway shares were low, and Mr. Cohenlupe was depressed in spirits
and unhappy;--but nothing dreadful had occurred or seemed to be
threatened. If nothing dreadful did occur, the railway shares would
probably recover, or nearly recover, their position. In the course of
the day, Melmotte received a letter from Messrs. Slow and Bideawhile,
which, of itself, certainly contained no comfort;--but there was
comfort to be drawn even from that letter, by reason of what it did
not contain. The letter was unfriendly in its tone and peremptory. It
had come evidently from a hostile party. It had none of the feeling
which had hitherto prevailed in the intercourse between these two
well-known Conservative gentlemen, Mr. Adolphus Longestaffe and Mr.
Augustus Melmotte. But there was no allusion in it to forgery; no
question of criminal proceedings; no hint at aught beyond the not
unnatural desire of Mr. Longestaffe and Mr. Longestaffe's son to be
paid for the property at Pickering which Mr. Melmotte had purchased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have to remind you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the letter, in continuation of
paragraphs which had contained simply demands for the money, <div class="bookquote">``that
the title-deeds were delivered to you on receipt by us of authority
to that effect from the Messrs. Longestaffe, father and son, on the
understanding that the purchase-money was to be at once paid to us
by you. We are informed that the property has been since mortgaged
by you. We do not state this as a fact. But the information, whether
true or untrue, forces upon us the necessity of demanding that you
should at once pay to us the purchase-money,--#80,000,--or else
return to us the title-deeds of the estate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div><p/>This letter, which was signed Slow and Bideawhile, declared
positively that the title-deeds had been given up on authority
received by them from both the Longestaffes,--father and son. Now
the accusation brought against Melmotte, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could as yet
understand it, was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had forged the signature to the young Mr.
Longestaffe's letter. Messrs. Slow and Bideawhile were therefore on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) side. As to the simple debt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) cared little comparatively about
that. Many fine men were walking about London who owed large sums of
money which they could not pay.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) was sitting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) solitary dinner this evening,--for both his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>)
wife and daughter had declined to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>), saying that they had
dined early,--news was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had been elected for
Westminster. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had beaten Mr. Alf by something not much less than a
thousand votes.

<p/>It was very much to be member for Westminster. So much had at any
rate been achieved by him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) who had begun the world without a shilling
and without a friend,--almost without education! Much as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) loved
money, and much as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) loved the spending of money, and much as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
made and much as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had spent, no triumph of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life had been so
great to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as this. Brought into the world in a gutter, without
father or mother, with no good thing ever done for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was now
a member of the British Parliament, and member for one of the first
cities in the empire. Ignorant as he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) understood the magnitude
of the achievement, and dismayed as he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was as to his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) present
position, still at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) enjoyed keenly a certain amount
of elation. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had committed forgery;--of course he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had
committed robbery. That, indeed, was nothing, for he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had been
cheating and forging and stealing all his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) life. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was in
danger of almost immediate detection and punishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) hardly hoped
that the evil day would be very much longer protracted, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) triumph. Whatever they might do, quick as they might
be, they could hardly prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) taking his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) seat in the House
of Commons. Then if they sent him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) to penal servitude for life,
they would have to say that they had so treated the member for
Westminster!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) drank a bottle of claret, and then got some brandy-and-water.
In such troubles as were coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) now, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) would hardly
get sufficient support from wine. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had better not
drink;--that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had better not drink, supposing the world to
be free to him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own work and his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own enjoyment. But if the
world were no longer free to him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) were really coming to penal
servitude and annihilation,--then why should he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) not drink while the
time lasted? An hour of triumphant joy might be an eternity to a man,
if the man's imagination were strong enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so regard his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) therefore took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brandy-and-water freely, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took
it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was able to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fears behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and to assure himself
that, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might even yet escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bondages. No;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would drink no more. This he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) filled another
beaker. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would work instead. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder to the
wheel, and would yet conquer his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemies. It would not be so easy to
convict a member for Westminster,--especially if money were spent
freely. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) not the man who, at his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own cost, had entertained the
Emperor of China? Would not that be remembered in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) favour? Would
not men be unwilling to punish the man who had received at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
table all the Princes of the land, and the Prime Minister, and all
the Ministers? To convict him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) would be a national disgrace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) fully
realised all this as he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) lifted the glass to his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) mouth, and puffed out
the smoke in large volumes through his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) lips. But money must be spent!
Yes;--money must be had! Cohenlupe certainly had money. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)
squeezed it out of the coward's veins he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) would have it. At any rate,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) would not despair. There was a fight to be fought yet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)
would fight it to the end. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) took a deep drink, and slowly,
with careful and almost solemn steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) way up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) bed.




<p/>CHAPTER LXV.

<p/>MISS LONGESTAFFE WRITES HOME.


<p/>Lady Monogram, when she (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) left Madame Melmotte's house after that
entertainment of Imperial Majesty which had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) of so very
little avail, was not in a good humour. Sir Damask, who had himself
affected to laugh at the whole thing, but who had been in truth as
anxious as his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) wife to see the Emperor in private society, put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
ladyship and Miss Longestaffe into the carriage without a word, and
rushed off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) club in disgust. The affair from beginning to end,
including the final failure, had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) wife's doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) had been
made to work like a slave, and had been taken against his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) will to
Melmotte's house, and had seen no Emperor and shaken hands with no
Prince! <div class="bookquote">``They may fight it out between them now like the Kilkenny
cats.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) idea as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) closed the carriage-door on the two
ladies,--thinking that if a larger remnant were left of one cat than
of the other that larger remnant would belong to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a horrid affair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monogram. <div class="bookquote">``Did anybody ever see
anything so vulgar?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>This was at any rate unreasonable, for whatever
vulgarity there may have been, Lady Monogram had seen none of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why you were so late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Late! Why it's not yet twelve. I don't suppose it was eleven when we
got into the Square. Anywhere else it would have been early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew they did not mean to stay long. It was particularly said
so. I really think it was your own fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My own fault. Yes;--I don't doubt that. I know it was my own fault,
my dear, to have had anything to do with it. And now I have got to
pay for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by paying for it, Julia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what I mean very well. Is your friend going to do us the
honour of coming to us to-morrow night?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could not have declared
in plainer language how very high she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) thought the price to be which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had consented to give for those ineffective tickets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean Mr. Brehgert, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) is coming. You desired me to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>),
and I did so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Desired you! The truth is, Georgiana, when people get into different
sets, they'd better stay where they are. It's no good trying to mix
things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>Lady Monogram was so angry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) could not control her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>)
tongue.

<p/>Miss Longestaffe was ready to tear herself with indignation. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
should have been brought to hear insolence such as this from Julia
Triplex,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>), the daughter of Adolphus Longestaffe of Caversham and
Lady Pomona; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>), who was considered to have lived in quite the first
London circle! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) could hardly get hold of fit words for a
reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was almost in tears, and was yet anxious to fight rather
than weep. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) friend's carriage, and was being taken
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) friend's house, was to be entertained by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) friend all the
next day, and was to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) lover among her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) friend's guests. <div class="bookquote">``I
wonder what has made you so ill-natured,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``You
didn't use to be like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good abusing me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monogram. <div class="bookquote">``Here we are, and
I suppose we had better get out,--unless you want the carriage to
take you anywhere else.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>Then Lady Monogram got out and marched into
the house, and taking a candle went direct to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) own room. Miss
Longestaffe followed slowly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own chamber, and having half
undressed herself, dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) maid and prepared to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
mother.

<p/>The letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mother must be written. Mr. Brehgert had twice
proposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) should, in the usual way, go to Mr. Longestaffe,
who had been backwards and forwards in London, and was there at the
present moment. Of course it was proper that Mr. Brehgert should see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father,--but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) preferred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) should
postpone his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) visit for a day or two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was now agonized by many
doubts. Those few words about <div class="bookquote">``various sets''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``mixing of
things''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div>had stabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) to the very heart,--as had been intended. Mr.
Brehgert was rich. That was a certainty. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) already repented of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had done. If it were necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) should really go
down into another and a much lower world, a world composed altogether
of Brehgerts, Melmottes, and Cohenlupes, would it avail her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) much to
be the mistress of a gorgeous house? She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had known, and understood,
and had revelled in the exclusiveness of county position. Caversham
had been dull, and there had always been there a dearth of young
men of the proper sort; but it had been a place to talk of, and to
feel satisfied with as a home to be acknowledged before the world.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mother was dull, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father pompous and often cross; but
they were in the right set,--miles removed from the Brehgerts and
Melmottes,--until her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father himself had suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
should go to the house in Grosvenor Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would write one
letter to-night; but there was a question in her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mind whether the
letter should be written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mother telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) the horrid
truth,--or to Mr. Brehgert begging that the match should be broken
off. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would have decided on the latter had it not been
that so many people had already heard of the match. The Monograms
knew it, and had of course talked far and wide. The Melmottes knew
it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was aware that Lord Nidderdale had heard it. It was
already so far known that it was sure to be public before the end of
the season. Each morning lately she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had feared that a letter from
home would call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) to explain the meaning of some frightful
rumours reaching Caversham, or that her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) and
with horror on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face demand to know whether it was indeed true
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) sanction to so abominable a report.

<p/>And there were other troubles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had just spoken to Madame Melmotte
this evening, having met her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) late hostess as she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) entered the
drawing-room, and had felt from the manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) reception that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was not wanted back again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was
going to transfer herself to the Monograms for a time, not mentioning
the proposed duration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) visit, and Mr. Longestaffe, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
ambiguous way, had expressed himself glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was leaving the
Melmottes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) did not think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) could go back to Grosvenor
Square, although Mr. Brehgert desired it. Since the expression of
Mr. Brehgert's wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had perceived that ill-will had grown up
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father and Mr. Melmotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) must return to Caversham.
They could not refuse to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) in, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had betrothed
herself to a Jew!

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) decided that the story should be told to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) mother it would
be easier to tell it by letter than by spoken words, face to face.
But then if she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) wrote the letter there would be no retreat,--and how
should she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) face her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) family after such a declaration? She (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had always
given herself credit for courage, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own
cowardice. Even Lady Monogram, her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) old friend Julia Triplex, had
trampled upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>). Was it not the business of her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) life, in these
days, to do the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) could for herself, and would she (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) allow
paltry considerations as to the feelings of others to stand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>)
way and become bugbears to affright her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>)? Who sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) to Melmotte's
house? Was it not her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) own father? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) sat herself square at the
table, and wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) mother,--as follows,--dating her (<font color='blue'><b>Triplex</b></font>) letter for
the following morning:--


<p/>Hill Street,
9th July, 187--.

<p/>MY DEAR MAMMA,

<p/>I am afraid you will be very much astonished by this
letter, and perhaps disappointed. I have engaged myself to
Mr. Brehgert, a member of a very wealthy firm in the City,
called Todd, Brehgert, and Goldsheiner. I may as well tell
you the worst at once. Mr. Brehgert is a Jew.

<p/>This last word she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) wrote very rapidly, but largely, determined that
there should be no lack of courage apparent in the letter.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) is a very wealthy man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) business is about
banking and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) calls finance. I understand they are
among the most leading people in the City. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) lives at
present at a very handsome house at Fulham. I don't know
that I ever saw a place more beautifully fitted up. I have
said nothing to papa, nor has he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will be
willing to satisfy papa perfectly as to settlements. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
has offered to have a house in London if I like,--and
also to keep the villa at Fulham or else to have a place
somewhere in the country. Or I may have the villa at
Fulham and a house in the country. No man can be more
generous than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been married before, and has a
family, and now I think I have told you all.

<p/>I suppose you and papa will be very much dissatisfied. I
hope papa won't refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) consent. It can do no good. I
am not going to remain as I am now all my life, and there
is no use waiting any longer. It was papa who made me go
to the Melmottes, who are not nearly so well placed as
Mr. Brehgert. Everybody knows that Madame Melmotte is a
Jewess, and nobody knows what Mr. Melmotte is. It is no
good going on with the old thing when everything seems to
be upset and at sixes and sevens. If papa has got to be so
poor that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is obliged to let the house in town, one must
of course expect to be different from what we were.

<p/>I hope you won't mind having me back the day after
to-morrow,--that is to-morrow, Wednesday. There is a party
here to-night, and Mr. Brehgert is coming. But I can't
stay longer with Julia, who doesn't make herself nice,
and I do not at all want to go back to the Melmottes. I
fancy that there is something wrong between papa and Mr.
Melmotte.

<p/>Send the carriage to meet me by the 2.30 train from
London,--and pray, mamma, don't scold when you see me, or
have hysterics, or anything of that sort. Of course it
isn't all nice, but things have got so that they never
will be nice again. I shall tell Mr. Brehgert to go to
papa on Wednesday.

<p/>Your affectionate daughter,

<p/>G.


<p/>When the morning came she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) desired the servant to take the letter away
and have it posted, so that the temptation to stop it might no longer
be in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) way.

<p/>About one o'clock on that day Mr. Longestaffe called at Lady
Monogram's. The two ladies had breakfasted up-stairs, and had only
just met in the drawing-room when he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) came in. Georgiana trembled at
first, but soon perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father had as yet heard nothing of
Mr. Brehgert. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) immediately told him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) proposed returning
home on the following day. <div class="bookquote">``I am sick of the Melmottes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe, with a serious countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We should have been delighted to have had Georgiana to stay with
us a little longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monogram; <div class="bookquote">``but we have but the one
spare bedroom, and another friend is coming.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>Georgiana, who knew
both these statements to be false, declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) wouldn't
think of such a thing. <div class="bookquote">``We have a few friends coming to-night, Mr.
Longestaffe, and I hope you'll come in and see Georgiana.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Longestaffe hummed and hawed and muttered something, as old gentlemen
always do when they are asked to go out to parties after dinner.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brehgert will be here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Monogram with a peculiar
smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. who?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>The name was not at first familiar to Mr. Longestaffe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brehgert.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>Lady Monogram looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``I hope I'm not
revealing any secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand anything about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe.
<div class="bookquote">``Georgiana, who is Mr. Brehgert?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had understood very much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
had been quite certain from Lady Monogram's manner and words, and
also from his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) daughter's face, that Mr. Brehgert was mentioned as an
accepted lover. Lady Monogram had meant that it should be so, and
any father would have understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) tone. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) said afterwards to
Sir Damask, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) was not going to have that Jew there at her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) house
as Georgiana Longestaffe's accepted lover without Mr. Longestaffe's
knowledge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Georgiana,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I supposed your father knew all about
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing. Georgiana, I hate a mystery. I insist upon knowing.
Who is Mr. Brehgert, Lady Monogram?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brehgert is a--very wealthy gentleman. That is all I know of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>). Perhaps, Georgiana, you will be glad to be alone with your
father.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>And Lady Monogram left the room.

<p/>Was there ever cruelty equal to this! But now the poor girl was
forced to speak,--though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not speak as boldly as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
written. <div class="bookquote">``Papa, I wrote to mamma this morning, and Mr. Brehgert was
to come to you to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you are engaged to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't mean the fat Jew whom I've met with Mr. Melmotte;--a man
old enough to be your father!''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The poor girl's condition now was
certainly lamentable. The fat Jew, old enough to be her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, was
the very man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did mean. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would try to brazen
it out with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father. But at the present moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been so
cowed by the manner in which the subject had been introduced that
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know how to begin to be bold. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as
though imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Is the man a Jew?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr.
Longestaffe, with as much thunder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) knew how to throw into his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is that fat man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And nearly as old as I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa,--not nearly as old as you are. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a Jew?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) again asked the horrid question, and again threw in
the thunder. On this occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) condescended to make no further
reply. <div class="bookquote">``If you do, you shall do it as an alien from my house. I
certainly will never see him (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>). Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>) not to come to me, for I
certainly will not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>). You are degraded and disgraced; but
you shall not degrade and disgrace me and your mother and sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was you, papa, who told me to go to the Melmottes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not true. I wanted you to stay at Caversham. A Jew! an old
fat Jew! Heavens and earth! that it should be possible that you
should think of it! You;--my daughter,--that used to take such pride

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will kill her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It will simply kill her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). And you are going home

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wrote to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there you must remain. I suppose I had better see the man and
explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that it is utterly impossible. Heavens on earth;--a
Jew! An old fat Jew! My daughter! I will take you down home myself
to-morrow. What have I done that I should be punished by my children
in this way?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The poor man had had rather a stormy interview with
Dolly that morning. <div class="bookquote">``You had better leave this house to-day, and come
to my hotel in Jermyn Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, I can't do that.''

come, I will send for Lady Monogram and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) that I will not
permit you to meet Mr. Brehgert at her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) house. I do wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>). A

walked about the room in despair.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) did consent, knowing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) father and Lady Monogram between
them would be too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) things packed up, and
in the course of the afternoon allowed herself to be carried away.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said one word to Lady Monogram before she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) went. <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) that I
was called away suddenly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, my dear. I thought your papa would not like it.''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The poor
girl had not spirit sufficient to upbraid her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) friend; nor did it suit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) now to acerbate an enemy. For the moment, at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) must
yield to everybody and everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) spent a lonely evening with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) father in a dull sitting-room in the hotel, hardly speaking or
spoken to, and the following day she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) was taken down to Caversham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>)
believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) father had seen Mr. Brehgert on the morning of that
day;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) said no word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>), nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) any question.

<p/>That was on the day after Lady Monogram's party. Early in the
evening, just as the gentlemen were coming up from the dining-room,
Mr. Brehgert, apparelled with much elegance, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) appearance.
Lady Monogram received him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) with a sweet smile. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Longestaffe,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``has left me and gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Monogram/LADY MONOGRAM/Monogram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Monogram, bowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) head, and then attending to
other persons as they arrived. Nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) condescend to speak
another word to Mr. Brehgert, or to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>)
husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) stood for about ten minutes inside the drawing-room,
leaning against the wall, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) departed. No one had spoken a
word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was an even-tempered, good-humoured man. When
Miss Longestaffe was his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) wife things would no doubt be different;--or
else she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) would probably change her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) acquaintance.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``SO SHALL BE MY ENMITY.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall be troubled no more with Winifrid Hurtle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>So Mrs. Hurtle
had said, speaking in perfect good faith to the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
come to England with the view of marrying. And then when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said
good-bye to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to take hers for the last time,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) declined that. <div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had said; <div class="bookquote">``this parting will bear no
farewell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Having left her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) after that fashion Paul Montague could not return
home with very high spirits. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taking that
letter with the threat of the horsewhip as the letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
intended to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--that letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
owning it to be the ebullition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) uncontrolled passion, and
had then destroyed,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might at any rate have consoled himself
with thinking that, however badly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have behaved, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
conduct had been worse than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have made himself warm and
comfortable with anger, and could have assured himself that under any
circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be right to escape from the clutches of a wild
cat such as that. But at the last moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had shown that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was
no wild cat to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had melted, and become soft and womanly. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) softness she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had been exquisitely beautiful; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned
home he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sad and dissatisfied with himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had destroyed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) life for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>),--or, at least, had created a miserable episode
in it which could hardly be obliterated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was
all alone, and had given up everything to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). Was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) now? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
to go, and after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) fashion had pardoned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the wrong he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). But was that to be sufficient for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might now
feel inwardly satisfied at leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), and make no further inquiry
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) fate? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pass on and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) be as the wine that has
been drunk,--as the hour that has been enjoyed,--as the day that is
past?

<p/>But what could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made good his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own escape. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
resolved that, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) be woman or wild cat, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), and in that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been right. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) antecedents, as now
declared by herself, unfitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) for such a marriage. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be again thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand into the fire.
But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own selfish coldness was hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that
there was nothing to be done but to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) desolate and lonely in
Mrs. Pipkin's lodgings.

<p/>During the next three or four days, while the preparations for the
dinner and the election were going on, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was busy in respect to
the American railway. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again went down to Liverpool, and at Mr.
Ramsbottom's advice prepared a letter to the board of directors, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) resigned his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) seat, and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) reasons for resigning it;
adding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) should reserve to himself the liberty of publishing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) letter, should at any time the circumstances of the railway
company seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) to make such a course desirable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) also wrote a
letter to Mr. Fisker, begging that gentleman to come to England, and
expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) own wish to retire altogether from the firm of Fisker,
Montague, and Montague upon receiving the balance of money due to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>),--a payment which must, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) said, be a matter of small moment to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) two partners, if, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had been informed, they had enriched
themselves by the success of the railway company in San Francisco.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) wrote these letters at Liverpool the great rumour about
Melmotte had not yet sprung up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) returned to London on the day
of the festival, and first heard of the report at the Beargarden.
There he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found that the old set had for the moment broken itself up.
Sir Felix Carbury had not been heard of for the last four or five
days,--and then the whole story of Miss Melmotte's journey, of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had read something in the newspapers, was told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We think
that Carbury has drowned himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Lord Grasslough, <div class="bookquote">``and I
haven't heard of anybody being heartbroken about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>Lord Nidderdale
had hardly been seen at the club. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s taken up the running with the
girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Lord Grasslough. <div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll do now, nobody knows. If I
was at it, I'd have the money down in hard cash before I went into
the church. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was there at the party yesterday, talking to the girl
all the night;--a sort of thing he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never did before. Nidderdale is
the best fellow going, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was always an ass.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles Grendall/Miles/Mr. Grendall</b></font>)</div>Nor had Miles
Grendall been seen in the club for three days. <div class="bookquote">``We've got into a way
of play the poor fellow doesn't like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Lord Grasslough; <div class="bookquote">``and
then Melmotte won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has taken to dine
there every day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>This was said during the election,--on the very day
on which Miles deserted his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) patron; and on that evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) did dine
at the club. Paul Montague also dined there, and would fain have
heard something from Grendall as to Melmotte's condition; but the
secretary, if not faithful in all things, was faithful at any rate in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) silence. Though Grasslough talked openly enough about Melmotte in
the smoking-room Miles Grendall said never a word.

<p/>On the next day, early in the afternoon, almost without a fixed
purpose, Montague strolled up to Welbeck Street, and found Hetta
alone. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma has gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) publisher's,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is writing
so much now that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is always going there. Who has been elected,
Mr. Montague?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul knew nothing about the election, and cared very
little. At that time, however, the election had not been decided. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose it will make no difference to you whether your chairman be in
Parliament or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul said that Melmotte was no longer a chairman
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Are you out of it altogether, Mr. Montague?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes;--as far as
it lay within his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) power to be out of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was out of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not
like Mr. Melmotte, nor believe in him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Then with considerable warmth
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) repudiated all connection with the Melmotte party, expressing
deep regret that circumstances had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) for a time into that
alliance. <div class="bookquote">``Then you think that Mr. Melmotte is--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a scoundrel;--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You heard about Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was to marry the girl, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) tried
to run off with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I don't know much about it. They say that Lord
Nidderdale is to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not, Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) sake. At any rate, your brother is well out of
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loves Felix? There is no pretence about that. I
do think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is good. The other night at the party she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You went to the party, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I could not refuse to go when mamma chose to take me. And when
I was there she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke to me about Felix. I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) will marry
Lord Nidderdale. Poor girl;--I do pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). Think what a downfall it
will be if anything happens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>But Paul Montague had certainly not come there with the intention
of discussing Melmotte's affairs, nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) afford to lose the
opportunity which chance had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was off with one love, and
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might be on with the other. <div class="bookquote">``Hetta,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``I am thinking more of myself than of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>),--or even of Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we all do think more of ourselves than of other people,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, who knew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) voice at once what it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind
to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--but I am not thinking of myself only. I am thinking of myself,
and you. In all my thoughts of myself I am thinking of you too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know why you should do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hetta, you must know that I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) knew it. And of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) thought
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was equally sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) love. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) chosen to read signs
that ought to have been plain enough to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), could he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) have doubted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) love after the few words that had been spoken on that night
when Lady Carbury had come in with Roger and interrupted them? She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
could not remember exactly what had been said; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did remember
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had spoken of leaving England for ever in a certain event,
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>);--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) remembered also how she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had confessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), of course, had known
nothing of that confession; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) must have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
heart! So at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been working some morsel of
lace, as ladies do when ladies wish to be not quite doing nothing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had endeavoured to ply her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) needle, very idly, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was
speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hands to fall into her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lap.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would have continued to work at the lace had she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) been able, but
there are times when the eyes will not see clearly, and when the
hands will hardly act mechanically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--I do. Hetta, say a word to me. Can it be so? Look at me for
one moment so as to let me know.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes had turned downwards after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``If Roger is dearer to you than I am, I will go at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger is very dear to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as I would have you love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) paused for a time, knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes were fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) answered the question in a low voice, but very clearly.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said;--<div class="bookquote">``not like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you love me like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) put out both his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) arms as though to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) breast should the answer be such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) longed to
hear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), as if to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) back, and
left it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) seized it. <div class="bookquote">``Is it mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) feet in a moment, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hands and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) dress,
looking up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes full of tears, ecstatic with
joy as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had really never ventured to hope for such success.
<div class="bookquote">``Want it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Hetta, I have never wanted anything but that
with real desire. Oh, Hetta, my own. Since I first saw you this has
been my only dream of happiness. And now it is my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was very quiet, but full of joy. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the
truth she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not coy her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) love. Having once spoken the word she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did
not care how often she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) repeated it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could
ever have loved anybody but him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),--even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not been fond of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). As to Roger,--dear Roger, dearest Roger,--no; it was not the
same thing. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is as good as gold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``ever so much better
than you are, Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand and looking into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better than anybody I have ever known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Montague with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
energy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is;--but, ah, that is not everything. I suppose we ought
to love the best people best; but I don't, Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,--you don't. You must love me best, but I won't be called good.
I do not know why it has been so. Do you know, Paul, I have sometimes
thought I would do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would have me, out of sheer gratitude. I did
not know how to refuse such a trifling thing to one who ought to have
everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where should I have been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you! Somebody else would have made you happy. But do you know,
Paul, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will never love any one else. I ought not to say so,
because it seems to be making so much of myself. But I feel it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is
not so young a man, and yet I think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) never was in love before.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) almost told me so once, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) says is true. There is an
unchanging way with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that is awful to think of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
never could be happy unless I would do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would have me,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
made me almost believe even that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) speaks as though every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
says must come true in the end. Oh, Paul, I love you so dearly,--but
I almost think that I ought to have obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul Montague of
course had very much to say in answer to this. Among the holy things
which did exist to gild this every-day unholy world, love was the
holiest. It should be soiled by no falsehood, should know nothing of
compromises, should admit no excuses, should make itself subject to
no external circumstances. If Fortune had been so kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) heart, poor as his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) claim might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could have no
right to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) love. And though his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) rival
were an angel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could have no shadow of a claim upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),--seeing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had failed to win her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) heart. It was very well said,--at least
so Hetta thought,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) made no attempt at argument against him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).
But what was to be done in reference to poor Roger? She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had spoken
the word now, and, whether for good or bad, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had given herself to
Paul Montague. Even though Roger should have to walk disconsolate
to the grave, it could not now be helped. But would it not be right
that it should be told? <div class="bookquote">``Do you know I almost feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is like a
father to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) lover's shoulder.

<p/>Paul thought it over for a few minutes, and then said that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would
himself write to Roger. <div class="bookquote">``Hetta, do you know, I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will
ever speak to me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot believe that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a sternness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) which it is very hard to understand.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has taught himself to think that as I met you in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) house, and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) then wished you to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife, I should not have ventured to love
you. How could I have known?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be unreasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is unreasonable--about that. It is not reason with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) always
goes by his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) feelings. Had you been engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, then, you never could have spoken to me like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will never look at it in that way;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will tell me that
I have been untrue to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) and ungrateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you think, Paul--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay; listen to me. If it be so I must bear it. It will be a great
sorrow, but it will be as nothing to that other sorrow, had that come
upon me. I will write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) answer will be all scorn and
wrath. Then you must write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) afterwards. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will forgive
you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will never forgive me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then they parted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) having
promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother directly Lady Carbury came
home, and Paul undertaking to write to Roger that evening.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did, with infinite difficulty, and much trembling of the
spirit. Here is his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) letter:--


<p/>MY DEAR ROGER,--

<p/>I think it right to tell you at once what has occurred
to-day. I have proposed to Miss Carbury and she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) has
accepted me. You have long known what my feelings were,
and I have also known yours. I have known, too, that Miss
Carbury has more than once declined to take your offer.
Under these circumstances I cannot think that I have been
untrue to friendship in what I have done, or that I have
proved myself ungrateful for the affectionate kindness
which you have always shown me. I am authorised by Hetta
to say that, had I never spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>), it must have been
the same to you.

<p/>This was hardly a fair representation of what had been said, but the
writer, looking back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) interview with the lady, thought that
it had been implied.

<p/>I should not say so much by way of excusing myself, but
that you once said, that should such a thing occur there
must be a division between us ever after. If I thought
that you would adhere to that threat, I should be very
unhappy and Hetta would be miserable. Surely, if a man
loves he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is bound to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love, and to take the
chance. You would hardly have thought it manly in me if I
had abstained. Dear friend, take a day or two before you
answer this, and do not banish us from your heart if you
can help it.

<p/>Your affectionate friend,

<p/>PAUL MONTAGUE.


<p/>Roger Carbury did not take a single day,--or a single hour to answer
the letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) received it at breakfast, and after rushing out on the
terrace and walking there for a few minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hurried to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) desk
and wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) reply. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did so, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) whole face was red with wrath,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes were glowing with indignation.


<p/>There is an old French saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) who makes excuses
is his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own accuser. You would not have written as you
have done, had you not felt yourself to be false and
ungrateful. You knew where my heart was, and there you
went and undermined my treasure, and stole it away. You
have destroyed my life, and I will never forgive you.

<p/>You tell me not to banish you both from my heart. How dare
you join yourself with her (<font color='blue'><b>accuser</b></font>) in speaking of my feelings! She (<font color='blue'><b>accuser</b></font>)
will never be banished from my heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>accuser</b></font>) will be there
morning, noon, and night, and as is and will be my love to
her (<font color='blue'><b>accuser</b></font>), so shall be my enmity to you.

<p/>ROGER CARBURY.


<p/>It was hardly a letter for a Christian to write; and, yet, in those
parts Roger Carbury had the reputation of being a good Christian.

<p/>Henrietta told her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother that morning, immediately on her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) return.
<div class="bookquote">``Mamma, Mr. Paul Montague has been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) always comes here when I am away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That has been an accident. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could not have known that you were
going to Messrs. Leadham and Loiter's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not so sure of that, Hetta.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, mamma, you must have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) yourself, and I don't think

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without even asking me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, you knew. I will not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) without asking you. How was I
not to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) asked me whether I--loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>)! How is it possible you should marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>)? Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) had
got was in that affair of Melmotte's, and that has gone to the dogs.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is a ruined man, and for aught I know may be compromised in all
Melmotte's wickedness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, do not say that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do say it. It is hard upon me. I did think that you would try
to comfort me after all this trouble with Felix. But you are as bad
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is;--or worse, for you have not been thrown into temptation
like that poor boy! And you will break your cousin's heart. Poor
Roger! I feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>);--he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that has been so true to us! But you think
nothing of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think very much of my cousin Roger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you show it;--or your love for me? There would have been
a home for us all. Now we must starve, I suppose. Hetta, you have
been worse to me even than Felix.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Then Lady Carbury, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) passion,
burst out of the room, and took herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own chamber.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVII.

<p/>SIR FELIX PROTECTS HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) SISTER.


<p/>Up to this period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) life Sir Felix Carbury had probably felt but
little of the punishment due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) very numerous shortcomings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
had spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) fortune; he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) commission in the army;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had incurred the contempt of everybody that had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had
forfeited the friendship of those who were his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) natural friends, and
had attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) none others in their place; he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had pretty nearly
ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mother and sister; but, to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own language, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had
always contrived <div class="bookquote">``to carry on the game.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had eaten and drunk, had
gambled, hunted, and diverted himself generally after the fashion
considered to be appropriate to young men about town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had kept
up till now. But now there seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) to have come an end to all
things. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was lying in bed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mother's house he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) counted up
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) wealth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had a few pounds in ready money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) still had a
little roll of Mr. Miles Grendall's notes of hand, amounting perhaps
to a couple of hundred pounds,--and Mr. Melmotte owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) #600. But
where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to turn, and what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to do with himself? Gradually
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) learned the whole story of the journey to Liverpool,--how Marie
had gone there and had been sent back by the police, how Marie's
money had been repaid to Mr. Melmotte by Mr. Broune, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
failure to make the journey to Liverpool had become known. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
ashamed to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) club. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could not go to Melmotte's house.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was ashamed even to show himself in the streets by day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
becoming almost afraid even of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mother. Now that the brilliant
marriage had broken down, and seemed to be altogether beyond hope,
now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had to depend on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) household for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) comforts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
was no longer able to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with absolute scorn,--nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
willing to yield as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had yielded.

<p/>One thing only was clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must realise his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) possessions.
With this view he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wrote both to Miles Grendall and to Melmotte. To
the former he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was going out of town,--probably for some time,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must really ask for a cheque for the amount due. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went on
to remark that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could hardly suppose that a nephew of the Duke of
Albury was unable to pay debts of honour to the amount of #200;--but
that if such was the case he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have no alternative but to apply
to the Duke himself. The reader need hardly be told that to this
letter Mr. Grendall vouchsafed no answer whatever. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) letter to
Mr. Melmotte he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) confined himself to one matter of business in hand.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) made no allusion whatever to Marie, or to the great man's anger,
or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) seat at the board. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) simply reminded Mr. Melmotte that
there was a sum of #600 still due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and requested that a cheque
might be sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) for that amount. Melmotte's answer to this was
not altogether unsatisfactory, though it was not exactly what Sir
Felix had wished. A clerk from Mr. Melmotte's office called at the
house in Welbeck Street, and handed to Felix railway scrip in the
South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway to the amount of the sum
claimed,--insisting on a full receipt for the money before he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) parted
with the scrip. The clerk went on to explain, on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
employer, that the money had been left in Mr. Melmotte's hands for
the purpose of buying these shares. Sir Felix, who was glad to get
anything, signed the receipt and took the scrip. This took place on
the day after the balloting at Westminster, when the result was not
yet known,--and when the shares in the railway were very low indeed.
Sir Felix had asked as to the value of the shares at the time.
The clerk professed himself unable to quote the price,--but there
were the shares if Sir Felix liked to take them. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) took
them;--and hurrying off into the City found that they might perhaps
be worth about half the money due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). The broker to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
showed them could not quite answer for anything. Yes;--the scrip
had been very high; but there was a panic. They might recover,--or,
more probably, they might go to nothing. Sir Felix cursed the Great
Financier aloud, and left the scrip for sale. That was the first
time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had been out of the house before dark since his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) little
accident.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was chiefly tormented in these days by the want of amusement.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had so spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) life hitherto that he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did not know how to get
through a day in which no excitement was provided for him (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) never
read. Thinking was altogether beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had never done a
day's work in his (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could lie in bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could eat and drink.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could smoke and sit idle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could play cards; and could amuse
himself with women,--the lower the culture of the women, the better
the amusement. Beyond these things the world had nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).
Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) again took himself to the pursuit of Ruby Ruggles.

<p/>Poor Ruby had endured a very painful incarceration at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) aunt's
house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had been wrathful and had stormed, swearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would
be free to come and go as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) pleased. Free to go, Mrs. Pipkin told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was;--but not free to return if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) went out otherwise
than as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>), Mrs. Pipkin, chose. <div class="bookquote">``Am I to be a slave?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>Ruby asked,
and almost upset the perambulator which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had just dragged in at
the hall door. Then Mrs. Hurtle had taken upon herself to talk to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), and poor Ruby had been quelled by the superior strength of the
American lady. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was very unhappy, finding that it did not suit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) to be nursemaid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) aunt. After all John Crumb couldn't have
cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) a bit, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would have come to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>). While
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was in this condition Sir Felix came to Mrs. Pipkin's house, and
asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) at the door. It happened that Mrs. Pipkin herself had
opened the door,--and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) fright and dismay at the presence of so
pernicious a young man in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) own passage, had denied that Ruby was
in the house. But Ruby had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover's voice, and had rushed up
and thrown herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arms. Then there had been a great scene.
Ruby had sworn that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) didn't care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) aunt, didn't care for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) grandfather, or for Mrs. Hurtle, or for John Crumb,--or for any
person or anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) cared only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) lover. Then Mrs. Hurtle
had asked the young man his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intentions. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mean to marry Ruby?
Sir Felix had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) might as well some day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby, <div class="bookquote">``there!'' (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>--shouting in triumph as though an offer
had been made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) with the completest ceremony of which such an
event admits. Mrs. Pipkin had been very weak. Instead of calling
in the assistance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) strong-minded lodger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had allowed the
lovers to remain together for half-an-hour in the dining-room. I do
not know that Sir Felix in any way repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) promise during that
time, but Ruby was probably too blessed with the word that had been
spoken to ask for such renewal. <div class="bookquote">``There must be an end of this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Pipkin, coming in when the half-hour was over. Then Sir Felix
had gone, promising to come again on the following evening. <div class="bookquote">``You
must not come here, Sir Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin, <div class="bookquote">``unless you puts
it in writing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>To this, of course, Sir Felix made no answer. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
went home he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) congratulated himself on the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adventure.
Perhaps the best thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had realised the money for
the shares would be to take Ruby for a tour abroad. The money would
last for three or four months,--and three or four months ahead was
almost an eternity.

<p/>That afternoon before dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister alone in the
drawing-room. Lady Carbury had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own room after hearing
the distressing story of Paul Montague's love, and had not seen
Hetta since. Hetta was melancholy, thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) mother's hard
words,--thinking perhaps of Paul's poverty as declared by her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother,
and of the ages which might have to wear themselves out before she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
could become his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife; but still tinting all her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thoughts with a rosy
hue because of the love which had been declared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not
but be happy if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--would be true to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through everything! In her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
present mood she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could not speak of herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brother, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
took the opportunity of making good the promise which Marie Melmotte
had extracted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) some short account of the party,
and told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had talked with Marie. <div class="bookquote">``I promised to give you
a message,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all of no use now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must tell you what she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said. I think, you know, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
really loves you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's the good of it? A man can't marry a girl when all the
policemen in the country are dodging her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wants you to let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) know what,--what you intend to do. If you
mean to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up, I think you should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? I don't suppose they would let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) receive a
letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I write to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>);--or shall I see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you like. I don't care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Felix, you are very heartless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose I'm much worse than other men;--or for the matter of
that, worse than a great many women either. You all of you here put
me up to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never put you up to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother did. And now because it did not go off all serene, I am to
hear nothing but reproaches. Of course I never cared so very much
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Felix, that is so shocking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Awfully shocking I dare say. You think I am as black as the very
mischief, and that sugar wouldn't melt in other men's mouths. Other
men are just as bad as I am,--and a good deal worse too. You believe
that there is nobody on earth like Paul Montague.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta blushed, but
said nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was not yet in a condition to boast of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) lover
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) brother, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did, in very truth, believe that but few
young men were as true-hearted as Paul Montague. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you'd be
surprised to hear that Master Paul is engaged to marry an American
widow living at Islington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Montague--engaged--to marry--an American widow! I don't believe
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better believe it if it's any concern of yours, for it's true.
And it's true too that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) travelled about with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) for ever so long
in the United States, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) at the hotel
at Lowestoft about a fortnight ago. There's no mistake about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>repeated Hetta, feeling that to say even as
much as that was some relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). It could not be true. It was
impossible that the man should have come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) with such a lie in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth as that. Though the words astounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) felt
faint, almost as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would fall in a swoon, yet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) heart
of hearts she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did not believe it. Surely it was some horrid joke,--or
perhaps some trick to divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) from the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) loved. <div class="bookquote">``Felix, how
dare you say things so wicked as that to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there wicked in it? If you have been fool enough to become
fond of the man, it is only right you should be told. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is engaged
to marry Mrs. Hurtle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is lodging with one Mrs. Pipkin in
Islington. I know the house, and could take you there to-morrow, and
show you the woman. There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that's where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is;'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wrote Mrs. Hurtle's name down on a scrap of paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) seat, and standing
upright. <div class="bookquote">``I am engaged to Mr. Montague, and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would not
treat me in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, by heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) shall answer it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix, jumping up.
<div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has done that, it is time that I should interfere. As true as
I stand here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) is engaged to marry a woman called Mrs. Hurtle whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) constantly visits at that place in Islington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, repeating the only defence for her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
lover which was applicable at the moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George, this is beyond a joke. Will you believe it if Roger
Carbury says it's true? I know you'd believe anything fast enough
against me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) told you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger Carbury will not say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you the courage to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)? I say he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) will say so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knows all
about it,--and has seen the woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you know? Has Roger told you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do know, and that's enough. I will make this square with Master
Paul. By heaven, yes! He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) shall answer to me. But my mother must
manage you. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will not scruple to ask Roger, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will believe
what Roger tells her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe a word of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, leaving the room.
But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was very wretched. There must be some
foundation for such a tale. Why should Felix have referred to Roger
Carbury? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did feel that there was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) brother's
manner which forbade her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to reject the whole story as being
altogether baseless. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) sat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) bed and cried, and thought
of all the tales she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had heard of faithless lovers. And yet why
should the man have come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), not only with soft words of love,
but asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) hand in marriage, if it really were true that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
in daily communication with another woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had promised to
make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife?

<p/>Nothing on the subject was said at dinner. Hetta with difficulty to
herself sat at the table, and did not speak. Lady Carbury and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son
were nearly as silent. Soon after dinner Felix slunk away to some
music hall or theatre in quest probably of some other Ruby Ruggles.
Then Lady Carbury, who had now been told as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son knew,
again attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter. Very much of the story Felix had learned
from Ruby. Ruby had of course learned that Paul was engaged to Mrs.
Hurtle. Mrs. Hurtle had at once declared the fact to Mrs. Pipkin, and
Mrs. Pipkin had been proud of the position of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) lodger. Ruby had
herself seen Paul Montague at the house, and had known that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had
taken Mrs. Hurtle to Lowestoft. And it had also become known to the
two women, the aunt and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) niece, that Mrs. Hurtle had seen Roger
Carbury on the sands at Lowestoft. Thus the whole story with most of
its details,--not quite with all,--had come round to Lady Carbury's
ears. <div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has told you, my dear, is true. Much as I disapprove
of Mr. Montague, you do not suppose that I would deceive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) know, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) does know. I cannot explain to you how. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has been at the same
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has, but Roger Carbury has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). If I
write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) you will believe what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) says?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do that, mamma. Don't write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall. Why should I not write if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) can tell me? If this other
man is a villain am I not bound to protect you? Of course Felix is
not steady. If it came only from him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) you might not credit it. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) has not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). If your cousin Roger tells you that it is
true,--tells me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knows the man is engaged to marry this woman,
then I suppose you will be contented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Contented, mamma!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Satisfied that what we tell you is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never be contented again. If that is true, I will never
believe anything. It can't be true. I suppose there is something, but
it can't be that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>The story was not altogether displeasing to Lady Carbury, though it
pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to see the agony which her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter suffered. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
no wish that Paul Montague should be her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) son-in-law, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) still
thought that if Roger would persevere he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might succeed. On that very
night before she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) went to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wrote to Roger, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) the
whole story. <div class="bookquote">``If,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you know that there is such a person as
Mrs. Hurtle, and if you know also that Mr. Montague has promised to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wife, of course you will tell me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
own wishes, thinking that by doing so she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could induce Roger Carbury
to give such real assistance in this matter that Paul Montague
would certainly be driven away. Who could feel so much interest
in doing this as Roger, or who be so closely acquainted with all
the circumstances of Montague's life? <div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what
my wishes are about Hetta, and how utterly opposed I am to Mr.
Montague's interference. If it is true, as Felix says, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) is
at the present moment entangled with another woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) is guilty of
gross insolence; and if you know all the circumstances you can surely
protect us,--and also yourself.''




 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXVIII.

<p/>MISS MELMOTTE DECLARES HER PURPOSE.


<p/>Poor Hetta passed a very bad night. The story she (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>) had heard seemed to
be almost too awful to be true,--even about any one else. The man had
come to her (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>), and had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>MELMOTTE</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife,--and yet at that very
moment was living in habits of daily intercourse with another woman
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had promised to marry! And then, too, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) courtship with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had been so graceful, so soft, so modest, and yet so long continued!
Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been slow in speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had known since their first
meeting how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! The whole state of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind had, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
thought, been visible to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--had been intelligible, gentle, and
affectionate. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends' feeling, and had
therefore hesitated. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had kept himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had owed
so much to friendship. And yet his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love had not been the less true,
and had not been less dear to poor Hetta. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had waited, sure that
it would come,--having absolute confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honour and love.
And now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was told that this man had been playing a game so base,
and at the same time so foolish, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could find not only no
excuse but no possible cause for it. It was not like any story she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had heard before of man's faithlessness. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was wretched and
sore at heart she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) swore to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not believe it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother would write to Roger Carbury,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew
also that nothing more would be said about the letter till the answer
should come. Nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turn anywhere else for comfort. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did
not dare to appeal to Paul himself. As regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), for the present
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could only rely on the assurance, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) continued to give
herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would not believe a word of the story that had been
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/>But there was other wretchedness besides her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had undertaken
to give Marie Melmotte's message to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had done so, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must now let Marie have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) brother's reply. That might be told
in a very few words--<div class="bookquote">``Everything is over!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But it had to be told.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to call upon Miss Melmotte, if you'll let me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mother at breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you want to see Miss Melmotte? I thought you hated the
Melmottes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't hate them, mamma. I certainly don't hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). I have a
message to take to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--from Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A message--from Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an answer from him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) wanted to know if all that was over.
Of course it is over. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said so or not, it would be so. They
could never be married now;--could they, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>The marriage, in Lady Carbury's mind, was no longer even desirable.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), too, was beginning to disbelieve in the Melmotte wealth, and did
quite disbelieve that that wealth would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son, even should
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) succeed in marrying the daughter. It was impossible that Melmotte
should forgive such offence as had now been committed. <div class="bookquote">``It is out of
the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That, like everything else with us, has
been a wretched failure. You can go, if you please. Felix is under no
obligation to them, and has taken nothing from them. I should much
doubt whether the girl will get anybody to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now. You can't go
alone, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury added. But Hetta said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not
at all object to going alone as far as that. It was only just over
Oxford Street.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) went out and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) way into Grosvenor Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
heard, but at the time remembered nothing, of the temporary migration
of the Melmottes to Bruton Street. Seeing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) approached the
house, that there was a confusion there of carts and workmen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
hesitated. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) went on, and rang the bell at the door, which was
wide open. Within the hall the pilasters and trophies, the wreaths
and the banners, which three or four days since had been built up
with so much trouble, were now being pulled down and hauled away. And
amidst the ruins Melmotte himself was standing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was now a member
of Parliament, and was to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) place that night in the House.
Nothing, at any rate, should prevent that. It might be but for a
short time;--but it should be written in the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) life that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had sat in the British House of Commons as member for Westminster.
At the present moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was careful to show himself everywhere.
It was now noon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had already been into the City. At this
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was talking to the contractor for the work,--having just
propitiated that man by a payment which would hardly have been made
so soon but for the necessity which these wretched stories had
entailed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of keeping up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) credit for the possession of
money. Hetta timidly asked one of the workmen whether Miss Melmotte
was there. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want my daughter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte coming forward,
and just touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is not living here at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,--I remember now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I be allowed to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) who was asking after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>At the
present moment Melmotte was not unreasonably suspicious about his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Miss Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta in a very low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed;--Miss Carbury!--the sister of Sir Felix Carbury?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>There
was something in the tone of the man's voice which grated painfully
on Hetta's ears,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) answered the question. <div class="bookquote">``Oh;--Sir Felix's
sister! May I be permitted to ask whether--you have any business with
my daughter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the workmen</b></font>)</div>The story was a hard one to tell, with all the workmen
around her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), in the midst of the lumber, with the coarse face of
the suspicious man looking down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) did tell it very
simply. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had come with a message from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brother. There had been
something between her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brother and Miss Melmotte, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brother had
felt that it would be best that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should acknowledge that it must
be all over. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether that is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) great coarse eyes, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eyebrows knit, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pockets. Hetta, not knowing
how, at the moment, to repudiate the suspicion expressed, was
silent. <div class="bookquote">``Because, you know, there has been a deal of falsehood and
double dealing. Sir Felix has behaved infamously; yes,--by G--,
infamously. A day or two before my daughter started, he (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) gave me a
written assurance that the whole thing was over, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sends you
here. How am I to know what you are really after?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come because I thought I could do some good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said,
trembling with anger and fear. <div class="bookquote">``I was speaking to your daughter at
your party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you were there;--were you? It may be as you say, but how is
one to tell? When one has been deceived like that, one is apt to be
suspicious, Miss Carbury.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>Here was one who had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) life in
lying to the world, and who was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) very heart shocked at the
atrocity of a man who had lied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)! <div class="bookquote">``You are not plotting another
journey to Liverpool;--are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>To this Hetta could make no answer.
The insult was too much, but alone, unsupported, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not know how
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) back scorn for scorn. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) proposed to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
across to Bruton Street himself, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bidding she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) walked by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
side. <div class="bookquote">``May I hear what you say to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you suspect me, Mr. Melmotte, I had better not see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) at all. It
is only that there may no longer be any doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can say it all before me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I could not do that. But I have told you, and you can say it
for me. If you please, I think I will go home now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>But Melmotte knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) daughter would not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) on such a
subject. This girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) probably would believe. And though Melmotte
himself found it difficult to trust anybody, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that there
was more possible good than evil to be expected from the proposed
interview. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s
such a fool as to try that kind of thing again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Then the door in
Bruton Street was opened, and Hetta, repenting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mission, found
herself almost pushed into the hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bidden to follow
Melmotte up-stairs, and was left alone in the drawing-room, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
thought, for a long time. Then the door was slowly opened and Marie
crept into the room. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``this is so good of
you,--so good of you! I do so love you for coming to me! You said you
would love me. You will; will you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and Marie, sitting down by
the stranger, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hand and encircled her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) waist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Melmotte has told you why I have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--that is, I don't know. I never believe what papa says to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>To poor Hetta such an announcement as this was horrible. <div class="bookquote">``We are at
daggers drawn. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) thinks I ought to do just what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) tells me, as
though my very soul were not my own. I won't agree to that;--would
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta had not come there to preach disobedience, but could not
fail to remember at the moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was not disposed to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
mother in an affair of the same kind. <div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) say, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta's message was to be conveyed in three words, and when those
were told, there was nothing more to be said. <div class="bookquote">``It must all be over,
Miss Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) message, Miss Carbury?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Is that
all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What more can I say? The other night you told me to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) send you
word. And I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) ought to do so. I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) your message, and I
have brought back the answer. My brother, you know, has no income of
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own;--nothing at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie with eagerness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But your father--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not depend upon papa. If papa treats me badly, I can give it
to my husband. I know I can. If I can venture, cannot he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think
it is impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible! Nothing should be impossible. All the people that one
hears of that are really true to their loves never find anything
impossible. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love me, Miss Carbury? It all depends on that.
That's what I want to know.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) paused, but Hetta could not answer
the question. <div class="bookquote">``You must know about your brother. Don't you know
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does love me? If you know I think you ought to tell me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta was still silent. <div class="bookquote">``Have you nothing to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Melmotte--''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>began poor Hetta very slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call me Marie. You said you would love me;--did you not? I don't
even know what your name is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is--Hetta.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hetta;--that's short for something. But it's very pretty. I have
no brother, no sister. And I'll tell you, though you must not tell
anybody again;--I have no real mother. Madame Melmotte is not my
mamma, though papa chooses that it should be thought so.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>All this
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) whispered, with rapid words, almost into Hetta's ear. <div class="bookquote">``And papa
is so cruel to me! He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) beats me sometimes.''  (<font color='red'><b>The friend round</b></font>)</div>The new friend, round
whom Marie still had her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) arm, shuddered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) heard this. <div class="bookquote">``But I
never will yield a bit for that. When he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) boxes and thumps me I always
turn and gnash my teeth at him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). Can you wonder that I want to have a
friend? Can you be surprised that I should be always thinking of my
lover? But,--if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) doesn't love me, what am I to do then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I am to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Hetta amidst her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) sobs.
Whether the girl was good or bad, to be sought or to be avoided,
there was so much tragedy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) position that Hetta's heart was
melted with sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether you love anybody, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) loves you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said
Marie. Hetta certainly had not come there to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own affairs,
and made no reply to this. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you won't tell me about
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could tell you something for your own comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) will not try again, you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fears. I should fear nothing,--nothing. Why should
not we walk out of the house, and be married any way? Nobody has a
right to stop me. Papa could only turn me out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) house. I will
venture if he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to Hetta that even listening to such a proposition amounted
to falsehood,--to that guilt of which Mr. Melmotte had dared to
suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could be capable. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot listen to it. Indeed I
cannot listen to it. My brother is sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cannot--cannot--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cannot love me, Hetta! Say it out, if it is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta. There came over the face of the other girl
a stern hard look, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had resolved at the moment to throw
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) all soft womanly things. And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) relaxed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hold on
Hetta's waist. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, I do not mean to be cruel, but you ask
me for the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Men are not, I think, like girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie slowly. <div class="bookquote">``What liars they are, what
brutes;--what wretches! Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) tell me lies like that? Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) break my heart? That other man never said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved me.
Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never love me,--once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta could hardly say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) brother was incapable of such love as
Marie expected, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) knew that it was so. <div class="bookquote">``It is better that you
should think of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you like that? If you had loved a man and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of it, and
agreed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and done as I have, could you bear to be told
to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no more,--just as though you had got rid of a servant
or a horse? I won't love him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). No;--I'll hate him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). But I must think of
him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). I'll marry that other man to spite him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds
that we are rich, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be broken-hearted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should try to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Marie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never. Do not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I command you not to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that if I ever
meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I will look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall never forget it. I
could,--oh!--you do not know what I could do. Tell me;--did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tell
you to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had not come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you have come. It was very kind. I don't hate you. Of
course I ought to know. But did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say that I was to be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
did not love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then how do you know? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That it was all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is afraid of papa. Are you sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a brute. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a false-hearted
liar, and that I trample him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) under my foot.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said this
thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) foot upon the ground as though that false one were in

hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I despise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);--despise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). They are all bad, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
the worst of all. Papa beats me, but I can bear that. Mamma reviles
me and I can bear that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) might have beaten me and reviled me,
and I could have borne it. But to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) was a liar all the
time;--that I can't bear.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) burst into tears. Hetta kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), tried to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) sobbing on the sofa.

<p/>Later in the day, two or three hours after Miss Carbury had gone,
Marie Melmotte, who had not shown herself at luncheon, walked into
Madame Melmotte's room, and thus declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) purpose. <div class="bookquote">``You can tell
papa that I will marry Lord Nidderdale whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) pleases.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
spoke in French and very rapidly.

<p/>On hearing this Madame Melmotte expressed herself to be delighted.
<div class="bookquote">``Your papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``will be very glad to hear that you have
thought better of this at last. Lord Nidderdale is, I am sure, a very
good young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>continued Marie, boiling over with passion as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
marry Lord Nidderdale, or that horrid Mr. Grendall who is worse than
all the others, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) old fool of a father,--or the sweeper at the
crossing,--or the black man that waits at table, or anybody else that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chooses to pick up. I don't care who it is the least in the world.
But I'll lead him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) such a life afterwards! I'll make Lord Nidderdale
repent the hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) saw me! You may tell papa.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>And then, having thus
entrusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) message to Madame Melmotte, Marie left the room.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIX.

<p/>MELMOTTE IN PARLIAMENT.


<p/>Melmotte did not return home in time to hear the good news that
day,--good news as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would regard it, even though, when told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
it should be accompanied by all the extraneous additions with which
Marie had communicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) purpose to Madame Melmotte. It was nothing
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) what the girl thought of the marriage,--if the marriage could
now be brought about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), too, had cause for vexation, if not for
anger. If Marie had consented a fortnight since he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might have so
hurried affairs that Lord Nidderdale might by this time have been
secured. Now there might be,--must be, doubt, through the folly
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) girl and the villany of Sir Felix Carbury. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) once
the father-in-law of the eldest son of a marquis, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
might almost be safe. Even though something might be all but proved
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>),--which might come to certain proof in less august
circumstances,--matters would hardly be pressed against a Member for
Westminster whose daughter was married to the heir of the Marquis of
Auld Reekie! So many persons would then be concerned! Of course his (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>)
vexation with Marie had been great. Of course his (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) wrath against Sir
Felix was unbounded. The seat for Westminster was his (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) was to be
seen to occupy it before all the world on this very day. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) had
not as yet heard that his (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) daughter had yielded in reference to Lord
Nidderdale.

<p/>There was considerable uneasiness felt in some circles as to the
manner in which Melmotte should take his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) seat. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was put
forward as the Conservative candidate for the borough a good deal of
fuss had been made with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) by certain leading politicians. It had
been the manifest intention of the party that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) return, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were
returned, should be hailed as a great Conservative triumph, and be
made much of through the length and the breadth of the land. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
returned,--but the trumpets had not as yet been sounded loudly. On a
sudden, within the space of forty-eight hours, the party had become
ashamed of their man. And, now, who was to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the
House? But with this feeling of shame on one side, there was already
springing up an idea among another class that Melmotte might become
as it were a Conservative tribune of the people,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might be
the realization of that hitherto hazy mixture of Radicalism and
old-fogyism, of which we have lately heard from a political master,
whose eloquence has been employed in teaching us that progress can
only be expected from those whose declared purpose is to stand still.
The new farthing newspaper, <div class="bookquote">``The Mob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>was already putting Melmotte
forward as a political hero, preaching with reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
commercial transactions the grand doctrine that magnitude in affairs
is a valid defence for certain irregularities. A Napoleon, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>)
may exterminate tribes in carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) projects, cannot be judged
by the same law as a young lieutenant who may be punished for cruelty
to a few negroes. <div class="bookquote">``The Mob''  (<font color='red'><b>a multitude</b></font>)</div>thought that a good deal should be
overlooked in a Melmotte, and that the philanthropy of his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) great
designs should be allowed to cover a multitude of sins. I do not know
that the theory was ever so plainly put forward as it was done by the
ingenious and courageous writer in <div class="bookquote">``The Mob;''  (<font color='red'><b>the writer</b></font>)</div>but in practice it has
commanded the assent of many intelligent minds.

<p/>Mr. Melmotte, therefore, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not where he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been before
that wretched Squercum had set afloat the rumours as to the purchase
of Pickering, was able to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) head much higher than on the
unfortunate night of the great banquet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) had replied to the letter
from Messrs. Slow and Bideawhile, by a note written in the ordinary
way in the office, and only signed by himself. In this he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) merely said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) would lose no time in settling matters as to the purchase of
Pickering. Slow and Bideawhile were of course anxious that things
should be settled. They wanted no prosecution for forgery. To make
themselves clear in the matter, and their client,--and if possible
to take some wind out of the sails of the odious Squercum;--this
would suit them best. They were prone to hope that for his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) own sake
Melmotte would raise the money. If it were raised there would be
no reason why that note purporting to have been signed by Dolly
Longestaffe should ever leave their office. They still protested
their belief that it did bear Dolly's signature. They had various
excuses for themselves. It would have been useless for them to
summon Dolly to their office, as they knew from long experience that
Dolly would not come. The very letter written by themselves,--as a
suggestion,--and given to Dolly's father, had come back to them with
Dolly's ordinary signature, sent to them,--as they believed,--with
other papers by Dolly's father. What justification could be clearer?
But still the money had not been paid. That was the fault of
Longestaffe senior. But if the money could be paid, that would set
everything right. Squercum evidently thought that the money would
not be paid, and was ceaseless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) intercourse with Bideawhile's
people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) charged Slow and Bideawhile with having delivered up the
title-deeds on the authority of a mere note, and that a note with
a forged signature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) demanded that the note should be impounded.
On the receipt by Mr. Bideawhile of Melmotte's rather curt reply Mr.
Squercum was informed that Mr. Melmotte had promised to pay the money
at once, but that a day or two must be allowed. Mr. Squercum replied
that on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) client's behalf he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) should open the matter before the Lord
Mayor.

<p/>But in this way two or three days had passed without any renewal
of the accusation before the public, and Melmotte had in a certain
degree recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) position. The Beauclerks and the Luptons
disliked and feared him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as much as ever, but they did not quite dare
to be so loud and confident in condemnation as they had been. It
was pretty well known that Mr. Longestaffe had not received his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
money,--and that was a condition of things tending greatly to shake
the credit of a man living after Melmotte's fashion. But there was
no crime in that. No forgery was implied by the publication of any
statement to that effect. The Longestaffes, father and son, might
probably have been very foolish. Whoever expected anything but folly
from either? And Slow and Bideawhile might have been very remiss
in their duty. It was astonishing, some people said, what things
attorneys would do in these days! But they who had expected to see
Melmotte behind the bars of a prison before this, and had regulated
their conduct accordingly, now imagined that they had been deceived.

<p/>Had the Westminster triumph been altogether a triumph it would have
become the pleasant duty of some popular Conservative to express to
Melmotte the pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have in introducing his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) new political
ally to the House. In such case Melmotte himself would have been
walked up the chamber with a pleasurable ovation and the thing would
have been done without trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). But now this was not the
position of affairs. Though the matter was debated at the Carlton,
no such popular Conservative offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Conservative</b></font>) services. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think we
ought to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beauclerk/Beauchamp Beauclerk/Mr. Beauchamp Beauclerk</b></font>)</div>Mr. Beauclerk said. Sir Orlando Drought,
quite a leading Conservative, suggested that as Lord Nidderdale was
very intimate with Mr. Melmotte he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might do it. But Nidderdale was
not the man for such a performance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was a very good fellow and
everybody liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) belonged to the House because his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father had
territorial influence in a Scotch county;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) never did anything
there, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) selection for such a duty would be a declaration
to the world that nobody else would do it. <div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't hurt you,
Lupton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beauclerk/Beauchamp Beauclerk/Mr. Beauchamp Beauclerk</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Beauclerk. <div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupton/Lionel Lupton</b></font>)</div>said Lupton; <div class="bookquote">``but I also,
like Nidderdale, am a young man and of no use,--and a great deal too
bashful.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupton/Lionel Lupton</b></font>)</div>Melmotte, who knew but little about it, went down to the
House at four o'clock, somewhat cowed by want of companionship, but
carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) resolution that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be stopped by no phantom
fears,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would lose nothing by want of personal pluck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a Member, and concluded that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) presented himself
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be able to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) way in and assume his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) right. But here
again fortune befriended him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). The very leader of the party, the very
founder of that new doctrine of which it was thought that Melmotte
might become an apostle and an expounder,--who, as the reader may
remember, had undertaken to be present at the banquet when his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
colleagues were dismayed and untrue to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and who kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) promise
and sat there almost in solitude,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) happened to be entering the
House, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) late host was claiming from the door-keeper the
fruition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) privilege. <div class="bookquote">``You had better let me accompany you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>said the Conservative leader, with something of chivalry in his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>)
heart. And so Mr. Melmotte was introduced to the House by the head of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) party! When this was seen many men supposed that the rumours had
been proved to be altogether false. Was not this a guarantee
sufficient to guarantee any man's respectability?

<p/>Lord Nidderdale saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father in the lobby of the House of Lords
that afternoon and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) what had occurred. The old man had been
in a state of great doubt since the day of the dinner party. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was aware of the ruin that would be incurred by a marriage with
Melmotte's daughter, if the things which had been said of Melmotte
should be proved to be true. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew also that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) son should
now recede, there must be an end of the match altogether;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
did not believe the rumours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was fully determined that the money
should be paid down before the marriage was celebrated; but if his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
son were to secede now, of course no money would be forthcoming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
was prepared to recommend his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) son to go on with the affair still a
little longer. <div class="bookquote">``Old Cure tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) doesn't believe a word of it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father. Cure was the family lawyer of the Marquises of Auld
Reekie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some hitch about Dolly Longestaffe's money, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the
son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that to us if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) has our money ready? I suppose it isn't
always easy even for a man like that to get a couple of hundred
thousand together. I know I've never found it easy to get a thousand.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has borrowed a trifle from Longestaffe to make up the girl's
money, I shan't complain. You stand to your guns. There's no harm
done till the parson has said the word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't let me have a couple of hundred;--could you, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>suggested the son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>replied the father with a very determined aspect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm awfully hard up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Then the old man toddled into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own chamber, and after
sitting there ten minutes went away home.

<p/>Lord Nidderdale also got quickly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) legislative duties and
went to the Beargarden. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) found Grasslough and Miles Grendall
dining together, and seated himself at the next table. They were full
of news. <div class="bookquote">``You've heard it, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles in an awful
whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heard what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) doesn't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Lord Grasslough. <div class="bookquote">``By Jove,
Nidderdale, you're in a mess like some others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's up now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only fancy that they shouldn't have known down at the House! Vossner
has bolted!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bolted!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Nidderdale, dropping the spoon with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was
just going to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) soup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bolted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>repeated Grasslough. Lord Nidderdale looked round the room
and became aware of the awful expression of dismay which hung upon
the features of all the dining members. <div class="bookquote">``Bolted by George! He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has
sold all our acceptances to a fellow in Great Marlbro' that's called
`Flatfleece.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>said Miles ruefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A bottle of champagne!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale, appealing to the waiter
in almost a humble voice, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) wanted sustenance in this
new trouble that had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). The waiter, beaten almost to the
ground by an awful sense of the condition of the club, whispered
to him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) the terrible announcement that there was not a bottle of
champagne in the house. <div class="bookquote">``Good G--,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nobleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the unfortunate
nobleman. Miles Grendall shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) head. Grasslough shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) head.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Not a bottle of champagne in the house.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>another lord</b></font>)</div>said another young lord from the table on the other
side. Then the waiter, still speaking with suppressed and melancholy
voice, suggested that there was some port left. It was now the middle
of July.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brandy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>suggested Nidderdale. There had been a few bottles of
brandy, but they had been already consumed. <div class="bookquote">``Send out and get some
brandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale with rapid impetuosity. But the club was so
reduced in circumstances that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was obliged to take silver out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) pocket before he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) could get even such humble comfort as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) now
demanded.

<p/>Then Lord Grasslough told the whole story as far as it was known.
Herr Vossner had not been seen since nine o'clock on the preceding
evening. The head waiter had known for some weeks that heavy bills
were due. It was supposed that three or four thousand pounds were
owing to tradesmen, who now professed that the credit had been given,
not to Herr Vossner but to the club. And the numerous acceptances
for large sums which the accommodating purveyor held from many of
the members had all been sold to Mr. Flatfleece. Mr. Flatfleece had
spent a considerable portion of the day at the club, and it was now
suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) and Herr Vossner were in partnership. At this
moment Dolly Longestaffe came in. Dolly had been at the club before
and had heard the story,--but had gone at once to another club for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) dinner when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) found that there was not even a bottle of wine
to be had. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``One thing atop of another!
There'll be nothing left for anybody soon. Is that brandy you're
drinking, Nidderdale? There was none here when I left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had to send round the corner for it, to the public.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be sending round the corner for a good many things now.
Does anybody know anything of that fellow Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s down in the House, as big as life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s all
right I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'d pay me my money then. That fellow Flatfleece was here,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) showed me notes of mine for about #1,500! I write such a
beastly hand that I never know whether I've written it or not. But,
by George, a fellow can't eat and drink #1,500 in less than six
months!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no knowing what you can do, Dolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Lord Grasslough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s paid some of your card money, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale.

<p/>``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ever did. Carbury had a lot of my I. O. U.``s while
that was going on, but I got the money for that from old Melmotte.
How is a fellow to know? If any fellow writes D. Longestaffe, am I
obliged to pay it? Everybody is writing my name! How is any fellow
to stand that kind of thing? Do you think Melmotte's all right?''
Nidderdale said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) did think so. <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wouldn't go and
write my name then. That's a sort of thing that a man should be left
to do for himself. I suppose Vossner is a swindler; but, by Jove,
I know a worse than Vossner.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) heels and
went into the smoking-room. And, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was gone, there was silence
at the table, for it was known that Lord Nidderdale was to marry
Melmotte's daughter.

<p/>In the meantime a scene of a different kind was going on in the House
of Commons. Melmotte had been seated on one of the back Conservative
benches, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) remained for a considerable time unnoticed and
forgotten. The little emotion that had attended his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) entrance had
passed away, and Melmotte was now no more than any one else. At
first he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat off, but, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) observed that the
majority of members were covered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) put it on again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sat
motionless for an hour, looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and wondering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had never
hitherto been even in the gallery of the House. The place was very
much smaller than he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had thought, and much less tremendous. The
Speaker did not strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) with the awe which he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) had expected, and it
seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) that they who spoke were talking much like other people
in other places. For the first hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) hardly caught the meaning of a
sentence that was said, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) try to do so. One man got up very
quickly after another, some of them barely rising on their legs to
say the few words that they uttered. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be a very
common-place affair,--not half so awful as those festive occasions on
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had occasionally been called upon to propose a toast or to
return thanks. Then suddenly the manner of the thing was changed, and
one gentleman made a long speech. Melmotte by this time, weary of
observing, had begun to listen, and words which were familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ears. The gentleman was proposing some little addition
to a commercial treaty and was expounding in very strong language
the ruinous injustice to which England was exposed by being tempted
to use gloves made in a country in which no income tax was levied.
Melmotte listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eloquence caring nothing about gloves,
and very little about England's ruin. But in the course of the
debate which followed, a question arose about the value of money, of
exchange, and of the conversion of shillings into francs and dollars.
About this Melmotte really did know something and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
ears. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that a gentleman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew very well in the
city,--and who had maliciously stayed away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) dinner,--one Mr.
Brown, who sat just before him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) on the same side of the House, and who
was plodding wearily and slowly along with some pet fiscal theory of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own, understood nothing at all of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was saying. Here was an
opportunity for himself! Here was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand the means of revenging
himself for the injury done him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and of showing to the world at the
same time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was not afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) city enemies! It required
some courage certainly,--this attempt that suggested itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) of
getting upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) legs a couple of hours after his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) first introduction
to parliamentary life. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was full of the lesson which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was now
ever teaching himself. Nothing should cow him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Whatever was to be
done by brazen-faced audacity he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would do. It seemed to be very easy,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) saw no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should not put that old fool right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
knew nothing of the forms of the House;--was more ignorant of them
than an ordinary schoolboy;--but on that very account felt less
trepidation than might another parliamentary novice. Mr. Brown was
tedious and prolix; and Melmotte, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
project and had almost told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would do the thing,
was still doubting, when, suddenly, Mr. Brown sat down. There did
not seem to be any particular end to the speech, nor had Melmotte
followed any general thread of argument. But a statement had been
made and repeated, containing, as Melmotte thought, a fundamental
error in finance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) longed to set the matter right. At any rate
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) desired to show the House that Mr. Brown did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
was talking about,--because Mr. Brown had not come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) dinner.
When Mr. Brown was seated, nobody at once rose. The subject was not
popular, and they who understood the business of the House were well
aware that the occasion had simply been one on which two or three
commercial gentlemen, having crazes of their own, should be allowed
to ventilate them. The subject would have dropped;--but on a sudden
the new member was on his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) legs.

<p/>Now it was probably not in the remembrance of any gentleman there
that a member had got up to make a speech within two or three hours
of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) first entry into the House. And this gentleman was one
whose recent election had been of a very peculiar kind. It had
been considered by many of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) supporters that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name should be
withdrawn just before the ballot; by others that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be deterred
by shame from showing himself even if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were elected; and again by
another party that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appearance in Parliament would be prevented by
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) disappearance within the walls of Newgate. But here he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was, not
only in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seat, but on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) legs! The favourable grace, the air of
courteous attention, which is always shown to a new member when he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
first speaks, was extended also to Melmotte. There was an excitement
in the thing which made gentlemen willing to listen, and a consequent
hum, almost of approbation.

<p/>As soon as Melmotte was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) legs, and, looking round, found that
everybody was silent with the intent of listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), a good deal
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) courage oozed out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) fingers' ends. The House, which, to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thinking, had by no means been august while Mr. Brown had been
toddling through his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) speech, now became awful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) caught the eyes of
great men fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>),--of men who had not seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) to be
at all great as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had watched them a few minutes before, yawning
beneath their hats. Mr. Brown, poor as his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) speech had been, had, no
doubt, prepared it,--and had perhaps made three or four such speeches
every year for the last fifteen years. Melmotte had not dreamed of
putting two words together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had thought, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had thought
at all, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could rattle off what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had to say just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might
do it when seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) chair at the Mexican Railway Board. But
there was the Speaker, and those three clerks in their wigs, and the
mace,--and worse than all, the eyes of that long row of statesmen
opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>)! His (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) position was felt by him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) to be dreadful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) had
forgotten even the very point on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) had intended to crush Mr.
Brown.

<p/>But the courage of the man was too high to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) to be altogether
quelled at once. The hum was prolonged; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was red in the
face, perspiring, and utterly confused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was determined to make
a dash at the matter with the first words which would occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brown is all wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had not even taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) hat
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) rose. Mr. Brown turned slowly round and looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>). Some
one, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) could not exactly hear, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) behind, suggested
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) should take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) hat. There was a cry of order, which of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) did not understand. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, nodding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head, and frowning angrily at poor Mr. Brown.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: Melmotte in Parliament.-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``The honourable member,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Speaker</b></font>)</div>said the Speaker, with the most good-natured
voice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) could assume, <div class="bookquote">``is not perhaps as yet aware that
he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) should not call another member by his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) name. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) should speak
of the gentleman to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) alluded as the honourable member
for Whitechapel. And in speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) should address, not another
honourable member, but the chair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should take your hat off,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the good-natured gentleman
behind.

<p/>In such a position how should any man understand so many and such
complicated instructions at once, and at the same time remember the
gist of the argument to be produced? He (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) did take off his (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) hat, and was
of course made hotter and more confused by doing so. <div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) said
was all wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>continued Melmotte; <div class="bookquote">``and I should have thought a man
out of the City, like Mr. Brown, ought to have known better.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Then
there were repeated calls of order, and a violent ebullition of
laughter from both sides of the House. The man stood for a while
glaring around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), summoning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own pluck for a renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
attack on Mr. Brown, determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) would be appalled and put
down neither by the ridicule of those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>), nor by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) want of
familiarity with the place; but still utterly unable to find words
with which to carry on the combat. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to know something about
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte sitting down and hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) indignation and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
shame under his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are sure that the honourable member for Westminster does
understand the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>said the leader of the House, <div class="bookquote">``and we shall
be very glad to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) remarks. The House I am sure will pardon
ignorance of its rules in so young a member.''

 (<font color='red'><b>House/Carbury Manor House/Manor House</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Melmotte would not rise again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had made a great effort,
and had at any rate exhibited his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) courage. Though they might all say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not displayed much eloquence, they would be driven to
admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not been ashamed to show himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) seat
till the regular stampede was made for dinner, and then walked out
with as stately a demeanour as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could assume.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that was plucky!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Cohenlupe, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) friend's arm in
the lobby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see any pluck in it. That old fool Brown didn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
was talking about, and I wanted to tell them so. They wouldn't let me
do it, and there's an end of it. It seems to me to be a stupid sort
of a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Longestaffe's money been paid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Cohenlupe opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) black
eyes while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) friend's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you trouble your head about Longestaffe, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) money
either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, getting into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brougham; <div class="bookquote">``do you leave Mr.
Longestaffe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) money to me. I hope you are not such a fool as
to be scared by what the other fools say. When men play such a game
as you and I are concerned in, they ought to know better than to be
afraid of every word that is spoken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear; yes;''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Cohenlupe apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``You don't suppose
that I am afraid of anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>But at that moment Mr. Cohenlupe was
meditating his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) own escape from the dangerous shores of England, and
was trying to remember what happy country still was left in which an
order from the British police would have no power to interfere with
the comfort of a retired gentleman such as himself.

<p/>That evening Madame Melmotte told her (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) husband that Marie was now
willing to marry Lord Nidderdale;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did not say anything as
to the crossing-sweeper or the black footman, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) allude to
Marie's threat of the sort of life she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) husband.




<p/>CHAPTER LXX.

<p/>SIR FELIX MEDDLES WITH MANY MATTERS.


<p/>There is no duty more certain or fixed in the world than that which
calls upon a brother to defend his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister from ill-usage; but, at the
same time, in the way we live now, no duty is more difficult, and
we may say generally more indistinct. The ill-usage to which men's
sisters are most generally exposed is one which hardly admits of
either protection or vengeance,--although the duty of protecting
and avenging is felt and acknowledged. We are not allowed to fight
duels, and that banging about of another man with a stick is always
disagreeable and seldom successful. A John Crumb can do it, perhaps,
and come out of the affair exulting; but not a Sir Felix Carbury,
even if the Sir Felix of the occasion have the requisite courage.
There is a feeling, too, when a girl has been jilted,--thrown over,
perhaps, is the proper term,--after the gentleman has had the fun of
making love to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for an entire season, and has perhaps even been
allowed privileges as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) promised husband, that the less said the
better. The girl does not mean to break her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart for love of the
false one, and become the tragic heroine of a tale for three months.
It is her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) purpose again to

<p/>--trick her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beams, and with new-spangled ore
Flame in the forehead of the morning sky.

<p/>Though this one has been false, as were perhaps two or three before,
still the road to success is open. Uno avulso non deficit alter. But
if all the notoriety of cudgels and cutting whips be given to the
late unfortunate affair, the difficulty of finding a substitute will
be greatly increased. The brother recognises his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) duty, and prepares
for vengeance. The injured one probably desires that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may be left
to fight her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own little battles alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, by heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) shall answer it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix had said very
grandly, when his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister had told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was engaged to a man
who was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew, engaged also to marry another woman.
Here, no doubt, was gross ill-usage, and opportunity at any rate for
threats. No money was required and no immediate action,--and Sir
Felix could act the fine gentleman and the dictatorial brother at
very little present expense. But Hetta, who ought perhaps to have
known her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) brother more thoroughly, was fool enough to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).
On the day but one following, no answer had as yet come from Roger
Carbury,--nor could as yet have come. But Hetta's mind was full of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) trouble, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) brother's threat. Felix had
forgotten that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had made a threat,--and, indeed, had thought no
more of the matter since his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you won't mention that to Mr. Montague!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mention what? Oh! about that woman, Mrs. Hurtle? Indeed I shall.
A man who does that kind of thing ought to be crushed;--and, by
heavens, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does it to you, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall be crushed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you, Felix. If it is so, I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is so! I tell you I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma has written to Roger. At least I feel sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) for? What has Roger Carbury to do with
our affairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only you said he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) says so, that is, if you and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) both
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) is to marry that woman,--I will not see Mr. Montague
again. Pray do not go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). If such a misfortune does come, it is
better to bear it and to be silent. What good can be done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave that to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, walking out of the room with much
fraternal bluster. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went forth, and at once had himself driven
to Paul Montague's lodgings. Had Hetta not been foolish enough to
remind him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) duty, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would not now have undertaken the task.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) too, no doubt, remembered as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went that duels were things of
the past, and that even fists and sticks are considered to be out of
fashion. <div class="bookquote">``Montague,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, assuming all the dignity of demeanour
that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) late sorrows had left to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I believe I am right in
saying that you are engaged to marry that American lady, Mrs.
Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let me tell you that you were never more wrong in your life.
What business have you with Mrs. Hurtle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When a man proposes to my sister, I think I've a great deal of
business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--yes; I admit that fully. If I answered you roughly, I beg
your pardon. Now as to the facts. I am not going to marry Mrs.
Hurtle. I suppose I know how you have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) name;--but as you
have heard it, I have no hesitation in telling you so much. As you
know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is to be found you can go and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) if you please.
On the other hand, it is the dearest wish of my heart to marry your
sister. I trust that will be enough for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were engaged to Mrs. Hurtle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Carbury, I don't think I'm bound to tell you all the details
of my past life. At any rate, I don't feel inclined to do so in
answer to hostile questions. I dare say you have heard enough of Mrs.
Hurtle to justify you, as your sister's brother, in asking me whether
I am in any way entangled by a connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). I tell you that
I am not. If you still doubt, I refer you to the lady herself. Beyond
that, I do not think I am called on to go; and beyond that I won't
go,--at any rate, at present.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix still blustered, and made
what capital he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could out of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) position as a brother; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took
no steps towards positive revenge. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
other, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to regard you as a brother; and if I am rough to you,
it is only because you are rough to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix was now in that part of town which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been accustomed
to haunt,--for the first time since his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) misadventure,--and, plucking
up his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) courage, resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would turn into the Beargarden. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would have a glass of sherry, and face the one or two men who would
as yet be there, and in this way gradually creep back to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) old
habits. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arrived there, the club was shut up. <div class="bookquote">``What the
deuce is Vossner about?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) watch. It was
nearly five o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rang the bell, and knocked at the door,
feeling that this was an occasion for courage. One of the servants,
in what we may call private clothes, after some delay, drew back the
bolts, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the astounding news;--The club was shut up! <div class="bookquote">``Do
you mean to say I can't come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix. The man certainly
did mean to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened the door no more than a foot,
and stood in that narrow aperture. Mr. Vossner had gone away. There
had been a meeting of the Committee, and the club was shut up.
Whatever further information rested in the waiter's bosom he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) declined
to communicate to Sir Felix Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The wrong that was done him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) filled the young baronet's
bosom with indignation. He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) had intended, he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) assured himself, to dine
at his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) club, to spend the evening there sportively, to be pleasant
among his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) chosen companions. And now the club was shut up, and
Vossner had gone away! What business had the club to be shut up? What
right had Vossner to go away? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) not paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) subscription in
advance? Throughout the world, the more wrong a man does, the more
indignant is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at wrong done to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Sir Felix almost thought that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could recover damages from the whole Committee.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went direct to Mrs. Pipkin's house. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made that half promise
of marriage in Mrs. Pipkin's hearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would come
again on the morrow. This he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not done; but of that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought
nothing. Such breaches of faith, when committed by a young man in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position, require not even an apology. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was admitted by Ruby
herself, who was of course delighted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Who do you think
is in town?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``John Crumb; but though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) came here ever so
smart, I wouldn't so much as speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), except to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to
go away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the name, felt an uncomfortable
sensation creep over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't know I'm sure what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should come
after me for, and me telling him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as plain as the nose on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face
that I never want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s not of much account,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would marry me out and out immediately, if I'd have him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>continued Ruby, who perhaps thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) honest old lover should
not be spoken of as being altogether of no account. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has
everything comfortable in the way of furniture, and all that. And
they do say he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s ever so much money in the bank. But I detest him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) pretty head, and inclining herself towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
aristocratic lover's shoulder.

<p/>This took place in the back parlour, before Mrs. Pipkin had ascended
from the kitchen prepared to disturb so much romantic bliss with
wretched references to the cold outer world. <div class="bookquote">``Well, now, Sir Felix,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``if things is square, of course you're welcome to see my
niece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what if they're round, Mrs. Pipkin?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Lothario</b></font>)</div>said the gallant, careless,
sparkling Lothario.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, or round either, so long as they're honest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ruby and I are both honest;--ain't we, Ruby? I want to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) out
to dinner, Mrs. Pipkin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) shall be back before late;--before ten;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) shall indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>Ruby inclined herself still more closely towards
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Ruby, get your hat and change your dress, and
we'll be off. I've ever so many things to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ever so many things to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)! They must be to fix a day for the
marriage, and to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) know where they were to live, and to settle
what dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) should wear,--and perhaps to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) the money to go
and buy it! Ever so many things to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) looked up into Mrs.
Pipkin's face with imploring eyes. Surely on such an occasion as this
an aunt would not expect that her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) niece should be a prisoner and a
slave. <div class="bookquote">``Have it been put in writing, Sir Felix Carbury?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>demanded
Mrs. Pipkin with cruel gravity. Mrs. Hurtle had given it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
decided opinion that Sir Felix would not really mean to marry Ruby
Ruggles unless he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) showed himself willing to do so with all the
formality of a written contract.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Writing be bothered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very well, Sir Felix. Writing do bother, very often. But
when a gentleman has intentions, a bit of writing shows it plainer
nor words. Ruby don't go no where to dine unless you puts it into
writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Pipkin!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Ruby</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the wretched Ruby. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think I'm
going to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) your wife, put it in writing. And if it be
as you don't, just say so, and walk away,--free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to be kept here a prisoner
for any one. I can go when I please. You wait, Felix, and I'll be
down in a minute.''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The girl, with a nimble spring, ran upstairs,
and began to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) dress without giving herself a moment for
thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) don't come back no more here, Sir Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) most solemn tones. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) ain't nothing to me, no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was
my poor dear husband's sister's child. There ain't no blood between
us, and won't be no disgrace. But I'd be loth to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) on the
streets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why won't you let me bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) back again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'''Cause that'd be the way to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) there. You don't mean to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>To this Sir Felix said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``You're not thinking of that.
It's just a bit of sport,--and then there she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) is, an old shoe to
be chucked away, just a rag to be swept into the dust-bin. I've
seen scores of 'em, and I'd sooner a child of mine should die in a
workus', or be starved to death. But it's all nothing to the likes o'
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't done her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) any harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, almost frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then go away, and don't do her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) any. That's Mrs. Hurtle's door open.
You go and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) can talk a deal better nor me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Hurtle hasn't been able to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own affairs very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Hurtle's a lady, Sir Felix, and a widow, and one as has seen
the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) spoke, Mrs. Hurtle came downstairs, and an
introduction, after some rude fashion, was effected between her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) and
Sir Felix. Mrs. Hurtle had heard often of Sir Felix Carbury, and was
quite as certain as Mrs. Pipkin that he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) did not mean to marry Ruby
Ruggles. In a few minutes Felix found himself alone with Mrs. Hurtle
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own room. He (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had been anxious to see the woman since he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had
heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) engagement with Paul Montague, and doubly anxious since
he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had also heard of Paul's engagement with his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) sister. It was not an
hour since Paul himself had referred him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) for corroboration of
his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) own statement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Felix Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you are doing that poor
girl no good, and are intending to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) none.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It did occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
very strongly that this could be no affair of Mrs. Hurtle's, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>), as a man of position in society, was being interfered with in an
unjustifiable manner. Aunt Pipkin wasn't even an aunt; but who was
Mrs. Hurtle? <div class="bookquote">``Would it not be better that you should leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to
become the wife of a man who is really fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could already see something in Mrs. Hurtle's eye which prevented
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once bursting into wrath;--but who was Mrs. Hurtle, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
should interfere with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm very
much obliged to you, but I don't quite know to what I owe the honour
of your--your--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Interference you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say so, but perhaps that's about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd interfere to save any woman that God ever made,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Hurtle with energy. <div class="bookquote">``We're all apt to wait a little too long, because
we're ashamed to do any little good that chance puts in our way. You
must go and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), Sir Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) may do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) pleases about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) your wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Hurtle sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Mr. Paul Montague mean to make you his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sir
Felix with an impudent swagger. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had struck the blow certainly
hard enough, and it had gone all the way home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had not surmised
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have heard aught of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own concerns. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) only barely
connected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with that Roger Carbury who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) knew, was Paul's great
friend, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had as yet never heard that Hetta Carbury was the
girl whom Paul loved. Had Paul so talked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) that this young
scamp should know all her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) story?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought awhile,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had to think for a moment,--before she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could
answer him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I do not see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, with a faint attempt at a
smile, <div class="bookquote">``that there is any parallel between the two cases. I, at any
rate, am old enough to take care of myself. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) not marry me,
I am as I was before. Will it be so with that poor girl if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) allows
herself to be taken about the town by you at night?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had desired
in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said to protect Ruby rather than herself. What could it
matter whether this young man was left in a belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was, or
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was not, about to be married?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll answer me, I'll answer you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``Does Mr.
Montague mean to make you his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not concern you to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), flashing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The
question is insolent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does concern me,--a great deal more than anything about Ruby can
concern you. And as you won't answer me, I won't answer you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, sir, that girl's fate will be upon your head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know all about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the young man who has followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up to town will probably know
where to find you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/>To such a threat as this, no answer could be made, and Sir Felix
left the room. At any rate, John Crumb was not there at present. And
were there not policemen in London? And what additional harm would
be done to John Crumb, or what increase of anger engendered in that
true lover's breast, by one additional evening's amusement? Ruby had
danced with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) so often at the Music Hall that John Crumb could
hardly be made more bellicose by the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) dining with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
on this evening. When he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) descended, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) found Ruby in the hall, all
arrayed. <div class="bookquote">``You don't come in here again to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin,
thumping the little table which stood in the passage, <div class="bookquote">``if you goes
out of that there door with that there young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>said Ruby linking herself on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Baggage! Slut!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin; <div class="bookquote">``after all I've done for you, just
as one as though you were my own flesh and blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've worked for it, I suppose;--haven't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>rejoined Ruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You send for your things to-morrow, for you don't come in here no
more. You ain't nothing to me no more nor no other girl. But I'd 've
saved you, if you'd but a' let me. As for you,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) looked at
Sir Felix,--<div class="bookquote">``only because I've lodgings to let, and because of the
lady upstairs, I'd shake you that well, you'd never come here no
more after poor girls.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>I do not think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) need have feared
any remonstrance from Mrs. Hurtle, even had she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) threat into
execution.

<p/>Sir Felix, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had had enough of Mrs. Pipkin and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
lodger, left the house with Ruby on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arm. For the moment, Ruby had
been triumphant, and was happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did not stop to consider whether
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) aunt would or would not open her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) door when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) should return
tired, and perhaps repentant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover's arm, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
best clothes, and going to have a dinner given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). And her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
lover had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had ever so many things,--ever so many
things to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would ask no impertinent questions
in the first hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) bliss. It was so pleasant to walk with
him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) up to Pentonville;--so joyous to turn into a gay enclosure,
half public-house and half tea-garden; so pleasant to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) order
the good things, which in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) company would be so nice! Who cannot
understand that even an urban Rosherville must be an Elysium to those
who have lately been eating their meals in all the gloom of a small
London underground kitchen? There we will leave Ruby in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) bliss.

<p/>At about nine that evening John Crumb called at Mrs. Pipkin's, and
was told that Ruby had gone out with Sir Felix Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hit his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
leg a blow with his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fist, and glared out of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'ll have it
hot some day,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John Crumb. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was allowed to remain waiting for
Ruby till midnight, and then, with a sorrowful heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
departure.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXI.

<p/>JOHN CRUMB FALLS INTO TROUBLE.


<p/>It was on a Friday evening, an inauspicious Friday, that poor Ruby
Ruggles had insisted on leaving the security of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) Aunt Pipkin's
house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) aristocratic and vicious lover, in spite of the
positive assurance made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) by Mrs. Pipkin that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) went forth
in such company she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) should not be allowed to return. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
you must let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Hurtle had said soon after the girl's
departure. Whereupon Mrs. Pipkin had cried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) own softness
too well to suppose it to be possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) could keep the girl
out in the streets all night; but yet it was hard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>), very
hard, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) should be so troubled. <div class="bookquote">``We usen't to have our ways
like that when I was young,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) said, sobbing. What was to be the
end of it? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) to be forced by circumstances to keep the girl
always there, let the girl's conduct be what it might? Nevertheless
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) acknowledged that Ruby must be let in when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) came back. Then,
about nine o'clock, John Crumb came; and the latter part of the
evening was more melancholy even than the first. It was impossible to
conceal the truth from John Crumb. Mrs. Hurtle saw the poor man and
told the story in Mrs. Pipkin's presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s headstrong, Mr. Crumb,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is that, ma'am. And it was along wi' the baro-nite she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was so, Mr. Crumb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Baro-nite! Well;--perhaps I shall catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) some of these
days;--went to dinner wi' him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>), did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have no dinner
here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mrs. Pipkin spoke up with a keen sense of offence. Ruby Ruggles
had had as wholesome a dinner as any young woman in London,--a
bullock's heart and potatoes,--just as much as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had pleased
to eat of it. Mrs. Pipkin could tell Mr. Crumb that there was <div class="bookquote">``no
starvation nor yet no stint in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crumb</b></font>)</div>John Crumb immediately
produced a very thick and admirably useful blue cloth cloak, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had brought up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) to London from Bungay, as a present to
the woman who had been good to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) Ruby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) did
not doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) victuals were good and plentiful, and went on to
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had made bold to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) a trifle out of respect. It
was some little time before Mrs. Pipkin would allow herself to be
appeased;--but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) permitted the garment to be placed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
shoulders. But it was done after a melancholy fashion. There was no
smiling consciousness of the bestowal of joy on the countenance of
the donor as he (<font color='blue'><b>donor</b></font>) gave it, no exuberance of thanks from the recipient
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) received it. Mrs. Hurtle, standing by, declared it to be
perfect;--but the occasion was one which admitted of no delight.
<div class="bookquote">``It's very good of you, Mr. Crumb, to think of an old woman like
me,--particularly when you've such a deal of trouble with a young
`un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like the smut in the wheat, Mrs. Pipkin, or the d'sease in the
`tatoes;--it has to be put up with, I suppose. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) very partial,
ma'am, to that young baro-nite?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>This question was asked of Mrs.
Hurtle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a fancy for the time, Mr. Crumb,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They never thinks as how their fancies may well-nigh half kill a
man!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>donor</b></font>) was silent for awhile, sitting back in his (<font color='blue'><b>donor</b></font>) chair, not
moving a limb, with his (<font color='blue'><b>donor</b></font>) eyes fastened on Mrs. Pipkin's ceiling.
Mrs. Hurtle had some work in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hand, and sat watching him (<font color='blue'><b>donor</b></font>). The
man was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) an extraordinary being,--so constant, so slow, so
unexpressive, so unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own countrymen,--willing to endure so
much, and at the same time so warm in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affections! <div class="bookquote">``Sir Felix
Carbury!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll Sir Felix him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) some of these days. If it was
only dinner, wouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) be back afore this, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose they've gone to some place of amusement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Hurtle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John Crumb in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)'s that mad after dancing as never was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where is it as 'em dances?''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>asked Crumb, getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
chair, and stretching himself. It was evident to both the ladies that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was beginning to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would follow Ruby to the music
hall. Neither of them answered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), however, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down
again. <div class="bookquote">``Does 'em dance all night at them places, Mrs. Pipkin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do pretty nearly all that they oughtn't to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Pipkin. John Crumb raised one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fists, brought it down heavily
on the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other hand, and then again sat silent for awhile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never knowed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was fond o' dancing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'd a had
dancing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) down at Bungay,--just as ready as anything. D'ye
think, ma'am, it's the dancing she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'s after, or the baro-nite?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>This
was another appeal to Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose they go together,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.

<p/>Then there was another long pause, at the end of which poor John
Crumb burst out with some violence. <div class="bookquote">``Domn him (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)! Domn him (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)! What `ad
I ever dun to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)? Nothing! Did I ever interfere wi' him (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)? Never! But
I wull. I wull. I wouldn't wonder but I'll swing for this at Bury!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Crumb, don't talk like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Crumb is a little disturbed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)'ll get over it presently,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'s a nasty slut to go and treat a young man as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'s treating
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) ain't nasty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>said the lover. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'s
crou'll--horrid crou'll. It's no more use my going down about meal
and pollard, nor business, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) up here with that baro-nite,--no,
no more nor nothin'! When I handles it I don't know whether its
middlings nor nothin' else. If I was to twist his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck, ma'am, would
you take it on yourself to say as I was wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd sooner hear that you had taken the girl away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could pretty well eat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--that's what I could. Half past eleven;
is it? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must come some time, mustn't she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Pipkin, who did
not want to burn candles all night long, declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) could give
no assurance on that head. If Ruby did come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) should, on that
night, be admitted. But Mrs. Pipkin thought that it would be better
to get up and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) in than to sit up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>). Poor Mr. Crumb did
not at once take the hint, and remained there for another half-hour,
saying little, but waiting with the hope that Ruby might come. But
when the clock struck twelve he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) must go. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
slowly collected his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) limbs and dragged them out of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That young man is a good fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hurtle as soon as the
door was closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A deal too good for Ruby Ruggles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can
maintain a wife. Mr. Carbury says as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)'s as well to do as any
tradesman down in them parts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hurtle disliked the name of Mr. Carbury, and took this last
statement as no evidence in John Crumb's favour. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that
I think better of the man for having Mr. Carbury's friendship,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carbury ain't any way like his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin, Mrs. Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think much of any of the Carburys, Mrs. Pipkin. It seems
to me that everybody here is either too humble or too overbearing.
Nobody seems content to stand firm on his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own footing and interfere
with nobody else.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>This was all Greek to poor Mrs. Pipkin. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
we may as well go to bed now. When that girl comes and knocks, of
course we must let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in. If I hear her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), I'll go down and open the
door for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pipkin made very many apologies to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) lodger for the condition
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) household. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) would remain up herself to answer the door at
the first sound, so that Mrs. Hurtle should not be disturbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) best to prevent any further annoyance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) trusted Mrs.
Hurtle would see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was endeavouring to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) duty by the
naughty wicked girl. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) came round to the point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
discourse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hoped that Mrs. Hurtle would not be induced to quit
the rooms by these disagreeable occurrences. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind saying it
now, Mrs. Hurtle, but your being here is ever so much to me. I ain't
nothing to depend on,--only lodgers, and them as is any good is so
hard to get!''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The poor woman hardly understood Mrs. Hurtle, who, as
a lodger, was certainly peculiar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) cared nothing for disturbances,
and rather liked than otherwise the task of endeavouring to assist
in the salvation of Ruby. Mrs. Hurtle begged that Mrs. Pipkin would
go to bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would not be in the least annoyed by the knocking.
Another half-hour had thus been passed by the two ladies in the
parlour after Crumb's departure. Then Mrs. Hurtle took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) candle and
had ascended the stairs half way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own sitting-room, when a loud
double knock was heard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) immediately joined Mrs. Pipkin in the
passage. The door was opened, and there stood Ruby Ruggles, John
Crumb, and two policemen! Ruby rushed in, and casting herself on
to one of the stairs began to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) hands about, and to howl
piteously. <div class="bookquote">``Laws a mercy; what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Pipkin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s been and murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>screamed Ruby. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has! He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s been and
murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This young woman is living here;--is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the policemen</b></font>)</div>asked one of the
policemen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is living here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hurtle. But now we must go back to
the adventures of John Crumb after he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had left the house.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had taken a bedroom at a small inn close to the Eastern Counties
Railway Station which he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was accustomed to frequent when business
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) up to London, and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) proposed to himself to
return. At one time there had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) would
endeavour to seek Ruby and his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) enemy among the dancing saloons of
the metropolis; and he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had asked a question with that view. But no
answer had been given which seemed to aid him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) project, and his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
purpose had been abandoned as being too complex and requiring more
intelligence than he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) gave himself credit for possessing. So he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had
turned down a street with which he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was so far acquainted as to know
that it would take him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) to the Islington Angel,--where various roads
meet, and whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would know his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) way eastwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) had just passed
the Angel, and the end of Goswell Road, and was standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
mouth open, looking about, trying to make certain of himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
would not go wrong, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would ask a policeman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
saw, and hesitating because he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) feared that the man would want to know
his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) business. Then, of a sudden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) heard a woman scream, and knew
that it was Ruby's voice. The sound was very near him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>), but in the
glimmer of the gaslight he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) could not quite see whence it came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
stood still, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) hand up to scratch his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) head under his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>)
hat,--trying to think what, in such an emergency, it would be well
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) should do. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) heard the voice distinctly, <div class="bookquote">``I won't;--I
won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and after that a scream. Then there were further words. <div class="bookquote">``It's
no good--I won't.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) was able to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) rushed
after the sound, and turning down a passage to the right which led
back into Goswell Road, saw Ruby struggling in a man's arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had
left the dancing establishment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover; and when they had come
to the turn of the passage, there had arisen a question as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
further destiny for the night. Ruby, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) well remembered Mrs.
Pipkin's threats, was minded to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) chance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) aunt's door.
Sir Felix was of opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could make a preferable arrangement
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>); and as Ruby was not at once amenable to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) arguments he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had
thought that a little gentle force might avail him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had therefore
dragged Ruby into the passage. The unfortunate one! That so ill a
chance should have come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) diversion! He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
had swallowed several tumblers of brandy and water, and was therefore
brave with reference to that interference of the police, the fear
of which might otherwise have induced him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to relinquish his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hold of
Ruby's arm when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) first raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) voice. But what amount of brandy
and water would have enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to persevere, could he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) have dreamed
that John Crumb was near him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)? On a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) found a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
coat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was swung violently away, and brought with his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) back
against the railings so forcibly as to have the breath almost knocked
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) body. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could hear Ruby's exclamation, <div class="bookquote">``If it isn't
John Crumb!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>Then there came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) a sense of coming destruction,
as though the world for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were all over; and, collapsing throughout
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) limbs, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) slunk down upon the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up, you wiper,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John Crumb. But the baronet thought it
better to cling to the ground. <div class="bookquote">``You sholl get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John, taking
him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) by the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) coat and lifting him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now, Ruby, he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s
a-going to have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John. Whereupon Ruby screamed at the top
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) voice, with a shriek very much louder than that which had at
first attracted John Crumb's notice.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Get up, you wiper.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't hit a man when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s down,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, pleading as
though for his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John;--<div class="bookquote">``but I'll hit a fellow when `un's up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>Sir Felix was little more than a child in the man's arms. John
Crumb raised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and catching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) round the neck with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left
arm,--getting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head into chancery as we used to say when we fought
at school,--struck the poor wretch some half-dozen times violently
in the face, not knowing or caring exactly where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but at
every blow obliterating a feature. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have continued had
not Ruby flown at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and rescued Sir Felix from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s
about got enough of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John Crumb as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work.
Then Sir Felix fell again to the ground, moaning fearfully. <div class="bookquote">``I know'd
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d have to have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John Crumb.

<p/>Ruby's screams of course brought the police, one arriving from each
end of the passage on the scene of action at the same time. And now
the cruellest thing of all was that Ruby in the complaints which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
made to the policemen said not a word against Sir Felix, but was
as bitter as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) knew how to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) denunciations of John Crumb.
It was in vain that John endeavoured to make the man understand
that the young woman had been crying out for protection when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
interfered. Ruby was very quick of speech and John Crumb was very
slow. Ruby swore that nothing so horrible, so cruel, so bloodthirsty
had ever been done before. Sir Felix himself when appealed to could
say nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only moan and make futile efforts to wipe away
the stream of blood from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face when the men stood him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up leaning
against the railings. And John, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) endeavoured to make the
policemen comprehend the extent of the wickedness of the young
baronet, would not say a word against Ruby. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not even in the
least angered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) denunciations of himself. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself said
sometimes afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``dropped into the baro-nite''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>just in
time, and, having been successful in this, felt no wrath against Ruby
for having made such an operation necessary.

<p/>There was soon a third policeman on the spot, and a dozen other
persons,--cab-drivers, haunters of the street by night, and houseless
wanderers, casuals who at this season of the year preferred the
pavements to the poor-house wards. They all took part against John
Crumb. Why had the big man interfered between the young woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
young man? Two or three of them wiped Sir Felix's face, and dabbed
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, and proposed this and the other remedy. Some thought that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had better be taken straight to an hospital. One lady remarked
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``so mashed and mauled''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never
<div class="bookquote">``come to''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>again. A precocious youth remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``all one
as a dead `un.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A cabman observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">''`ad it awful `eavy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To all these criticisms on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition Sir Felix himself made
no direct reply, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intimated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desire to be carried away
somewhere, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not much care whither.

<p/>At last the policemen among them decided upon a course of action.
They had learned by the united testimony of Ruby and Crumb that Sir
Felix was Sir Felix. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to be carried in a cab by one constable
to Bartholomew Hospital, who would then take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) address so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>)
might be produced and bound over to prosecute. Ruby should be even
conducted to the address she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) gave,--not half a mile from the spot
on which they now stood,--and be left there or not according to the
account which might be given of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). John Crumb must be undoubtedly
locked up in the station-house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) was the offender;--for aught that
any of them yet knew, the murderer. No one said a good word for
him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) hardly said a good word for himself, and certainly made no
objection to the treatment that had been proposed for him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>). But,
no doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was buoyed up inwardly by the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had
thoroughly thrashed his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) enemy.

<p/>Thus it came to pass that the two policemen with John Crumb and
Ruby came together to Mrs. Pipkin's door. Ruby was still loud with
complaints against the ruffian who had beaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lover,--who,
perhaps, had killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) loved one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) threatened the gallows, and
handcuffs, and perpetual imprisonment, and an action for damages
amidst her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) lamentations. But from Mrs. Hurtle the policemen did
manage to learn something of the truth. Oh yes;--the girl lived
there and was--respectable. This man whom they had arrested was
respectable also, and was the girl's proper lover. The other man who
had been beaten was undoubtedly the owner of a title; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
respectable, and was only the girl's improper lover. And John Crumb's
name was given. <div class="bookquote">``I'm John Crumb of Bungay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I ain't
afeared of nothin' nor nobody. And I ain't a been a drinking; no, I
ain't. Mauled `un! In course I've mauled `un. And I meaned it. That
ere young woman is engaged to be my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I ain't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>shouted Ruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>persisted John Crumb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, I never will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>rejoined Ruby.

<p/>John Crumb turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) a look of love, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
heart. Whereupon the senior policeman said that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) saw at a glance
how it all was, but that Mr. Crumb had better come along with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>),--just for the present. To this arrangement the unfortunate hero
from Bungay made not the slightest objection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Ruggles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hurtle, <div class="bookquote">``if that young man doesn't conquer
you at last you can't have a heart in your bosom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed and I have then, and I don't mean to give it him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if it's ever
so. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been and killed Sir Felix.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Hurtle in a whisper to Mrs.
Pipkin expressed a wicked wish that it might be so. After that the
three women all went to bed.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``ASK HIMSELF.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger Carbury when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) received the letter from Hetta's mother
desiring him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew of Paul Montague's
connection with Mrs. Hurtle found himself quite unable to write a
reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) endeavoured to ask himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would do in such a case
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) himself were not personally concerned. What advice in this
emergency would he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) give to the mother and what to the daughter, were
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) himself uninterested? He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was sure that, as Hetta's cousin and
acting as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) were Hetta's brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that
Paul Montague's entanglement with that American woman should have
forbidden him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at any rate for the present to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand to any
other lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew enough of all the circumstances
to be sure that such would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) decision. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had seen Mrs. Hurtle
with Montague at Lowestoft, and had known that they were staying
together as friends at the same hotel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had come
to England with the express purpose of enforcing the fulfilment of
an engagement which Montague had often acknowledged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that
Montague made frequent visits to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had, indeed, been
told by Montague himself that, let the cost be what it might, the
engagement should be and in fact had been broken off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thoroughly
believed the man's word, but put no trust whatever in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) firmness.
And, hitherto, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had no reason whatever for supposing that Mrs.
Hurtle had consented to be abandoned. What father, what elder brother
would allow a daughter or a sister to become engaged to a man
embarrassed by such difficulties? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly had counselled
Montague to rid himself of the trammels by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had surrounded
himself;--but not on that account could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) think that the man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
present condition was fit to engage himself to another woman.

<p/>All this was clear to Roger Carbury. But then it had been equally
clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not, as a man of honour, assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own
cause by telling a tale,--which tale had become known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) as the
friend of the man against whom it would have to be told. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
resolved upon that as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left Montague and Mrs. Hurtle together upon
the sands at Lowestoft. But what was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do now? The girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
loved had confessed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) love for the other man,--that man, who in
seeking the girl's love, had been as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought so foul a traitor
to himself! That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would hold himself as divided from the man by a
perpetual and undying hostility he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had determined. That his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love for
the woman would be equally perpetual he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite sure. Already there
were floating across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain ideas of perpetuating his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name in the
person of some child of Hetta's,--but with the distinct understanding
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the child's father should never see each other. No more
than twenty-four hours had intervened between the receipt of Paul's
letter and that from Lady Carbury,--but during those four-and-twenty
hours he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had almost forgotten Mrs. Hurtle. The girl was gone from
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought only of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own loss and of Paul's perfidy. Then
came the direct question as to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was called upon for a direct
answer. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know anything of facts relating to the presence of
a certain Mrs. Hurtle in London which were of a nature to make it
inexpedient that Hetta should accept Paul Montague as her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) betrothed
lover? Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) did. The facts were all familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). But
how was he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to tell the facts? In what words was he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to answer such
a letter? If he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) told the truth as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knew it how was he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to secure
himself against the suspicion of telling a story against his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) rival in
order that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) might assist himself, or at any rate, punish the rival?

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could not trust himself to write an answer to Lady Carbury's
letter he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would go to London. If he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) must tell the
story he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could tell it better face to face than by any written words.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) made the journey, arrived in town late in the evening, and
knocked at the door in Welbeck Street between ten and eleven on the
morning after the unfortunate meeting which took place between Sir
Felix and John Crumb. The page when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) opened the door looked as a
page should look when the family to which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is attached is suffering
from some terrible calamity. <div class="bookquote">``My lady''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>had been summoned to the
hospital to see Sir Felix who was,--as the page reported,--in a very
bad way indeed. The page did not exactly know what had happened, but
supposed that Sir Felix had lost most of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) limbs by this time. Yes;
Miss Carbury was up-stairs; and would no doubt see her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), too, was in a very bad condition; and dreadfully put about. That
poor Hetta should be <div class="bookquote">``put about''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) brother in the hospital and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lover in the toils of an abominable American woman was natural
enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this about Felix?''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Roger. The new trouble always has
precedence over those which are of earlier date.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh Roger, I am so glad to see you. Felix did not come home last
night, and this morning there came a man from the hospital in the
city to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Somebody,--somebody has,--beaten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta whimpering. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) told the story as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew it. The messenger from the
hospital had declared that the young man was in no danger and that
none of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bones were broken, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was terribly bruised about
the face, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were in a frightful condition, sundry of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
teeth knocked out, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips cut open. But, the messenger had
gone on to say, the house surgeon had seen no reason why the young
gentleman should not be taken home. <div class="bookquote">``And mamma has gone to fetch
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's John Crumb,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger. Hetta had never heard of John Crumb,
and simply stared into her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) cousin's face. <div class="bookquote">``You have not been told
about John Crumb? No;--you would not hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should John Crumb beat Felix like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say, Hetta, that women are the cause of most troubles that
occur in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The girl blushed up to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes, as though the
whole story of Felix's sin and folly had been told to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If it be
as I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>continued Roger, <div class="bookquote">``John Crumb has considered himself to
be aggrieved and has thus avenged himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you--know of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes indeed;--very well. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a neighbour of mine and was in love
with a girl, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife
and have been good to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a home to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and is an
honest man with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have been safe and respected and
happy. Your brother saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew the story, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been told by myself that this honest fellow had placed his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
happiness on the girl's love, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought,--well, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought
that such a pretty thing as this girl was too good for John Crumb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Felix has been going to marry Miss Melmotte!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're old-fashioned, Hetta. It used to be the way,--to be off with
the old love before you are on with the new; but that seems to be all
changed now. Such fine young fellows as there are now can be in love
with two at once. That I fear is what Felix has thought;--and now he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
has been punished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know all about it then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I don't know. But I think it has been so. I do know that John

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) heard the story hardly knew whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) cousin, in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
manner of telling the story, was speaking of that other man, of that
stranger of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had never heard, or of himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would have
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wife and have been good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had a home to offer
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was an honest man with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would have been safe and

were her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own case of which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) spoke. And then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) talked of the
old-fashioned way, of being off with the old love before you are on
with the new, had he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) not alluded to Paul Montague and this story of
the American woman? But, if so, it was not for Hetta to notice it
by words. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) must speak more plainly than that before she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could be
supposed to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) alluded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own condition. <div class="bookquote">``It is very

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that nothing ever will be happy for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was longing to be told something of Mrs. Hurtle, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did not
as yet dare to ask the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know whether to wait for your mother or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) after

not you that I reproach. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been if possible more false
than Felix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Roger, how has he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) been false?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Still he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was not wishful to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) the story of Mrs. Hurtle. The
treachery of which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was speaking was that which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had thought had
been committed by his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) friend towards himself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should have left

he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had to tell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was bound to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) know that it was so. That
horrid story of Mrs. Hurtle;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would listen to that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could
hear it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would be all ears for that. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could not admit that

won't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), Hetta. Whether you are his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife, or another man's,

As to not coveting,--how is a man to cease to covet that which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
always coveted? But I shall be separated from you. Should I be dying,
then I should send for you. You are the very essence of my life. I
have no dream of happiness otherwise than as connected with you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was bid, and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) brother in the

descend from the cab, and hurry across the pavement into the house,
and then, without speaking a word to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, hid himself in the
dining-room. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face was strapped up with plaister so that not a
feature was visible; and both his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyes were swollen and blue; part of
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) beard had been cut away, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) physiognomy had altogether been
so treated that even the page would hardly have known him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Roger is
up-stairs, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta in the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) heard about Felix;--has he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) come about that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has heard only what I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has come because of your

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>On this occasion Roger was saved from the annoyance of any personal
intercourse with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin Felix. The unfortunate one was made as
comfortable as circumstances would permit in the parlour, and Lady
Carbury then went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin in the drawing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
learned the truth with some fair approach to accuracy, though Sir
Felix himself had of course lied as to every detail. There are some
circumstances so distressing in themselves as to make lying almost
a necessity. When a young man has behaved badly about a woman, when
a young man has been beaten without returning a blow, when a young
man's pleasant vices are brought directly under a mother's eyes, what
can he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do but lie? How could Sir Felix tell the truth about that rash
encounter? But the policeman who had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) to the hospital had
told all that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) knew. The man who had thrashed the baronet had been
called Crumb, and the thrashing had been given on the score of a
young woman called Ruggles. So much was known at the hospital, and so
much could not be hidden by any lies which Sir Felix might tell. And
when Sir Felix swore that a policeman was holding him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) while Crumb
was beating him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>), no one believed him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>). In such cases the liar does
not expect to be believed. He (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) knows that his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) disgrace will be made
public, and only hopes to be saved from the ignominy of declaring it
with his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) own words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``It is

If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had spoken his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would have declared that Sir
Felix had reached an age at which, if a man will go headlong to
destruction, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must go headlong to destruction. Thinking as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see no possible salvation for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I

the hopes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had indulged,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) literary aspirations, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
Tuesday evenings, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) desire for society, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) Brounes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) Alfs, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) Bookers, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) pleasant drawing-room, and the determination which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had made that now in the afternoon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) days she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would become
somebody in the world. Must she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) give it all up and retire to the
dreariness of some French town because it was no longer possible that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should live in London with such a son as hers? There seemed to be
a cruelty in this beyond all cruelties that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had hitherto endured.
This was harder even than those lies which had been told of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) when
almost in fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had run from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) husband's house. But
yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) must do even this if in no other way she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son could
be together. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would be so. I only wish
that I might die, so that were an end of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might go out to one of the Colonies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--be sent away that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might kill himself with drink in the
bush, and so be got rid of. I have heard of that before. Wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
goes I shall go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div><p/>As the reader knows, Roger Carbury had not latterly held this cousin
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in much esteem. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to be worldly and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
to be unprincipled. But now, at this moment, her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) exceeding love for
the son whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could no longer pretend to defend, wiped out all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
sins. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) forgot the visit made to Carbury under false pretences, and
the Melmottes, and all the little tricks which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had detected, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) appreciation of an affection which was pure and beautiful. <div class="bookquote">``If
you like to let your house for a period,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``mine is open to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Felix?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) there. I am all alone in the world. I can make a
home for myself at the cottage. It is empty now. If you think that
would save you you can try it for six months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And turn you out of your own house? No, Roger. I cannot do that.
And, Roger;--what is to be done about Hetta?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta herself had
retreated, leaving Roger and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother alone together, feeling sure
that there would be questions asked and answered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) absence
respecting Mrs. Hurtle, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) presence would prevent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wished
it could have been otherwise--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might have been allowed to
hear it all herself--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was sure that the story coming through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother would not savour so completely of unalloyed truth as if
told to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hetta can be trusted to judge for herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) has just accepted this young man? Is
it not true that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is even now living with an American woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has promised to marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--that is not true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is true, then? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not engaged to the woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I do not know that even that is true. When
last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke to me about it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared that the engagement was at
an end. I have told Hetta to ask himself. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
has heard of this woman from you, and that it behoves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to know the
truth. I do not love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Lady Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no longer any place
in my friendship. But I think that if Hetta asks him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply what is
the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) connexion with Mrs. Hurtle, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) the
truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger did not again see Hetta before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) left the house, nor did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) see his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin Felix at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had now done all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could
do by his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) journey up to London, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) returned on that day back
to Carbury. Would it not be better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), in spite of the
protestations which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had made, to dismiss the whole family from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind? There could be no other love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) must be desolate
and alone. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might then save himself from a world of cares,
and might gradually teach himself to live as though there were no
such woman as Hetta Carbury in the world. But no! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would not
allow himself to believe that this could be right. The very fact of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love made it a duty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),--made it almost the first of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
duties,--to watch over the interests of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) loved and of those who
belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>But among those so belonging he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not recognise Paul Montague.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXIII.

<p/>MARIE``S FORTUNE.


<p/>When Marie Melmotte assured Sir Felix Carbury that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) father had
already endowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) with a large fortune which could not be taken
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) without her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own consent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) spoke no more than the truth.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew of the matter almost as little as it was possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
should know. As far as reticence on the subject was compatible with
the object he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had in view Melmotte had kept from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) all knowledge
of the details of the arrangement. But it had been necessary when
the thing was done to explain, or to pretend to explain, much; and
Marie's memory and also her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) intelligence had been strong beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
father's anticipation. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was deriving a very considerable income
from a large sum of money which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had invested in foreign funds in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) name, and had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to execute a power of attorney enabling
him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) to draw this income on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) behalf. This he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) had done fearing
shipwreck in the course which he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) meant to run, and resolved that, let
circumstances go as they might, there should still be left enough
to him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) of the money which he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) had realised to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) to live
in comfort and luxury, should he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) be doomed to live in obscurity,
or even in infamy. He (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) had sworn to himself solemnly that under no
circumstances would he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) allow this money to go back into the vortex of
his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) speculations, and hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) had been true to his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) oath. Though
bankruptcy and apparent ruin might be imminent he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) would not bolster
up his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) credit by the use of this money even though it might appear
at the moment that the money would be sufficient for the purpose. If
such a day should come, then, with that certain income, he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) would make
himself happy, if possible, or at any rate luxurious, in whatever
city of the world might know least of his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) antecedents, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>)
the warmest welcome on behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) wealth. Such had been his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) scheme
of life. But he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) had failed to consider various circumstances. His (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>)
daughter might be untrue to him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>), or in the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marriage
might fail to release his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) property,--or it might be that the very
money should be required to dower his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) daughter. Or there might come
troubles on him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) so great that even the certainty of a future income
would not enable him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) to bear them. Now, at this present moment,
his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) mind was tortured by great anxiety. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) to resume this
property it would more than enable him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) to pay all that was due to
the Longestaffes. It would do that and tide him (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) for a time over some
other difficulties. Now in regard to the Longestaffes themselves, he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>)
certainly had no desire to depart from the rule which he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) had made
for himself, on their behalf. Were it necessary that a crash should
come they would be as good creditors as any other. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) was
painfully alive to the fact that something beyond simple indebtedness
was involved in that transaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) had with his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) own hand traced
Dolly Longestaffe's signature on the letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) had found in old
Mr. Longestaffe's drawer. He (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) had found it in an envelope, addressed
by the elder Mr. Longestaffe to Messrs. Slow and Bideawhile, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had himself posted this letter in a pillar-box near to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) own
house. In the execution of this manoeuvre, circumstances had greatly
befriended him (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had become the tenant of Mr. Longestaffe's
house, and at the same time had only been the joint tenant of Mr.
Longestaffe's study,--so that Mr. Longestaffe's papers were almost in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) very hands. To pick a lock was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) an accomplishment long
since learned. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) science in that line did not go so far as
to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) to replace the bolt in its receptacle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had picked
a lock, had found the letter prepared by Mr. Bideawhile with its
accompanying envelope, and had then already learned enough of the
domestic circumstances of the Longestaffe family to feel assured that
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) could assist the expedition of this hitherto uncompleted
letter by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) own skill, the letter would never reach its intended
destination. In all this fortune had in some degree befriended him (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>).
The circumstances being as they were it was hardly possible that the
forgery should be discovered. Even though the young man were to swear
that the signature was not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), even though the old man were to swear
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left that drawer properly locked with the unsigned letter
in it, still there could be no evidence. People might think. People
might speak. People might feel sure. And then a crash would come. But
there would still be that ample fortune on which to retire and eat
and drink and make merry for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days.

<p/>Then there came annoying complications in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs. What had
been so easy in reference to that letter which Dolly Longestaffe
never would have signed, was less easy but still feasible in another
matter. Under the joint pressure of immediate need, growing ambition,
and increasing audacity it had been done. Then the rumours that
were spread abroad,--which to Melmotte were serious indeed,--they
named, at any rate in reference to Dolly Longestaffe, the very thing
that had been done. Now if that, or the like of that, were brought
actually home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), if twelve jurymen could be got to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had done that thing, of what use then would be all that money? When
that fear arose, then there arose also the question whether it might
not be well to use the money to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) from such ruin, if it might
be so used. No doubt all danger in that Longestaffe affair might
be bought off by payment of the price stipulated for the Pickering
property. Neither would Dolly Longestaffe nor Squercum, of whom Mr.
Melmotte had already heard, concern himself in this matter if the
money claimed were paid. But then the money would be as good as
wasted by such a payment, if, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) firmly believed, no sufficient
evidence could be produced to prove the thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had done.

<p/>But the complications were so many! Perhaps in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) admiration for the
country of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) adoption Mr. Melmotte had allowed himself to attach
higher privileges to the British aristocracy than do in truth belong
to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) heart believe that could he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) be known to all
the world as the father-in-law of the eldest son of the Marquis of
Auld Reekie he (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) would become, not really free of the law, but almost
safe from its fangs in regard to such an affair as this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) could so use the family with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) would be connected as to
force from it that protection which he (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) would need. And then again, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Reekie</b></font>) could tide over this bad time, how glorious would it be to have a
British Marquis for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son-in-law! Like many others he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had failed
altogether to enquire when the pleasure to himself would come, or
what would be its nature. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did believe that such a marriage
would add a charm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) life. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) knew that Lord Nidderdale could
not be got to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) daughter without the positive assurance of
absolute property, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) did think that the income which might thus
be transferred with Marie, though it fell short of that which had
been promised, might suffice for the time; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had already given
proof to the Marquis's lawyer that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) daughter was possessed of the
property in question.

<p/>And indeed, there was another complication which had arisen within
the last few days and which had startled Mr. Melmotte very much
indeed. On a certain morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had sent for Marie to the study and
had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should require her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) signature in reference to a
deed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) what deed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had replied that it would be a
document regarding money and reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had signed such a
deed once before, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that it was all in the way of business.
It was not necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) should ask any more questions as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
would be wanted only to sign the paper. Then Marie astounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), not
merely by showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) understood a great deal more of the
transaction than he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had thought,--but also by a positive refusal to
sign anything at all. The reader may understand that there had been
many words between them. <div class="bookquote">``I know, papa. It is that you may have the
money to do what you like with. You have been so unkind to me about
Sir Felix Carbury that I won't do it. If I ever marry the money will
belong to my husband!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) breath almost failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) listened
to these words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not know whether to approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) with threats,
with entreaties, or with blows. Before the interview was over he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had
tried all three. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could and would put her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) in
prison for conduct so fraudulent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) besought her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) not to ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
parent by such monstrous perversity. And at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) by both
arms and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) violently. But Marie was quite firm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might cut
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to pieces; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would sign nothing. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you thought Sir
Felix would have had the entire sum,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father with deriding
scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would;--if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had the spirit to take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>answered Marie.

<p/>This was another reason for sticking to the Nidderdale plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would no doubt lose the immediate income, but in doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would
secure the Marquis. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was therefore induced, on weighing in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
nicest-balanced scales the advantages and disadvantages, to leave the
Longestaffes unpaid and to let Nidderdale have the money. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
could make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) mind to such a course with any conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
was doing the best for himself. The dangers on all sides were very
great! But at the present moment audacity recommended itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>),
and this was the boldest stroke. Marie had now said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would
accept Nidderdale,--or the sweep at the crossing.

<p/>On Monday morning,--it was on the preceding Thursday that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) famous speech in Parliament,--one of the Bideawhiles had come
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) in the City. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had told Mr. Bideawhile that all the world
knew that just at the present moment money was very <div class="bookquote">``tight''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>in the
City. <div class="bookquote">``We are not asking for payment of a commercial debt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bideawhile, <div class="bookquote">``but for the price of a considerable property which you
have purchased.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>Mr. Melmotte had suggested that the characteristics
of the money were the same, let the sum in question have become due
how it might. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) offered to make the payment in two bills at
three and six months' date, with proper interest allowed. But this
offer Mr. Bideawhile scouted with indignation, demanding that the
title-deeds might be restored to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no right whatever to demand the title-deeds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said
Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``You can only claim the sum due, and I have already told
you how I propose to pay it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bideawhile was nearly beside himself with dismay. In the whole
course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) business, in all the records of the very respectable
firm to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) belonged, there had never been such a thing as this.
Of course Mr. Longestaffe had been the person to blame,--so at least
all the Bideawhiles declared among themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been so anxious
to have dealings with the man of money that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had insisted that the
title-deeds should be given up. But then the title-deeds had not been
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) to surrender. The Pickering estate had been the joint property of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son. The house had been already pulled down, and now the
purchaser offered bills in lieu of the purchase money! <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean
to tell me, Mr. Melmotte, that you have not got the money to pay for
what you have bought, and that nevertheless the title-deeds have
already gone out of your hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have property to ten times the value, twenty times the value,
thirty times the value,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte proudly; <div class="bookquote">``but you must know
I should think by this time that a man engaged in large affairs
cannot always realise such a sum as eighty thousand pounds at a day's
notice.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bideawhile without using language that was absolutely
vituperative gave Mr. Melmotte to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) client had been robbed, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should at once take
whatever severest steps the law put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) power. As Mr. Melmotte
shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) shoulders and made no further reply, Mr. Bideawhile
could only take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) departure.

<p/>The attorney, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) was bound to be staunch to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) own client,
and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) own house in opposition to Mr. Squercum, nevertheless was
becoming doubtful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) own mind as to the genuineness of the letter
which Dolly was so persistent in declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had not signed.
Mr. Longestaffe himself, who was at any rate an honest man, had given
it as his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) opinion that Dolly had not signed the letter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son had
certainly refused to sign it once, and as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) knew could have
had no opportunity of signing it since. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was all but sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
had left the letter under lock and key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own drawer in the room
which had latterly become Melmotte's study as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own. Then,
on entering the room in Melmotte's presence,--their friendship at the
time having already ceased,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) drawer was open. This
same Mr. Bideawhile was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) at the time. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say
that I have opened your drawer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte. Mr. Longestaffe
had become very red in the face and had replied by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
certainly made no such accusation, but as certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not left
the drawer unlocked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own habits and was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
never left that drawer open in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">``Then you must have changed
the habits of your life on this occasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Melmotte with
spirit. Mr. Longestaffe would trust himself to no other word within
the house, but, when they were out in the street together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) assured
the lawyer that certainly that drawer had been left locked, and that
to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) belief the letter unsigned had been left within
the drawer. Mr. Bideawhile could only remark that it was the most
unfortunate circumstance with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had ever been concerned.

<p/>The marriage with Nidderdale would upon the whole be the best thing,
if it could only be accomplished. The reader must understand that
though Mr. Melmotte had allowed himself considerable poetical licence
in that statement as to property thirty times as great as the price
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ought to have paid for Pickering, still there was property.
The man's speculations had been so great and so wide that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not
really know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owned, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did know that at
the present moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was driven very hard for large sums. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chief
trust for immediate money was in Cohenlupe, in whose hands had really
been the manipulation of the shares of the Mexican railway. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
trusted much to Cohenlupe,--more than it had been customary with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)
to trust to any man. Cohenlupe assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) that nothing could be done
with the railway shares at the present moment. They had fallen under
the panic almost to nothing. Now in the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) trouble Melmotte
wanted money from the great railway, but just because he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wanted money
the great railway was worth nothing. Cohenlupe told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) must
tide over the evil hour,--or rather over an evil month. It was at
Cohenlupe's instigation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) had offered the two bills to Mr.
Bideawhile. <div class="bookquote">``Offer 'em again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cohenlupe/Mr. Cohenlupe/MR. COHENLUPE</b></font>)</div>said Cohenlupe. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must take the
bills sooner or later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>On the Monday afternoon Melmotte met Lord Nidderdale in the lobby
of the House. <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Marie lately?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said. Nidderdale had
been assured that morning, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father's lawyer, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father's
presence, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) married Miss Melmotte at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would
undoubtedly become possessed of an income amounting to something over
#5,000 a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had intended to get more than that,--and was hardly
prepared to accept Marie at such a price; but then there probably
would be more. No doubt there was a difficulty about Pickering.
Melmotte certainly had been raising money. But this might probably be
an affair of a few weeks. Melmotte had declared that Pickering should
be made over to the young people at the marriage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father had
recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to get the girl to name a day. The marriage could be
broken off at the last day if the property were not forthcoming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going up to your house almost immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find the women at tea to a certainty between five and six,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXIV.

<p/>MELMOTTE MAKES A FRIEND.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been thinking any more about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Lord Nidderdale said to
the girl as soon as Madame Melmotte had succeeded in leaving them
alone together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought ever so much more about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's the result?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,--I'll have you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale, throwing himself on the sofa close
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) might put his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) waist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a moment, Lord Nidderdale,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might as well call me John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then wait a moment,--John. You think you might as well marry me,
though you don't love me a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not true, Marie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes it is;--it's quite true. And I think just the same,--that I
might as well marry you, though I don't love you a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I don't feel like it just at present. You had better
know the exact truth, you know. I have told my father that I did not
think you'd ever come again, but that if you did I would accept you.
But I'm not going to tell any stories about it. You know who I've
been in love with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can't be in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? I can't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I know that. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were to come to
me, I don't think that I would. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has behaved bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I behaved bad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). You never did care, and you never said you cared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,--I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at first. You say it now because you think that I shall like it.
But it makes no difference now. I don't mind about your arm being
there if we are to be married, only it's just as well for both of us
to look on it as business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very hard you are, Marie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I ain't. I wasn't hard to Sir Felix Carbury, and so I tell you.
I did love him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you have found him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) out now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s a poor creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) has just been thrashed, you know, in the streets,--most
horribly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie had not been told of this, and started back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
lover's arms. <div class="bookquote">``You hadn't heard it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has thrashed him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to tell the story against him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), but they say he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) has been
cut about in a terrible manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should anybody beat him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) do anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a young lady in the question, Marie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A young lady! What young lady? I don't believe it. But it's nothing
to me. I don't care about anything, Lord Nidderdale;--not a bit. I
suppose you've made up all that out of your own head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, no. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was beaten, and I believe it was about a
young woman. But it signifies nothing to me, and I don't suppose it
signifies much to you. Don't you think we might fix a day, Marie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. <div class="bookquote">``The longer it's put off the
better I shall like it;--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I'm so detestable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,--you ain't detestable. I think you are a very good fellow; only
you don't care for me. But it is detestable not being able to do what
one wants. It's detestable having to quarrel with everybody and never
to be good friends with anybody. And it's horribly detestable having
nothing on earth to give one any interest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't take any interest in me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose you try. Wouldn't you like to know anything about the place
where we live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a castle, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--Castle Reekie; ever so many hundred years old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate old places. I should like a new house, and a new dress, and
a new horse every week,--and a new lover. Your father lives at the
castle. I don't suppose we are to go and live there too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be there sometimes. When shall it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The year after next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Marie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't be ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may manage it all just as you like with papa. Oh, yes,--kiss
me; of course you may. If I'm to belong to you what does it matter?
No;--I won't say that I love you. But if ever I do say it, you
may be sure it will be true. That's more than you can say of
yourself,--John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/>So the interview was over and Nidderdale walked back to the house
thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) lady love, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was able to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) mind to
any operation of thinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was fully determined to go on with it.
As far as the girl herself was concerned, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had, in these latter
days, become much more attractive to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had first known
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) certainly was not a fool. And, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) could not tell
himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was altogether like a lady, still she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a manner
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) think that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would be able to live with
ladies. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) did think that, in spite of all she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said to the
contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was becoming fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>),--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) certainly had become
fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Have you been up with the ladies?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Melmotte asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does Marie say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you must fix the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll have it very soon then;--some time next month. You'll want to
get away in August. And to tell the truth so shall I. I never was
worked so hard in my life as I've been this summer. The election and
that horrid dinner had something to do with it. And I don't mind
telling you that I've had a fearful weight on my mind in reference to
money. I never had to find so many large sums in so short a time! And
I'm not quite through it yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder why you gave the dinner then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy,'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--it was very pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to call the son of a
marquis his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) dear boy,--<div class="bookquote">``as regards expenditure that was a flea-bite.
Nothing that I could spend myself would have the slightest effect
upon my condition,--one way or the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it could be the same way with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you chose to go into business with me instead of taking Marie's
money out, it very soon would be so with you. But the burden is very
great. I never know whence these panics arise, or why they come, or
whither they go. But when they do come, they are like a storm at sea.
It is only the strong ships that can stand the fury of the winds and
waves. And then the buffeting which a man gets leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only half
the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was. I've had it very hard this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are getting right now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I am getting right. I am not in any fear if you mean that. I
don't mind telling you everything as it is settled now that you are
to be Marie's husband. I know that you are honest, and that if you
could hurt me by repeating what I say you wouldn't do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I would not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I've no partner,--nobody that is bound to know my affairs.
My wife is the best woman in the world, but is utterly unable to
understand anything about it. Of course I can't talk freely to Marie.
Cohenlupe whom you see so much with me is all very well,--in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) way,
but I never talk over my affairs with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is concerned with me in
one or two things,--our American railway for instance, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has no
interest generally in my house. It is all on my own shoulders, and
I can tell you the weight is a little heavy. It will be the greatest
comfort to me in the world if I can get you to have an interest in
the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose I could ever really be any good at business,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>said
the modest young lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't come and work, I suppose. I shouldn't expect that. But
I should be glad to think that I could tell you how things are going
on. Of course you heard all that was said just before the election.
For forty-eight hours I had a very bad time of it then. The fact
was that Alf and they who were supporting him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) thought that they
could carry the election by running me down. They were at it for
a fortnight,--perfectly unscrupulous as to what they said or what
harm they might do me and others. I thought that very cruel. They
couldn't get their man in, but they could and did have the effect of
depreciating my property suddenly by nearly half a million of money.
Think what that is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand how it could be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you don't understand how delicate a thing is credit. They
persuaded a lot of men to stay away from that infernal dinner, and
consequently it was spread about the town that I was ruined. The
effect upon shares which I held was instantaneous and tremendous. The
Mexican railway were at 117, and they fell from that in two days to
something quite nominal,--so that selling was out of the question.
Cohenlupe and I between us had about 8,000 of these shares. Think
what that comes to!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Nidderdale tried to calculate what it did come
to, but failed altogether. <div class="bookquote">``That's what I call a blow;--a terrible
blow. When a man is concerned as I am with money interests, and
concerned largely with them all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is of course exchanging one
property for another every day of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life,--according as the markets
go. I don't keep such a sum as that in one concern as an investment.
Nobody does. Then when a panic comes, don't you see how it hits?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will they never go up again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes;--perhaps higher than ever. But it will take time. And in the
meantime I am driven to fall back upon property intended for other
purposes. That's the meaning of what you hear about that place down
in Sussex which I bought for Marie. I was so driven that I was
obliged to raise forty or fifty thousand wherever I could. But that
will be all right in a week or two. And as for Marie's money,--that,
you know, is settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) quite succeeded in making Nidderdale believe every word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
spoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) produced also a friendly feeling in the young man's
bosom, with something approaching to a desire that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) might be of
service to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) future father-in-law. Hazily, as through a thick fog,
Lord Nidderdale thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) did see something of the troubles, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had long seen something of the glories, of commerce on an extended
scale, and an idea occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) that it might be almost more
exciting than whist or unlimited loo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) resolved too that whatever
the man might tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should never be divulged. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on this
occasion somewhat captivated by Melmotte, and went away from the
interview with a conviction that the financier was a big man;--one
with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could sympathise, and to whom in a certain way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
become attached.

<p/>And Melmotte himself had derived positive pleasure even from a
simulated confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) son-in-law. It had been pleasant to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to talk as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were talking to a young friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
trusted. It was impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could really admit any one to a
participation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) secrets. It was out of the question that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
should ever allow himself to be betrayed into speaking the truth of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own affairs. Of course every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had said to Nidderdale had
been a lie, or intended to corroborate lies. But it had not been
only on behalf of the lies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had talked after this fashion.
Even though his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) friendship with the young man were but a mock
friendship,--though it would too probably be turned into bitter
enmity before three months had passed by,--still there was a pleasure
in it. The Grendalls had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) since the day of the dinner,--Miles
having sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) a letter up from the country complaining of severe
illness. It was a comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) to have someone to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) could
speak, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) much preferred Nidderdale to Miles Grendall.

<p/>This conversation took place in the smoking-room. When it was over
Melmotte went into the House, and Nidderdale strolled away to
the Beargarden. The Beargarden had been opened again though with
difficulty, and with diminished luxury. Nor could even this be done
without rigid laws as to the payment of ready money. Herr Vossner had
never more been heard of, but the bills which Vossner had left unpaid
were held to be good against the club, whereas every note of hand
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) had taken from the members was left in the possession of Mr.
Flatfleece. Of course there was sorrow and trouble at the Beargarden;
but still the institution had become so absolutely necessary to its
members that it had been reopened under a new management. No one had
felt this need more strongly during every hour of the day,--of the
day as he (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) counted his (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) days, rising as he (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) did about an hour after noon
and going to bed three or four hours after midnight,--than did Dolly
Longestaffe. The Beargarden had become so much to him (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) had
begun to doubt whether life would be even possible without such a
resort for his (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) hours. But now the club was again open, and Dolly
could have his (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) dinner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) bottle of wine with the luxury to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) was accustomed.

<p/>But at this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) was almost mad with the sense of injury.
Circumstances had held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) a prospect of almost unlimited ease
and indulgence. The arrangement made as to the Pickering estate would
pay all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) debts, would disembarrass his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) own property, and would
still leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) a comfortable sum in hand. Squercum had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) would stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) terms he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) would surely get them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had stuck
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) terms and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had got them. And now the property was sold, and
the title-deeds gone,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had not received a penny! He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) did not
know whom to be loudest in abusing,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) father, the Bideawhiles, or
Mr. Melmotte. And then it was said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had signed that letter! He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
was very open in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) manner of talking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) misfortune at the
club. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father was the most obstinate old fool that ever lived. As
for the Bideawhiles,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would bring an action against them. Squercum
had explained all that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>). But Melmotte was the biggest rogue
the world had ever produced. <div class="bookquote">``By George! the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``must
be coming to an end. There's that infernal scoundrel sitting in
Parliament just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) had not robbed me of my property, and forged
my name, and--and--by George! he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ought to be hung. If any man ever
deserved to be hung, that man deserves to be hung.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) spoke
openly in the coffee-room of the club, and was still speaking as
Nidderdale was taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) seat at one of the tables. Dolly had been
dining, and had turned round upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) chair so as to face some
half-dozen men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was addressing.

<p/>Nidderdale leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) chair walked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) very gently. <div class="bookquote">``Dolly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do not go on in that way about Melmotte when I am in the
room. I have no doubt you are mistaken, and so you'll find out in a
day or two. You don't know Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistaken!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Dolly still continued to exclaim with a loud voice. <div class="bookquote">``Am
I mistaken in supposing that I haven't been paid my money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it has been owing very long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I mistaken in supposing that my name has been forged to a
letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you are mistaken if you think that Melmotte had anything
to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Squercum says--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind Squercum. We all know what are the suspicions of a fellow
of that kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd believe Squercum a deuced sight sooner than Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Dolly. I know more probably of Melmotte's affairs than
you do or perhaps than anybody else. If it will induce you to remain
quiet for a few days and to hold your tongue here,--I'll make myself
responsible for the entire sum he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) owes you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/>Nidderdale was endeavouring to speak so that only Dolly should hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), and probably nobody else did hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>); but Dolly would not lower
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``That's out of the question, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``How
could I take your money? The truth is, Nidderdale, the man is a
thief, and so you'll find out, sooner or later. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has broken open a
drawer in my father's room and forged my name to a letter. Everybody
knows it. Even my governor knows it now,--and Bideawhile. Before many
days are over you'll find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) will be in gaol for forgery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/>This was very unpleasant, as every one knew that Nidderdale was
either engaged or becoming engaged to Melmotte's daughter. <div class="bookquote">``Since you
will speak about it in this public way--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>began Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it ought to be spoken about in a public way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I deny it as publicly. I can't say anything about the letter except
that I am sure Mr. Melmotte did not put your name to it. From what I
understand there seems to have been some blunder between your father
and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lawyer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly; <div class="bookquote">``but it doesn't excuse Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the money, there can be no more doubt that it will be paid
than that I stand here. What is it?--twenty-five thousand, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighty thousand, the whole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--eighty thousand. It's impossible to suppose that such a man
as Melmotte shouldn't be able to raise eighty thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) do it then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>asked Dolly.

<p/>All this was very unpleasant and made the club less social than
it used to be in old days. There was an attempt that night to get
up a game of cards; but Nidderdale would not play because he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was
offended with Dolly Longestaffe; and Miles Grendall was away in the
country,--a fugitive from the face of Melmotte, and Carbury was in
hiding at home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) countenance from top to bottom supported
by plasters, and Montague in these days never went to the club. At
the present moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was again in Liverpool, having been summoned
thither by Mr. Ramsbottom. <div class="bookquote">``By George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ramsbottom</b></font>) filled
another pipe and ordered more brandy and water, <div class="bookquote">``I think everything
is going to come to an end. I do indeed. I never heard of such a
thing before as a man being done in this way. And then Vossner has
gone off, and it seems everybody is to pay just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) says they
owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>). And now one can't even get up a game of cards. I feel as
though there were no good in hoping that things would ever come right
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The opinion of the club was a good deal divided as to the matter
in dispute between Lord Nidderdale and Dolly Longestaffe. It was
admitted by some to be <div class="bookquote">``very fishy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>If Melmotte were so great a man
why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pay the money, and why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) have mortgaged the
property before it was really his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own? But the majority of the men
thought that Dolly was wrong. As to the signature of the letter,
Dolly was a man who would naturally be quite unable to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had and what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not signed. And then, even into the Beargarden
there had filtered, through the outer world, a feeling that people
were not now bound to be so punctilious in the paying of money as
they were a few years since. No doubt it suited Melmotte to make use
of the money, and therefore,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had succeeded in getting the
property into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did make use of it. But it would be
forthcoming sooner or later! In this way of looking at the matter the
Beargarden followed the world at large. The world at large, in spite
of the terrible falling-off at the Emperor of China's dinner, in
spite of all the rumours, in spite of the ruinous depreciation of
the Mexican Railway stock, and of the undoubted fact that Dolly
Longestaffe had not received his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) money, was inclined to think that
Melmotte would <div class="bookquote">``pull through.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXV.

<p/>IN BRUTON STREET.


<p/>Mr. Squercum all this time was in a perfect fever of hard work and
anxiety. It may be said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had been quite sharp enough
to perceive the whole truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) did really know it all,--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) could
prove that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) enquiries in the city
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had convinced himself that, whatever wealth Melmotte might
have had twelve months ago, there was not enough of it left at
present to cover the liabilities. Squercum was quite sure that
Melmotte was not a falling, but a fallen star,--perhaps not giving
sufficient credence to the recuperative powers of modern commerce.
Squercum told a certain stockbroker in the City, who was his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
specially confidential friend, that Melmotte was a <div class="bookquote">``gone coon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>The
stockbroker made also some few enquiries, and on that evening agreed
with Squercum that Melmotte was a <div class="bookquote">``gone coon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>If such were the
case it would positively be the making of Squercum if it could be
so managed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should appear as the destroying angel of this
offensive dragon. So Squercum raged among the Bideawhiles, who were
unable altogether to shut their doors against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). They could not
dare to bid defiance to Squercum,--feeling that they had themselves
blundered, and feeling also that they must be careful not to seem to
screen a fault by a falsehood. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you give it up about the
letter having been signed by my client,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>said Squercum to the elder
of the two younger Bideawhiles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I give up nothing and I assert nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the superior attorney.
<div class="bookquote">``Whether the letter be genuine or not we had no reason to believe it
to be otherwise. The young gentleman's signature is never very plain,
and this one is about as like any other as that other would be like
the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you let me look at it again, Mr. Bideawhile?''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>Then the letter
which had been very often inspected during the last ten days was
handed to Mr. Squercum. <div class="bookquote">``It's a stiff resemblance;--such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) never
could have written had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) tried it ever so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not, Mr. Squercum. We are not generally on the lookout for
forgeries in letters from our clients or our clients' sons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, Mr. Bideawhile. But then Mr. Longestaffe had already told
you that his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son would not sign the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is one to know when and how and why a young man like that will
change his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purpose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, Mr. Bideawhile. But you see after such a declaration as
that on the part of my client's father, the letter,--which is in
itself a little irregular perhaps--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that it's irregular at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--it didn't reach you in a very confirmatory manner. We'll just
say that. What Mr. Longestaffe can have been at to wish to give up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) title-deeds without getting anything for them--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Mr. Squercum, but that's between Mr. Longestaffe and us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so;--but as Mr. Longestaffe and you have jeopardised my
client's property it is natural that I should make a few remarks. I
think you'd have made a few remarks yourself, Mr. Bideawhile, if the
case had been reversed. I shall bring the matter before the Lord
Mayor, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>To this Mr. Bideawhile said not a word. <div class="bookquote">``And I
think I understand you now that you do not intend to insist on the
signature as being genuine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say nothing about it, Mr. Squercum. I think you'll find it very
hard to prove that it's not genuine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My client's oath, Mr. Bideawhile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid your client is not always very clear as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by that, Mr. Bideawhile. I fancy that if
I were to speak in that way of your client you would be very angry
with me. Besides, what does it all amount to? Will the old gentleman
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gave the letter into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) son's hands, so that, even if
such a freak should have come into my client's head, he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) could have
signed it and sent it off? If I understand, Mr. Longestaffe says that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) locked the letter up in a drawer in the very room which Melmotte
occupied, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) afterwards found the drawer open. It won't, I
suppose, be alleged that my client knew so little what he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) was about
that he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) broke open the drawer in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) might get at the
letter. Look at it whichever way you will, he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) did not sign it, Mr.
Bideawhile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) did. All I say is that we had fair ground for
supposing that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) letter. I really don't know that I can say
anything more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that we are to a certain degree in the same boat together in
this matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't admit even that, Mr. Squercum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The difference being that your client by his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) fault has jeopardised
his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) own interests and those of my client, while my client has not
been in fault at all. I shall bring the matter forward before the
Lord Mayor to-morrow, and as at present advised shall ask for an
investigation with reference to a charge of fraud. I presume you will
be served with a subpoena to bring the letter into court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so you may be sure that we shall produce it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>Then Mr. Squercum
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) leave and went straight away to Mr. Bumby, a barrister well
known in the City. The game was too powerful to be hunted down by Mr.
Squercum's unassisted hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had already seen Mr. Bumby on the
matter more than once. Mr. Bumby was inclined to doubt whether it
might not be better to get the money, or some guarantee for the
money. Mr. Bumby thought that if a bill at three months could be had
for Dolly's share of the property it might be expedient to take it.
Mr. Squercum suggested that the property itself might be recovered,
no genuine sale having been made. Mr. Bumby shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumby</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Title-deeds give possession, Mr. Squercum. You don't suppose that
the company which has lent money to Melmotte on the title-deeds would
have to lose it. Take the bill; and if it is dishonoured run your
chance of what you'll get out of the property. There must be assets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every rap will have been made over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Squercum.

<p/>This took place on the Monday, the day on which Melmotte had offered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) full confidence to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) proposed son-in-law. On the following
Wednesday three gentlemen met together in the study in the house
in Bruton Street from which it was supposed that the letter had
been abstracted. There were Mr. Longestaffe, the father, Dolly
Longestaffe, and Mr. Bideawhile. The house was still in Melmotte's
possession, and Melmotte and Mr. Longestaffe were no longer on
friendly terms. Direct application for permission to have this
meeting in this place had been formally made to Mr. Melmotte, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had complied. The meeting took place at eleven o'clock--a terribly
early hour. Dolly had at first hesitated as to placing himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
thought between the fire of two enemies, and Mr. Squercum had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) that as the matter would probably soon be made public, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) could
not judiciously refuse to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) father and the old family lawyer.
Therefore Dolly had attended, at great personal inconvenience to
himself. <div class="bookquote">``By George, it's hardly worth having if one is to take all
this trouble about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Dolly had said to Lord Grasslough, with whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had fraternised since the quarrel with Nidderdale. Dolly entered
the room last, and at that time neither Mr. Longestaffe nor Mr.
Bideawhile had touched the drawer, or even the table, in which the
letter had been deposited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Longestaffe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bideawhile, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you will show
us where you think you put the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Since the matter has been discussed
the whole thing has come back upon my memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never signed it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>)
pockets and interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody says you did, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>rejoined the father with an angry voice.
<div class="bookquote">``If you will condescend to listen we may perhaps arrive at the
truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But somebody has said that I did. I've been told that Mr. Bideawhile
says so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Longestaffe; no. We have never said so. We have only said
that we had no reason for supposing the letter to be other than
genuine. We have never gone beyond that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing on earth would have made me sign it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``Why
should I have given my property up before I got my money? I never
heard such a thing in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father</b></font>)</div><p/>The father looked up at the lawyer and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, testifying as
to the hopelessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son's obstinacy. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Longestaffe,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>continued the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``let us see where you put the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the father very slowly, and with much dignity of deportment,
opened the drawer,--the second drawer from the top, and took from it
a bundle of papers very carefully folded and docketed. <div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the letter was not placed in the envelope but on the top of it,
and the two were the two first documents in the bundle.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on
to say that as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew no other paper had been taken away. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was quite certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had left the drawer locked. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very
particular in regard to that particular drawer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remembered
that about this time Mr. Melmotte had been in the room with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had opened it, and,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was certain,--had locked it again. At
that special time there had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, considerable intimacy
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and Melmotte. It was then that Mr. Melmotte had offered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) a seat at the Board of the Mexican railway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) picked the lock, and stole the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.
<div class="bookquote">``It's as plain as a pike-staff. It's clear enough to hang any man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that it falls short of evidence, however strong and just
may be the suspicion induced,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer. <div class="bookquote">``Your father for a
time was not quite certain about the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought that I had signed it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite certain now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>rejoined the father angrily. <div class="bookquote">``A man has to
collect his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can be sure of anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thinking you know how it would go to a jury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I want to know is how we are to get the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.
<div class="bookquote">``I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hung,--of course; but I'd sooner have the
money. Squercum says--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Adolphus, we don't want to know here what Mr. Squercum says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why what Mr. Squercum says shouldn't be as good as what
Mr. Bideawhile says. Of course Squercum doesn't sound very
aristocratic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite as much so as Bideawhile, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; Squercum isn't aristocratic, and Fetter Lane is a good deal
lower than Lincoln's Inn. Nevertheless Squercum may know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>)'s
about. It was Squercum who was first down upon Melmotte in this
matter, and if it wasn't for Squercum we shouldn't know as much about
it as we do at present.''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>Squercum's name was odious to the elder
Longestaffe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) believed, probably without much reason, that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
family troubles came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) from Squercum, thinking that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) son
would have left his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) affairs in the hands of the old Slows and the
old Bideawhiles, money would never have been scarce with him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>), and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) would not have made this terrible blunder about the Pickering
property. And the sound of Squercum, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) son knew, was horrid to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) hummed and hawed, and fumed and fretted about the room,
shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) head and frowning. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) son looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) as though quite
astonished at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) displeasure. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing more to be done here,
sir, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bideawhile. <div class="bookquote">``It may be that I shall have
to instruct counsel, and I thought it well that I should see in the
presence of both of you exactly how the thing stood. You speak so
positively, Mr. Longestaffe, that there can be no doubt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now perhaps you had better lock the drawer in our presence. Stop
a moment--I might as well see whether there is any sign of violence
having been used.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>So saying Mr. Bideawhile knelt down in front of
the table and began to examine the lock. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) did very carefully
and satisfied himself that there was <div class="bookquote">``no sign of violence.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whoever
has done it, did it very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>said Bideawhile.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``I might as well see whether there is any sign

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course Melmotte did it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly Longestaffe standing
immediately over Bideawhile's shoulder.

<p/>At that moment there was a knock at the door,--a very distinct, and,
we may say, a formal knock. There are those who knock and immediately
enter without waiting for the sanction asked. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) who knocked done
so on this occasion Mr. Bideawhile would have been found still on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) knees, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) nose down to the level of the keyhole. But the
intruder did not intrude rapidly, and the lawyer jumped on to his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
feet, almost upsetting Dolly with the effort. There was a pause,
during which Mr. Bideawhile moved away from the table,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) might
have done had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) been picking a lock;--and then Mr. Longestaffe bade
the stranger come in with a sepulchral voice. The door was opened,
and Mr. Melmotte appeared.

<p/>Now Mr. Melmotte's presence certainly had not been expected. It was
known that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) habit to be in the City at this hour. It was
known also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was well aware that this meeting was to be held
in this room at this special hour,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might well have surmised
with what view. There was now declared hostility between both the
Longestaffes and Mr. Melmotte, and it certainly was supposed by all
the gentlemen concerned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would not have put himself out of the
way to meet them on this occasion. <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you
think that I am intruding at the present moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No one said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
did not think so. The elder Longestaffe simply bowed very coldly. Mr.
Bideawhile stood upright and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) thumbs into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) waistcoat
pockets. Dolly, who at first forgot to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) hat off, whistled a
bar, and then turned a pirouette on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) heel. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) mode of
expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) thorough surprise at the appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) debtor. <div class="bookquote">``I
fear that you do think I am intruding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, <div class="bookquote">``but I trust
that what I have to say will be held to excuse me. I see, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
said, turning to Mr. Longestaffe, and glancing at the still open
drawer, <div class="bookquote">``that you have been examining your desk. I hope that you will
be more careful in locking it than you were when you left it before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The drawer was locked when I left it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe. <div class="bookquote">``I make
no deductions and draw no conclusions, but the drawer was locked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I should say it must have been locked when you returned to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I found it open. I make no deductions and draw no
conclusions,--but I left it locked and I found it open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should make a deduction and draw a conclusion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly; <div class="bookquote">``and
that would be that somebody else had opened it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This can answer no purpose at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>said Bideawhile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was but a chance remark,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``I did not come here
out of the City at very great personal inconvenience to myself to
squabble about the lock of the drawer. As I was informed that you
three gentlemen would be here together, I thought the opportunity
a suitable one for meeting you and making you an offer about this
unfortunate business.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) paused a moment; but neither of the three
spoke. It did occur to Dolly to ask them to wait while he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should
fetch Squercum; but on second thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) reflected that a great deal
of trouble would have to be taken, and probably for no good. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Bideawhile, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>suggested Melmotte; and the lawyer bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
head. <div class="bookquote">``If I remember rightly I wrote to you offering to pay the money
due to your clients--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Squercum is my lawyer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will make no difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes a deal of difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wrote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>continued Melmotte, <div class="bookquote">``offering my bills at three and six
months' date.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They couldn't be accepted, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have allowed interest. I never have had my bills refused
before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be aware, Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``that the sale of
a property is not like an ordinary mercantile transaction in which
bills are customarily given and taken. The understanding was that
money should be paid in the usual way. And when we learned, as we did
learn, that the property had been at once mortgaged by you, of course
we became,--well, I think I may be justified in saying more than
suspicious. It was a most,--most--unusual proceeding. You say you
have another offer to make, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I have been short of money. I have had enemies whose
business it has been for some time past to run down my credit, and,
with my credit, has fallen the value of stocks in which it has been
known that I have been largely interested. I tell you the truth
openly. When I purchased Pickering I had no idea that the payment of
such a sum of money could inconvenience me in the least. When the
time came at which I should pay it, stocks were so depreciated that
it was impossible to sell. Very hostile proceedings are threatened
against me now. Accusations are made, false as hell,'' (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Melmotte
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) spoke raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) voice and looked round the room,--<div class="bookquote">``but which
at the present crisis may do me most cruel damage. I have come to
say that, if you will undertake to stop proceedings which have been
commenced in the City, I will have fifty thousand pounds,--which is
the amount due to these two gentlemen,--ready for payment on Friday
at noon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have taken no proceedings as yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>said Bideawhile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Squercum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>says Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>continued Melmotte addressing Dolly, <div class="bookquote">``let me assure
you that if these proceedings are stayed the money will be
forthcoming;--but if not, I cannot produce the money. I little
thought two months ago that I should ever have to make such a
statement in reference to such a sum as fifty thousand pounds. But
so it is. To raise that money by Friday, I shall have to cripple
my resources frightfully. It will be done at a terrible cost. But
what Mr. Bideawhile says is true. I have no right to suppose that
the purchase of this property should be looked upon as an ordinary
commercial transaction. The money should have been paid,--and, if
you will now take my word, the money shall be paid. But this cannot
be done if I am made to appear before the Lord Mayor to-morrow. The
accusations brought against me are damnably false. I do not know
with whom they have originated. Whoever did originate them, they are
damnably false. But unfortunately, false as they are, in the present
crisis, they may be ruinous to me. Now gentlemen, perhaps you will
give me an answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>Both the father and the lawyer looked at Dolly. Dolly was in truth
the accuser through the mouthpiece of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) attorney Squercum. It was
at Dolly's instance that these proceedings were being taken. <div class="bookquote">``I, on
behalf of my client,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bideawhile, <div class="bookquote">``will consent to wait till
Friday at noon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I presume, Adolphus, that you will say as much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said the elder
Longestaffe.

<p/>Dolly Longestaffe was certainly not an impressionable person, but
Melmotte's eloquence had moved even him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). It was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was sorry
for the man, but that at the present moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been absolutely sure that Melmotte had forged his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) name or
caused it to be forged,--and did not now go so far into the matter
as to abandon that conviction,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been talked into crediting
the reasons given for Melmotte's temporary distress, and also into
a belief that the money would be paid on Friday. Something of
the effect which Melmotte's false confessions had had upon Lord
Nidderdale, they now also had on Dolly Longestaffe. <div class="bookquote">``I'll ask
Squercum, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course Mr. Squercum will act as you instruct him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>said
Bideawhile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask Squercum. I'll go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) at once. I can't do any more than
that. And upon my word, Mr. Melmotte, you've given me a great deal of
trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Melmotte with a smile apologized. Then it was settled that they three
should meet in that very room on Friday at noon, and that the payment
should then be made,--Dolly stipulating that as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) father would be
attended by Bideawhile, so would he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) be attended by Squercum. To this
Mr. Longestaffe senior yielded with a very bad grace.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXVI.

<p/>HETTA AND HER LOVER.


<p/>Lady Carbury was at this time so miserable in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found herself unable to be active as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would otherwise have
been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) endeavours to separate Paul Montague and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter.
Roger had come up to town and given his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) opinion, very freely at any
rate with regard to Sir Felix. But Roger had immediately returned to
Suffolk, and the poor mother in want of assistance and consolation
turned naturally to Mr. Broune, who came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for a few minutes
almost every evening. It had now become almost a part of Mr. Broune's
life to see Lady Carbury once in the day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) of the two
propositions which Roger had made: first, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
residence in some second-rate French or German town, and that Sir
Felix should be made to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>); and, secondly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) should
take possession of Carbury manor for six months. <div class="bookquote">``And where would Mr.
Carbury go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Broune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)'s so good that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) doesn't care what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) does with himself.
There's a cottage on the place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) says, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would move to.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Broune shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) head. Mr. Broune did not think that an offer so
quixotically generous as this should be accepted. As to the German or
French town, Mr. Broune said that the plan was no doubt feasible, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) doubted whether the thing to be achieved was worth the terrible
sacrifice demanded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was inclined to think that Sir Felix should go
to the colonies. <div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might drink himself to death,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Carbury, who now had no secrets from Mr. Broune. Sir Felix in the
mean time was still in the doctor's hands up-stairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had no doubt
been very severely thrashed, but there was not in truth very much
ailing him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) beyond the cuts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was, however, at the
present moment better satisfied to be an invalid than to have to come
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) room and to meet the world. <div class="bookquote">``As to Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Broune, <div class="bookquote">``they say now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is in some terrible mess which will
ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and all who have trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible to understand it all. Melmotte was to have been
summoned before the Lord Mayor to-day on some charge of fraud;--but
it was postponed. And I was told this morning that Nidderdale still
means to marry the girl. I don't think anybody knows the truth
about it. We shall hold our tongue about him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) till we really do know
something.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The <div class="bookquote">``we''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>of whom Mr. Broune spoke was, of course, the
<div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div><p/>But in all this there was nothing about Hetta. Hetta, however,
thought very much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) own condition, and found herself driven to
take some special step by the receipt of two letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) lover,
written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) from Liverpool. They had never met since she (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had
confessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) love to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). The first letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) did not at once
answer, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was at that moment waiting to hear what Roger
Carbury would say about Mrs. Hurtle. Roger Carbury had spoken,
leaving a conviction on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mind that Mrs. Hurtle was by no means
a fiction,--but indeed a fact very injurious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) happiness. Then
Paul's second love-letter had come, full of joy, and love, and
contentment,--with not a word in it which seemed to have been in the
slightest degree influenced by the existence of a Mrs. Hurtle. Had
there been no Mrs. Hurtle, the letter would have been all that Hetta
could have desired; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could have answered it, unless forbidden
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother, with all a girl's usual enthusiastic affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
chosen lord. But it was impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) should now answer it in
that strain;--and it was equally impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) should leave
such letters unanswered. Roger had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``ask himself;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) now found herself constrained to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) either come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) and
answer the question, or, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thought it better, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) some
written account of Mrs. Hurtle,--so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) might know who the lady
was, and whether the lady's condition did in any way interfere with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own happiness. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) wrote to Paul, as follows:--


<p/>Welbeck Street,
16th July, 18--.

<p/>MY DEAR PAUL.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) found that after that which had passed between them she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) could not
call him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``My dear Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. Montague,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and that it must
either be <div class="bookquote">``Sir''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``My dear Paul.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>),--very dear;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not been as yet convicted of any conduct
bad enough to force her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as an outcast. Had there been no
Mrs. Hurtle he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Dearest Paul,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
choice, and so commenced.

<p/>MY DEAR PAUL,

<p/>A strange report has come round to me about a lady called
Mrs. Hurtle. I have been told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is an American lady
living in London, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is engaged to be your wife.
I cannot believe this. It is too horrid to be true. But
I fear,--I fear there is something true that will be very
very sad for me to hear. It was from my brother I first
heard it,--who was of course bound to tell me anything he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
knew. I have talked to mamma about it, and to my cousin
Roger. I am sure Roger knows it all;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) will not tell
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``Ask himself.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And so I ask you. Of course I
can write about nothing else till I have heard about this.
I am sure I need not tell you that it has made me very
unhappy. If you cannot come and see me at once, you had
better write. I have told mamma about this letter.

<p/>Then came the difficulty of the signature, with the declaration
which must naturally be attached to it. After some hesitation she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
subscribed herself,

<p/>Your affectionate friend,

<p/>HENRIETTA CARBURY.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most affectionately your own Hetta''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>would have been the form in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>CARBURY</b></font>) would have wished to finish the first letter she (<font color='blue'><b>CARBURY</b></font>) had ever
written to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/>Paul received it at Liverpool on the Wednesday morning, and on the
Wednesday evening he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was in Welbeck Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been quite aware
that it had been incumbent on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) the whole history of
Mrs. Hurtle. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had meant to keep back--almost nothing. But it had
been impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to do so on that one occasion on which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
had pleaded his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) successfully. Let any reader who is
intelligent in such matters say whether it would have been possible
for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) then to have commenced the story of Mrs. Hurtle and to have
told it to the bitter end. Such a story must be postponed for a
second or a third interview. Or it may, indeed, be communicated
by letter. When Paul was called away to Liverpool he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did consider
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should write the story. But there are many reasons strong
against such written communications. A man may desire that the woman
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves should hear the record of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) folly,--so that, in after
days, there may be nothing to be detected; so that, should the Mrs.
Hurtle of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life at any time intrude upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happiness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may
with a clear brow and undaunted heart say to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beloved one,--<div class="bookquote">``Ah,
this is the trouble of which I spoke to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
beloved one will be in one cause together. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hardly wishes to
supply his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beloved one with a written record of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) folly. And then
who does not know how much tenderness a man may show to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
faults by the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, by half-spoken sentences, and by
an admixture of words of love for the lady who has filled up the
vacant space once occupied by the Mrs. Hurtle of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) romance? But the
written record must go through from beginning to end, self-accusing,
thoroughly perspicuous, with no sweet, soft falsehoods hidden under
the half-expressed truth. The soft falsehoods which would be sweet as
the scent of violets in a personal interview, would stand in danger
of being denounced as deceit added to deceit, if sent in a letter. I
think therefore that Paul Montague did quite right in hurrying up to
London.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked for Miss Carbury, and when told that Miss Henrietta was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name up and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would wait in the
dining-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thoroughly made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to this course. They
should know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come at once; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not, if it could
be helped, make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) statement in the presence of Lady Carbury. Then,
up-stairs, there was a little discussion. Hetta pleaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) right to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had done what Roger had advised, and had done it
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother's consent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother might be sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would
not again accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lover till this story of Mrs. Hurtle had been
sifted to the very bottom. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) must herself hear what her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) lover
had to say for himself. Felix was at the time in the drawing-room
and suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should go down and see Paul Montague on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
sister's behalf;--but his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mother looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) with scorn, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
sister quietly said that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would rather see Mr. Montague herself.
Felix had been so cowed by circumstances that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did not say another
word, and Hetta left the room alone.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) entered the parlour Paul stept forward to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
arms. That was a matter of course. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) knew it would be so, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had prepared herself for it. <div class="bookquote">``Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``let me hear about all
this--first.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sat down at some distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) found
himself compelled to seat himself at some little distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you have heard of Mrs. Hurtle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said, with a faint attempt
at a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--Felix told me, and Roger evidently had heard about her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; Roger Carbury has heard about her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) from the beginning;--knows
the whole history almost as well as I know it myself. I don't think
your brother is as well informed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. But--isn't it a story that--concerns me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly it so far concerns you, Hetta, that you ought to know it.
And I trust you will believe that it was my intention to tell it
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will believe anything that you will tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, I don't think that you will quarrel with me when you know
all. I was engaged to marry Mrs. Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) a widow?'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did not answer this at once. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
must be a widow if you were going to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is a widow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was divorced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Paul! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is an American?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Montague was desirous of telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own story, and did not wish to
be interrogated. <div class="bookquote">``If you will allow me I will tell it you all from
beginning to end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly. But I suppose you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). If you meant to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) you must have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>There was a frown upon Hetta's brow and
a tone of anger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) voice which made Paul uneasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) once; but I will tell you all.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did
tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) story, with a repetition of which the reader need not be
detained. Hetta listened with fair attention,--not interrupting very
often, though when she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did interrupt, the little words which she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
spoke were bitter enough. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heard the story of the long journey
across the American continent, of the ocean journey before the end of
which Paul had promised to make this woman his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) been
divorced then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>asked Hetta,--<div class="bookquote">``because I believe they get themselves
divorced just when they like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Simple as the question was he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) could
not answer it. <div class="bookquote">``I could only know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) story. Then Mrs. Hurtle had gone on to Paris, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) reached Carbury, had revealed everything to Roger.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you give her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) up then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>demanded Hetta with stern severity.
No,--not then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had gone back to San Francisco, and,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had not
intended to say that the engagement had been renewed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was
forced to acknowledge that it had not been broken off. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had
written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) second return to England,--and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
appeared in London at Mrs. Pipkin's lodgings in Islington. <div class="bookquote">``I can
hardly tell you how terrible that was to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for I had by
that time become quite aware that my happiness must depend upon you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) tried the gentle, soft falsehoods that should have been as sweet
as violets. Perhaps they were sweet. It is odd how stern a girl can
be, while her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart is almost breaking with love. Hetta was very
stern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Felix says you took her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to Lowestoft,--quite the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>Montague had intended to tell all,--almost all. There was a something
about the journey to Lowestoft which it would be impossible to make
Hetta understand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) thought that that might be omitted. <div class="bookquote">``It was
on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh;--on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) health. And did you go to the play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that for her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)--health?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Hetta, do not speak to me like that! Cannot you understand that
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) came here, following me, I could not desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot understand why you deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta. <div class="bookquote">``You
say you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), and you promised to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). It seems horrid to
me to marry a divorced woman,--a woman who just says that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
divorced. But that is because I don't understand American ways. And I
am sure you must have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) when you took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the theatre, and
down to Lowestoft,--for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) health. That was only a week ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was nearly three weeks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul in despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh;--nearly three weeks! That is not such a very long time for a
gentleman to change his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind on such a matter. You were engaged to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), not three weeks ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Hetta, I was not engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought you were when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went to Lowestoft with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted then to force me to--to--to--. Oh, Hetta, it is so hard

you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you be false to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? Why should I step in and crush
all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hopes? I can understand that Roger should think badly of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was--divorced. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would. But an engagement is
an engagement. You had better go back to Mrs. Hurtle and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
that you are quite ready to keep your promise.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) knows now that it is all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you will be able to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to reconsider it. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) came all the way here from San Francisco after you, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
asked you to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to the theatre, and to Lowestoft--because of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) health, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) must be very much attached to you. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is waiting
here,--no doubt on purpose for you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is a very old friend,--very
old,--and you ought not to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) unkindly. Good bye, Mr.
Montague. I think you had better lose no time in going--back to Mrs.
Hurtle.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>All this she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said with sundry little impedimentary gurgles
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) throat, but without a tear and without any sign of tenderness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to tell me, Hetta, that you are going to quarrel with
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about quarrelling. I don't wish to quarrel with any
one. But of course we can't be friends when you have married--Mrs.
Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing on earth would induce me to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I cannot say anything about that. When they told me this
story I did not believe them. No; I hardly believed Roger when,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
would not tell it for he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was too kind,--but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would not
contradict it. It seemed to be almost impossible that you should
have come to me just at the very same moment. For, after all, Mr.
Montague, nearly three weeks is a very short time. That trip to
Lowestoft couldn't have been much above a week before you came to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; of course not;--nothing to you. I think I will go away now,
Mr. Montague. It was very good of you to come and tell me all. It
makes it so much easier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say that--you are going to--throw me over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to throw Mrs. Hurtle over. Good bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hetta!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I will not have you lay your hand upon me. Good night, Mr.
Montague.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>).

<p/>Paul Montague was beside himself with dismay as he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) left the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
had never allowed himself for a moment to believe that this affair
of Mrs. Hurtle would really separate him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) from Hetta Carbury. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
could only really know it all, there could be no such result. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
had been true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) from the first moment in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>),
never swerving from his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) love. It was to be supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had loved
some woman before; but, as the world goes, that would not, could
not, affect her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anger was founded on the presence of Mrs.
Hurtle in London,--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) would have given half his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) possessions to
have prevented. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did come, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) to have refused to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)? Would Hetta have wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) to be cold and cruel like that? No
doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had behaved badly to Mrs. Hurtle;--but that trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had
overcome. And now Hetta was quarrelling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) certainly
had never behaved badly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was almost angry with Hetta as he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) walked home. Everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
could do he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). For her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) sake he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had quarrelled with
Roger Carbury. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) sake,--in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might be effectually
free from Mrs. Hurtle,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had determined to endure the spring of the
wild cat. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) sake,--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) told himself,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been content
to abide by that odious railway company, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might if
possible preserve an income on which to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that they must part,--and that only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not been
cruelly indifferent to the unfortunate woman who had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
from America. There was no logic in it, no reason,--and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
thought, very little heart. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to throw Mrs. Hurtle
over,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had said. Why should Mrs. Hurtle be anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)?
Surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) might have left Mrs. Hurtle to fight her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own battles.
But they were all against him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). Roger Carbury, Lady Carbury, and Sir
Felix; and the end of it would be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would be forced into
marriage with a man almost old enough to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father! She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could not
ever really have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). That was the truth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) must be incapable
of such love as was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own for her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>). True love always forgives.
And here there was really so very little to forgive! Such were his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
thoughts as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went to bed that night. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) probably omitted to
ask himself whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) very readily had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had been living <div class="bookquote">``nearly three weeks ago''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in close
intercourse with another lover of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had hitherto never even
heard the name. But then,--as all the world knows,--there is a wide
difference between young men and young women!

<p/>Hetta, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) lover, went up at once to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own room. Thither she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) was soon followed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mother, whose
anxious ear had heard the closing of the front door. <div class="bookquote">``Well; what
has he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Carbury. Hetta was in tears,--or very
nigh to tears,--struggling to repress them, and struggling almost
successfully. <div class="bookquote">``You have found that what we told you about that woman
was all true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough of it was true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, who, angry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lover, was not on that account less angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother for
disturbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) bliss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by that, Hetta? Had you not better speak to me
openly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, mamma, that enough was true. I do not know how to speak more
openly. I need not go into all the miserable story of the woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
is like other men, I suppose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has entangled himself with some
abominable creature and then when he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) is tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
has nothing to do but to say so,--and to begin with somebody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Roger Carbury is very different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, you will make me ill if you go on like that. It seems to
me that you do not understand in the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) is not like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least. Of course I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) is not in the least like

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) can be trusted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that if you would give yourself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), there would be no cause
for any alarm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta jumping up, <div class="bookquote">``how can you talk to me in that way?
As soon as one man doesn't suit, I am to give myself to another! Oh,
mamma, how can you propose it? Nothing on earth will ever induce me
to be more to Roger Carbury than I am now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That it is all over?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta made no reply. <div class="bookquote">``Hetta, I have a right to

<p/>CHAPTER LXXVII.

<p/>ANOTHER SCENE IN BRUTON STREET.


<p/>When Mr. Melmotte made his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) promise to Mr. Longestaffe and to Dolly,
in the presence of Mr. Bideawhile, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) would, on the next day but
one, pay to them a sum of fifty thousand pounds, thereby completing,
satisfactorily as far as they were concerned, the purchase of the
Pickering property, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) intended to be as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) word. The reader
knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had resolved to face the Longestaffe difficulty,--that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had resolved that at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) would not get out of it by
sacrificing the property to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had looked forward as a safe
haven when storms should come. But, day by day, every resolution
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) made was forced to undergo some change. Latterly he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) had been
intent on purchasing a noble son-in-law with this money,--still
trusting to the chapter of chances for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) future escape from the
Longestaffe and other difficulties. But Squercum had been very hard
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>); and in connexion with this accusation as to the Pickering
property, there was another, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) would be forced to face also,
respecting certain property in the East of London, with which the
reader need not much trouble himself specially, but in reference to
which it was stated that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had induced a foolish old gentleman to
consent to accept railway shares in lieu of money. The old gentleman
had died during the transaction, and it was asserted that the old
gentleman's letter was hardly genuine. Melmotte had certainly raised
between twenty and thirty thousand pounds on the property, and had
made payments for it in stock which was now worth--almost nothing at
all. Melmotte thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might face this matter successfully
if the matter came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) single-handed;--but in regard to the
Longestaffes he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) considered that now, at this last moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
better pay for Pickering.

<p/>The property from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) intended to raise the necessary funds was
really his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) own. There could be no doubt about that. It had never been
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) intention to make it over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) daughter. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) had placed it
in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) had done so simply for security,--feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>)
control over his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) only daughter would be perfect and free from danger.
No girl apparently less likely to take it into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head to defraud
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father could have crept quietly about a father's house. Nor did
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now think that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would disobey him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) when the matter was explained
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Heavens and earth! That he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should be robbed by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own
child,--robbed openly, shamefully, with brazen audacity! It was
impossible. But still he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had felt the necessity of going about this
business with some little care. It might be that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would disobey
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) simply sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to affix her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) signature
here and there. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought much about it and considered that it would
be wise that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife should be present on the occasion, and that
a full explanation should be given to Marie, by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) might be
made to understand that the money had in no sense become her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own. So
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave instructions to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) started into the city that
morning; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) returned, for the sake of making his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) offer to
the Longestaffes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the deeds which it would be
necessary that Marie should sign, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brought also Mr. Croll, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
clerk, that Mr. Croll might witness the signature.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) left the Longestaffes and Mr. Bideawhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) went at once to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) wife's room. <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will send for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? It is not very easy to frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
Melmotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is changed since these young men have been so much
about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not do as I bid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Bid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come
now.''  (<font color='red'><b>French</b></font>)</div>This was said in French. Then Madame Melmotte left the room,
and Melmotte arranged a lot of papers in order upon a table. Having
done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) called to Croll, who was standing on the landing-place,
and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) to seat himself in the back drawing-room till he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) should
be called. Melmotte then stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) back to the fire-place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
wife's sitting-room, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pockets, contemplating
what might be the incidents of the coming interview. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be very
gracious,--affectionate if it were possible,--and, above all things,
explanatory. But, by heavens, if there were continued opposition
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) demand,--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) just demand,--if this girl should dare to
insist upon exercising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) power to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would not then be
affectionate,--nor gracious! There was some little delay in the
coming of the two women, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was already beginning to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
temper when Marie followed Madame Melmotte into the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at once
swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) rising anger--with an effort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would put a constraint
upon himself. The affection and the graciousness should be all
there,--as long as they might secure the purpose in hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``I spoke to you the other day about some property
which for certain purposes was placed in your name just as we were
leaving Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were such a child then,--I mean when we left Paris,--that I
could hardly explain to you the purpose of what I did.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I understood
it, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better listen to me, my dear. I don't think you did quite
understand it. It would have been very odd if you had, as I never
explained it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wanted to keep it from going away if you got into trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>This was so true that Melmotte did not know how at the moment to
contradict the assertion. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not intended to talk of the
possibility of trouble. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to lay aside a large sum of money
which should not be liable to the ordinary fluctuations of commercial
enterprise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that nobody could get at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a little too quick, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marie, why can't you let your papa speak?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Madame Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But of course, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>continued Melmotte, <div class="bookquote">``I had no idea of
putting the money beyond my own reach. Such a transaction is very
common; and in such cases a man naturally uses the name of some one
who is very near and dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can
put full confidence. And it is customary to choose a young person, as
there will then be less danger of the accident of death. It was for
these reasons, which I am sure that you will understand, that I chose
you. Of course the property remained exclusively my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is really mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miss; it was never yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, almost bursting out
into anger, but restraining himself. <div class="bookquote">``How could it become yours,
Marie? Did I ever make you a gift of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I know that it did become mine,--legally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By a quibble of law,--yes; but not so as to give you any right to
it. I always draw the income.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I could stop that, papa,--and if I were married, of course it
would be stopped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, quick as a flash of lightning, another idea occurred to
Melmotte, who feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) already began to see that this child of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might be stiff-necked. <div class="bookquote">``As we are thinking of your marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``it is necessary that a change should be made. Settlements must
be drawn for the satisfaction of Lord Nidderdale and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father. The
old Marquis is rather hard upon me, but the marriage is so splendid
that I have consented. You must now sign these papers in four or
five places. Mr. Croll is here, in the next room, to witness your
signature, and I will call him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a moment, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should we wait?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I will sign them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not sign them? You can't really suppose that the property is
your own. You could not even get it if you did think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how that may be; but I had rather not sign them. If I
am to be married, I ought not to sign anything except what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) tells
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has no authority over you yet. I have authority over you. Marie,
do not give more trouble. I am very much pressed for time. Let me
call in Mr. Croll.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said.

<p/>Then came across his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brow that look which had probably first induced
Marie to declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would endure to be <div class="bookquote">``cut to pieces,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>rather
than to yield in this or that direction. The lower jaw squared
itself, and the teeth became set, and the nostrils of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) nose became
extended,--and Marie began to prepare herself to be <div class="bookquote">``cut to pieces.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) reminded himself that there was another game which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
proposed to play before he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) resorted to anger and violence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) how much depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) compliance. Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) relaxed
the frown,--as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew how, and softened his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and turned again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure, Marie, that you will
not refuse to do this when I explain to you its importance to me. I
must have that property for use in the city to-morrow, or--I shall
be ruined.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The statement was very short, but the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
made it was not without effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>shrieked his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true. These harpies have so beset me about the election that
they have lowered the price of every stock in which I am concerned,
and have brought the Mexican Railway so low that they cannot be sold
at all. I don't like bringing my troubles home from the city; but on
this occasion I cannot help it. The sum locked up here is very large,
and I am compelled to use it. In point of fact it is necessary to
save us from destruction.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said, very slowly, and with the
utmost solemnity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you told me just now you wanted it because I was going to be
married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>rejoined Marie.

<p/>A liar has many points in his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) favour,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) has this against him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>),
that unless he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) devote more time to the management of his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) lies than
life will generally allow, he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) cannot make them tally. Melmotte was
thrown back for a moment, and almost felt that the time for violence
had come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) longed to be at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might shake the wickedness
and the folly, and the ingratitude out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) once more
condescended to argue and to explain. <div class="bookquote">``I think you misunderstood me,
Marie. I meant you to understand that settlements must be made, and
that of course I must get my own property back into my own hands
before anything of that kind can be done. I tell you once more, my
dear, that if you do not do as I bid you, so that I may use that
property the first thing to-morrow, we are all ruined. Everything
will be gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This can't be gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head at the papers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marie,--do you wish to see me disgraced and ruined? I have done a
great deal for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You turned away the only person I ever cared for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marie, how can you be so wicked? Do as your papa bids you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said
Madame Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) does not care who is ruined, because we
saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) from that reprobate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) will sign them now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Madame Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I will not sign them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. <div class="bookquote">``If I am to be married to
Lord Nidderdale as you all say, I am sure I ought to sign nothing
without telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). And if the property was once made to be mine,
I don't think I ought to give it up again because papa says that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
is going to be ruined. I think that's a reason for not giving it up
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't yours to give. It's mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte gnashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
teeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you can do what you like with it without my signing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said
Marie.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) paused a moment, and then laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand gently upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) yet once again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) voice was changed, and was
very hoarse. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) still tried to be gentle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Marie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``will you do this to save your father from destruction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did not believe a word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) natural enemy,
making her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) aware that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) purpose to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) as a chattel for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own advantage, and never allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) for a moment to suppose
that aught that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did was to be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) happiness. And now,
almost in a breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that this money was wanted that
it might be settled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) and the man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was to be married,
and then that it might be used to save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from instant ruin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
believed neither one story nor the other. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) should have done
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was desired in this matter can hardly be disputed. The father
had used her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) name because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter and should not have betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trust. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had
steeled herself to obstinacy against him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in all things. Even yet,
after all that had passed, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had consented to marry Lord
Nidderdale, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been forced by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had learned to
despise Sir Felix Carbury, there was present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) an idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
might escape with the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) really loved. But any such hope could
depend only on the possession of the money which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) now claimed as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own. Melmotte had endeavoured to throw a certain supplicatory
pathos into the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>); but, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was in some
degree successful with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mouth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
forehead still threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was always threatening her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). All her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
thoughts respecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) reverted to that inward assertion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
might <div class="bookquote">``cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to pieces''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) liked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) question in
the pathetic strain. <div class="bookquote">``Will you do this now,--to save us all from
ruin?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eyes still threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face as though watching for the
personal attack which would be made upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``no, I won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Madame Melmotte.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) glanced round for a moment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) pseudo-mother with contempt.
<div class="bookquote">``No;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I ought,--and I won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>shouted Melmotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) merely shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
mean that you, my own child, will attempt to rob your father just at
the moment you can destroy him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by your wickedness?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
head but said no other word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nec pueros coram populo Medea trucidet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let not Medea with unnatural rage
Slaughter her (<font color='blue'><b>Medea</b></font>) mangled infants on the stage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Nor will I attempt to harrow my readers by a close description of the
scene which followed. Poor Marie! That cutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) up into pieces was
commenced after a most savage fashion. Marie crouching down hardly
uttered a sound. But Madame Melmotte frightened beyond endurance
screamed at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) voice,--<div class="bookquote">``Ah, Melmotte, tu la tueras!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) tried to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) prey. <div class="bookquote">``Will you sign them
now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, panting. At that moment Croll, frightened by the
screams, burst into the room. It was perhaps not the first time that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had interfered to save Melmotte from the effects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own wrath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Melmotte, vat is de matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>asked the clerk.

<p/>Melmotte was out of breath and could hardly tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) story. Marie
gradually recovered herself, and crouched, cowering, in a corner of
a sofa, by no means vanquished in spirit, but with a feeling that
the very life had been crushed out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) body. Madame Melmotte
was standing weeping copiously, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) handkerchief up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Will you sign the papers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Melmotte demanded. Marie, lying
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was, all in a heap, merely shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Pig!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said
Melmotte,--<div class="bookquote">``wicked, ungrateful pig.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Ma'am-moiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>said Croll, <div class="bookquote">``you should oblige your fader.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Ma'am-moiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>said Croll, <div class="bookquote">``you should
oblige your fader.'' (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wretched, wicked girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte, collecting the papers
together. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) left the room, and followed by Croll descended to
the study, whence the Longestaffes and Mr. Bideawhile had long since
taken their departure.

<p/>Madame Melmotte came and stood over the girl, but for some minutes
spoke never a word. Marie lay on the sofa, all in a heap, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
hair dishevelled and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) dress disordered, breathing hard, but
uttering no sobs and shedding no tears. The stepmother,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) might
so be called,--did not think of attempting to persuade where her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>)
husband had failed. She (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) feared Melmotte so thoroughly, and was so
timid in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) own person, that she (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) could not understand
the girl's courage. Melmotte was to her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) an awful being, powerful as
Satan,--whom she (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) never openly disobeyed, though she (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) daily deceived
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and was constantly detected in her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) deceptions. Marie seemed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to have all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father's stubborn, wicked courage, and very much
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) power. At the present moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did not dare to tell the girl
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been wrong. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) husband when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
said that destruction was coming, and had partly believed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
declared that the destruction might be averted by Marie's obedience.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) life had been passed in almost daily fear of destruction. To
Marie the last two years of splendour had been so long that they had
produced a feeling of security. But to the elder woman the two years
had not sufficed to eradicate the remembrance of former reverses, and
never for a moment had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt herself to be secure. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
asked the girl what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would like to have done for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had killed me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie said, slowly dragging herself up from the sofa,
and retreating without another word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own room.

<p/>In the meantime another scene was being acted in the room below.
Melmotte after he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) reached the room hardly made a reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
daughter,--merely saying that nothing would overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wicked
obstinacy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) made no allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own violence, nor had Croll the
courage to expostulate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) now that the immediate danger was
over. The Great Financier again arranged the papers, just as they had
been laid out before,--as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that the girl might be
brought down to sign them there. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went on to explain to
Croll what he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had wanted to have done,--how necessary it was that the
thing should be done, and how terribly cruel it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) that in
such a crisis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) should be hampered, impeded,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) did not
venture to his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) clerk to say ruined,--by the ill-conditioned obstinacy
of a girl! He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) explained very fully how absolutely the property was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own, how totally the girl was without any right to withhold it
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)! How monstrous in its injustice was the present position
of things! In all this Croll fully agreed. Then Melmotte went on
to declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would not feel the slightest scruple in writing
Marie's signature to the papers himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was the girl's father and
was justified in acting for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). The property was his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own property,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was justified in doing with it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pleased. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would have no scruple in writing his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) daughter's name. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) looked
up at the clerk. The clerk again assented,--after a fashion, not by
any means with the comfortable certainty with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had signified
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) employer's first propositions. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did
not, at any rate, hint any disapprobation of the step which Melmotte
proposed to take. Then Melmotte went a step farther, and explained
that the only difficulty in reference to such a transaction would
be that the signature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) daughter would be required to be
corroborated by that of a witness before he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could use it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
again looked up at Croll;--but on this occasion Croll did not move a
muscle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) face. There certainly was no assent. Melmotte continued
to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>); but then came upon the old clerk's countenance a
stern look which amounted to very strong dissent. And yet Croll had
been conversant with some irregular doings in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) time, and Melmotte
knew well the extent of Croll's experience. Then Melmotte made a
little remark to himself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knows that the game is pretty well
over.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You had better return to the city now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) said aloud. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall follow you in half an hour. It is quite possible that I may
bring my daughter with me. If I can make her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) understand this thing I
shall do so. In that case I shall want you to be ready.''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>Croll again
smiled, and again assented, and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) way.

<p/>But Melmotte made no further attempt upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) daughter. As soon as
Croll was gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) searched among various papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) desk and
drawers, and having found two signatures, those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) daughter and
of this German clerk, set to work tracing them with some thin tissue
paper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) present operation by bolting his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) door and
pulling down the blinds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) practised the two signatures for the best
part of an hour. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) forged them on the various documents;--and,
having completed the operation, refolded them, placed them in a
little locked bag of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had always kept the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) purse,
and then, with the bag in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) hand, was taken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) brougham into
the city.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXVIII.

<p/>MISS LONGESTAFFE AGAIN AT CAVERSHAM.


<p/>All this time Mr. Longestaffe was necessarily detained in London
while the three ladies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) family were living forlornly at
Caversham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) younger daughter home on the day after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) visit to Lady Monogram, and in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) had
spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monogram</b></font>) suggested marriage with Mr. Brehgert as a thing utterly
out of the question. Georgiana had made one little fight for her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
independence at the Jermyn Street Hotel. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, papa, I think it's
very hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's hard? I think a great many things are hard; but I have to
bear them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can do nothing for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do nothing for you! Haven't you got a home to live in, and clothes
to wear, and a carriage to go about in,--and books to read if you
choose to read them? What do you expect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, papa, that's nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you dare to tell me that what I say is nonsense?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course there's a house to live in and clothes to wear; but what's
to be the end of it? Sophia, I suppose, is going to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am happy to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) is,--to a most respectable young man and a
thorough gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Dolly has his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own way of going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have nothing to do with Adolphus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor will he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolphus</b></font>) have anything to do with me. If I don't marry what's to
become of me? It isn't that Mr. Brehgert is the sort of man I should
choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) name to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what am I to do? You give up the house in town, and how am I to
see people? It was you sent me to Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't send you to Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was at your suggestion I went there, papa. And of course I could
only see the people he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had there. I like nice people as well as
anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no use talking any more about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that. I must talk about it, and think about it too. If
I can put up with Mr. Brehgert I don't see why you and mamma should
complain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Jew!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People don't think about that as they used to, papa. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has a very
fine income, and I should always have a house in--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Longestaffe became so furious and loud, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
for that time. <div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you mean to tell me that you
will marry that man without my consent, I can't prevent it. But you
shall not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as my daughter. You shall be turned out of my
house, and I will never have your name pronounced in my presence
again. It is disgusting,--degrading,--disgraceful!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>).

<p/>On the next morning before he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) started for Caversham he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) did see Mr.
Brehgert; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) told Georgiana nothing of the interview, nor had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) the courage to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>). The objectionable name was not mentioned
again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father's hearing, but there was a sad scene between
herself, Lady Pomona, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) sister. When Mr. Longestaffe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
younger daughter arrived, the poor mother did not go down into the
hall to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child,--from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had that morning received the
dreadful tidings about the Jew. As to these tidings she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had as yet
heard no direct condemnation from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband. The effect upon Lady
Pomona had been more grievous even than that made upon the father.
Mr. Longestaffe had been able to declare immediately that the
proposed marriage was out of the question, that nothing of the kind
should be allowed, and could take upon himself to see the Jew with
the object of breaking off the engagement. But poor Lady Pomona was
helpless in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) sorrow. If Georgiana chose to marry a Jew tradesman
she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could not help it. But such an occurrence in the family would,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) felt, be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) as though the end of all things had come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
could never again hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) head, never go into society, never
take pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) powdered footmen. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) daughter should have
married a Jew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) didn't think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could pluck up the courage
to look even her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) neighbours Mrs. Yeld and Mrs. Hepworth in the face.
Georgiana found no one in the hall to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), and dreaded to go to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) first went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) maid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) own room, and waited
there till Sophia came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) sat pretending to watch the
process of unpacking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) strove to regain her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) courage. Why need she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
be afraid of anybody? Why, at any rate, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) be afraid of other
females? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) not always been dominant over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother and sister?
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Georgey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``this is wonderful news!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it seems wonderful that anybody should be going to be
married except yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--but such a very odd match!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Sophia. If you don't like it, you need not talk about it.
We shall always have a house in town, and you will not. If you don't
like to come to us, you needn't. That's about all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George wouldn't let me go there at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then--George--had better keep you at home at Toodlam. Where's mamma?
I should have thought somebody might have come and met me to say a
word to me, instead of allowing me to creep into the house like
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma isn't at all well; but she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s up and in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own room. You
mustn't be surprised, Georgey, if you find mamma very--very much cut
up about this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Then Georgiana understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) must be content to
stand all alone in the world, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mind to give up
Mr. Brehgert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I've come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana, stooping down and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Georgiana; oh, Georgiana!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona, slowly raising
herself and covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) face with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``This is
dreadful. It will kill me. It will indeed. I didn't expect it from
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the good of all that, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that it can't be possible. It's unnatural. It's worse
than your wife's sister. I'm sure there's something in the Bible
against it. You never would read your Bible, or you wouldn't be going
to do this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Julia Start has done just the same thing,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Start</b></font>) goes
everywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does your papa say? I'm sure your papa won't allow it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s
fixed about anything, it's about the Jews. An accursed race;--think
of that, Georgiana;--expelled from Paradise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, that's nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scattered about all over the world, so that nobody knows who anybody
is. And it's only since those nasty Radicals came up that they have
been able to sit in Parliament.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of the greatest judges in the land is a Jew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana,
who had already learned to fortify her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) own case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing that the Radicals can do can make them anything else but
what they are. I'm sure that Mr. Whitstable, who is to be your
brother-in-law, will never condescend to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, if there was anybody whom Georgiana Longestaffe had despised
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) youth upwards it was George Whitstable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) had been a
laughing-stock to her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) when they were children, had been regarded
as a lout when he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) left school, and had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) common example of
rural dullness since he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) had become a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) certainly was neither
beautiful nor bright;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>lout</b></font>) was a Conservative squire born of Tory
parents. Nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tory</b></font>) rich,--having but a moderate income, sufficient
to maintain a moderate country house and no more. When first
there came indications that Sophia intended to put up with George
Whitstable, the more ambitious sister did not spare the shafts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
scorn. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was told that George Whitstable would not speak to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) future husband! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was not to marry Mr. Brehgert lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) should
bring disgrace, among others, upon George Whitstable! This was not to
be endured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Mr. Whitstable may keep himself at home at Toodlam and not
trouble his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) head at all about me or my husband. I'm sure I shan't
trouble myself as to what a poor creature like that may think about
me. George Whitstable knows as much about London as I do about the
moon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) has always been in county society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia, <div class="bookquote">``and was staying
only the other day at Lord Cantab's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there were two fools together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana, who at this
moment was very unhappy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Whitstable is an excellent young man, and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) will make
your sister happy; but as for Mr. Brehgert,--I can't bear to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
name mentioned in my hearing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, mamma, it had better not be mentioned. At any rate it shan't
be mentioned again by me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Having so spoken, Georgiana bounced out of
the room and did not meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother and sister again till she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) came
down into the drawing-room before dinner.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) position was one very trying both to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) nerves and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) presumed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father had seen Mr. Brehgert, but did
not in the least know what had passed between them. It might be that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father had been so decided in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) objection as to induce Mr.
Brehgert to abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) intention,--and if this were so, there could
be no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) should endure the misery of having the Jew
thrown in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) face. Among them all they had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
would never become Mrs. Brehgert. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) certainly was not prepared to
nail her (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) colours upon the mast and to live and die for Brehgert. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
was almost sick of the thing herself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) could not back out of
it so as to obliterate all traces of the disgrace. Even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) should
not ultimately marry the Jew, it would be known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had been
engaged to a Jew,--and then it would certainly be said afterwards
that the Jew had jilted her (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was thus vacillating in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) mind,
not knowing whether to go on with Brehgert or to abandon him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>). That
evening Lady Pomona retired immediately after dinner, being <div class="bookquote">``far from
well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>It was of course known to them all that Mr. Brehgert was her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
ailment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) elder daughter, and Georgiana
was left with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father. Not a word was spoken between them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) sat
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) newspaper till he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) went to sleep, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) found herself
alone and deserted in that big room. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) that even the
servants treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) with disdain. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) own maid had already given her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
notice. It was manifestly the intention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) family to ostracise
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) altogether. Of what service would it be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) that Lady Julia
Goldsheiner should be received everywhere, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) herself were to
be left without a single Christian friend? Would a life passed
exclusively among the Jews content even her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) lessened ambition? At
ten o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) father's head and went to bed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) father
grunted less audibly than usual under the operation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) had always
given herself credit for high spirits, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) began to fear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>)
courage would not suffice to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) through sufferings such as
these.

<p/>On the next day her (<font color='blue'><b>Goldsheiner</b></font>) father returned to town, and the three ladies
were left alone. Great preparations were going on for the Whitstable
wedding. Dresses were being made and linen marked, and consultations
held,--from all which things Georgiana was kept quite apart. The
accepted lover came over to lunch, and was made as much of as though
the Whitstables had always kept a town house. Sophy loomed so large
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) triumph and happiness, that it was not to be borne. All
Caversham treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) with a new respect. And yet if Toodlam was a
couple of thousand a year, it was all it was;--and there were two
unmarried sisters! Lady Pomona went half into hysterics every time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) younger daughter, and became in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) way a most oppressive
parent. Oh, heavens;--was Mr. Brehgert with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) two houses worth all
this? A feeling of intense regret for the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was losing came
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>). Even Caversham, the Caversham of old days which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) had
hated, but in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) had made herself respected and partly feared
by everybody about the place,--had charms for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) which seemed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) delightful now that they were lost for ever. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) had always
considered herself to be the first personage in the house,--superior
even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) father;--but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was decidedly the last.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) second evening was worse even than the first. When Mr.
Longestaffe was not at home the family sat in a small dingy room
between the library and the dining-room, and on this occasion the
family consisted only of Georgiana. In the course of the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
went up-stairs and calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister out into the passage demanded
to be told why she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was thus deserted. <div class="bookquote">``Poor mamma is very ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophy</b></font>)</div>said
Sophy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't stand it if I'm to be treated like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Georgiana.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll go away somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I help it, Georgey? It's your own doing. Of course you must
have known that you were going to separate yourself from us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>On the next morning there came a dispatch from Mr. Longestaffe,--of
what nature Georgey did not know as it was addressed to Lady Pomona.
But one enclosure she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was allowed to see. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophy</b></font>)</div>said Sophy,
<div class="bookquote">``thinks you ought to know how Dolly feels about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophy</b></font>)</div>And then a
letter from Dolly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father was put into Georgey's hands. The
letter was as follows:--


<p/>MY DEAR FATHER,--

<p/>Can it be true that Georgey is thinking of marrying that
horrid vulgar Jew, old Brehgert? The fellows say so; but I
can't believe it. I'm sure you wouldn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>). You ought
to lock her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) up.

<p/>Yours affectionately,

<p/>A. LONGESTAFFE.


<p/>Dolly's letters made his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) father very angry, as, short as they were,
they always contained advice or instruction, such as should come from
a father to a son, rather than from a son to a father. This letter
had not been received with a welcome. Nevertheless the head of the
family had thought it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) while to make use of it, and had sent
it to Caversham in order that it might be shown to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rebellious
daughter.

<p/>And so Dolly had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) ought to be locked up! She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)'d like to
see somebody do it! As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had read her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) brother's epistle she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)
tore it into fragments and threw it away in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) sister's presence.
<div class="bookquote">``How can mamma be such a hypocrite as to pretend to care what Dolly
says? Who doesn't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>)'s an idiot? And papa has thought it
worth his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) while to send that down here for me to see! Well, after
that I must say that I don't much care what papa does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why Dolly shouldn't have an opinion as well as anybody
else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophy</b></font>)</div>said Sophy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As well as George Whitstable? As far as stupidness goes they are
about the same. But Dolly has a little more knowledge of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we all know, Georgiana,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister that</b></font>)</div>rejoined the elder sister,
<div class="bookquote">``that for cuteness and that kind of thing one must look among the
commercial classes, and especially among a certain sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sister that</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've done with you all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey</b></font>)</div>said Georgey rushing out of the room. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
have nothing more to do with any one of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div><p/>But it is very difficult for a young lady to have done with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
family! A young man may go anywhere, and may be lost at sea; or come
and claim his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) property after twenty years. A young man may demand an
allowance, and has almost a right to live alone. The young male bird
is supposed to fly away from the paternal nest. But the daughter of
a house is compelled to adhere to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father till she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shall get a
husband. The only way in which Georgey could <div class="bookquote">``have done''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey</b></font>)</div>with them
all at Caversham would be by trusting herself to Mr. Brehgert, and at
the present moment she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) did not know whether Mr. Brehgert did or did
not consider himself as engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).

<p/>That day also passed away with ineffable tedium. At one time she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was
so beaten down by ennui that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) almost offered her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) assistance to
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sister in reference to the wedding garments. In spite of the
very bitter words which had been spoken in the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would
have done so had Sophy afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the slightest opportunity. But
Sophy was heartlessly cruel in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) indifference. In her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) younger days
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had had her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bad things, and now,--with George Whitstable by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
side,--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) meant to have good things, the goodness of which was
infinitely enhanced by the badness of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sister's things. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
had been so greatly despised that the charm of despising again
was irresistible. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was able to reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cruelty to
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) conscience by telling herself that duty required her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to show
implacable resistance to such a marriage as this which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sister
contemplated. Therefore Georgiana dragged out another day, not in the
least knowing what was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) fate.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXIX.

<p/>THE BREHGERT CORRESPONDENCE.


<p/>Mr. Longestaffe had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) daughter down to Caversham on a
Wednesday. During the Thursday and Friday she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had passed a very sad
time, not knowing whether she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was or was not engaged to marry Mr.
Brehgert. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father had declared to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would break off
the match, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had seen Mr. Brehgert with that
purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had certainly given no consent, and had never hinted to
any one of the family an idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was disposed to yield. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) felt that, at any rate with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had not adhered to
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) purpose with tenacity, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to return
to London with a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might still be controlled. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
was beginning to be angry with Mr. Brehgert, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had
taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) dismissal from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father without consulting her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). It was
necessary that something should be settled, something known. Life
such as that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was leading now would drive her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mad. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had all the
disadvantages of the Brehgert connection and none of the advantages.
She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not comfort herself with thinking of the Brehgert wealth
and the Brehgert houses, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was living under the general
ban of Caversham on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) Brehgert associations. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was
beginning to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) herself must write to Mr. Brehgert,--only
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) did not know what to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>).

<p/>But on the Saturday morning she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) got a letter from Mr. Brehgert.
It was handed to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was sitting at breakfast with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
sister,--who at that moment was triumphant with a present of
gooseberries which had been sent over from Toodlam. The Toodlam
gooseberries were noted throughout Suffolk, and when the letters were
being brought in Sophia was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) lover's offering from the
basket with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) own fair hands. <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey</b></font>)</div>Georgey had exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``to
send a pottle of gooseberries to his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) lady love across the country!
Who but George Whitstable would do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you get nothing but gems and gold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophy</b></font>)</div>Sophy retorted. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't suppose that Mr. Brehgert knows what a gooseberry is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>At that
moment the letter was brought in, and Georgiana knew the writing. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose that's from Mr. Brehgert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophy</b></font>)</div>said Sophy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it matters much to you who it's from.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) tried to be
composed and stately, but the letter was too important to allow of
composure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) retired to read it in privacy.

<p/>The letter was as follows:--


<p/>MY DEAR GEORGIANA,

<p/>Your father came to me the day after I was to have met you
at Lady Monogram's party. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) then that I would not
write to you till I had taken a day or two to consider
what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said to me;--and also that I thought it better
that you should have a day or two to consider what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
might say to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has now repeated what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said at our
first interview, almost with more violence; for I must say
that I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has allowed himself to be violent when it
was surely unnecessary.

<p/>The long and short of it is this. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) altogether
disapproves of your promise to marry me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has given
three reasons;--first that I am in trade; secondly that
I am much older than you, and have a family; and thirdly
that I am a Jew. In regard to the first I can hardly
think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is earnest. I have explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) that my
business is that of a banker; and I can hardly conceive it
to be possible that any gentleman in England should object
to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) daughter marrying a banker, simply because the man
is a banker. There would be a blindness of arrogance in
such a proposition of which I think your father to be
incapable. This has merely been added in to strengthen his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
other objections.

<p/>As to my age, it is just fifty-one. I do not at all think
myself too old to be married again. Whether I am too old
for you is for you to judge,--as is also that question of
my children who, of course, should you become my wife will
be to some extent a care upon your shoulders. As this is
all very serious you will not, I hope, think me wanting in
gallantry if I say that I should hardly have ventured to
address you if you had been quite a young girl. No doubt
there are many years between us;--and so I think there
should be. A man of my age hardly looks to marry a woman
of the same standing as himself. But the question is one
for the lady to decide,--and you must decide it now.

<p/>As to my religion, I acknowledge the force of what your
father says,--though I think that a gentleman brought up
with fewer prejudices would have expressed himself in
language less likely to give offence. However I am a man
not easily offended; and on this occasion I am ready to
take what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has said in good part. I can easily conceive
that there should be those who think that the husband and
wife should agree in religion. I am indifferent to it
myself. I shall not interfere with you if you make me
happy by becoming my wife, nor, I suppose, will you with
me. Should you have a daughter or daughters I am quite
willing that they should be brought up subject to your
influence.

<p/>There was a plain-speaking in this which made Georgiana look round
the room as though to see whether any one was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
read it.

<p/>But no doubt your father objects to me specially because
I am a Jew. If I were an atheist he (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>) might, perhaps, say
nothing on the subject of religion. On this matter as well
as on others it seems to me that your father has hardly
kept pace with the movements of the age. Fifty years ago
whatever claim a Jew might have to be as well considered
as a Christian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) certainly was not so considered.
Society was closed against him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), except under special
circumstances, and so were all the privileges of high
position. But that has been altered. Your father does not
admit the change; but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is blind to it, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does not wish to see.

<p/>I say all this more as defending myself than as combating
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) views with you. It must be for you and for you alone
to decide how far his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) views shall govern you. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has told
me, after a rather peremptory fashion, that I have behaved
badly to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) family because I did not go to
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the first instance when I thought of obtaining
the honour of an alliance with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter. I have been
obliged to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that in this matter I disagree with
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entirely, though in so telling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I endeavoured to
restrain myself from any appearance of warmth. I had not
the pleasure of meeting you in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house, nor had I any
acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). And again, at the risk of being
thought uncourteous, I must say that you are to a certain
degree emancipated by age from that positive subordination
to which a few years ago you probably submitted without a
question. If a gentleman meets a lady in society, as I met
you in the home of our friend Mr. Melmotte, I do not think
that the gentleman is to be debarred from expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
feelings because the lady may possibly have a parent. Your
father, no doubt with propriety, had left you to be the
guardian of yourself, and I cannot submit to be accused of
improper conduct because, finding you in that condition, I
availed myself of it.

<p/>And now, having said so much, I must leave the question to
be decided entirely by yourself. I beg you to understand
that I do not at all wish to hold you to a promise merely
because the promise has been given. I readily acknowledge
that the opinion of your family should be considered by
you, though I will not admit that I was bound to consult
that opinion before I spoke to you. It may well be that
your regard for me or your appreciation of the comforts
with which I may be able to surround you, will not suffice
to reconcile you to such a breach from your own family as
your father, with much repetition, has assured me will be
inevitable. Take a day or two to think of this and turn it
well over in your mind. When I last had the happiness of
speaking to you, you seemed to think that your parents
might raise objections, but that those objections would
give way before an expression of your own wishes. I was
flattered by your so thinking; but, if I may form any
judgment from your father's manner, I must suppose that
you were mistaken. You will understand that I do not say
this as any reproach to you. Quite the contrary. I think
your father is irrational; and you may well have failed to
anticipate that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should be so.

<p/>As to my own feelings they remain exactly as they were
when I endeavoured to explain them to you. Though I do not
find myself to be too old to marry, I do think myself too
old to write love letters. I have no doubt you believe me
when I say that I entertain a most sincere affection for
you; and I beseech you to believe me in saying further
that should you become my wife it shall be the study of my
life to make you happy.

<p/>It is essentially necessary that I should allude to one
other matter, as to which I have already told your father
what I will now tell you. I think it probable that within
this week I shall find myself a loser of a very large sum
of money through the failure of a gentleman whose bad
treatment of me I will the more readily forgive because
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was the means of making me known to you. This you must
understand is private between you and me, though I have
thought it proper to inform your father. Such loss, if it
fall upon me, will not interfere in the least with the
income which I have proposed to settle upon you for your
use after my death; and, as your father declares that in
the event of your marrying me he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will neither give to you
nor bequeath to you a shilling, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might have abstained
from telling me to my face that I was a bankrupt merchant
when I myself told him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) of my loss. I am not a bankrupt
merchant nor at all likely to become so. Nor will this
loss at all interfere with my present mode of living. But
I have thought it right to inform you of it, because, if
it occur,--as I think it will,--I shall not deem it right
to keep a second establishment probably for the next two
or three years. But my house at Fulham and my stables
there will be kept up just as they are at present.

<p/>I have now told you everything which I think it is
necessary you should know, in order that you may determine
either to adhere to or to recede from your engagement.
When you have resolved you will let me know,--but a day or
two may probably be necessary for your decision. I hope I
need not say that a decision in my favour will make me a
happy man.

<p/>I am, in the meantime, your affectionate friend,

<p/>EZEKIEL BREHGERT.


<p/>This very long letter puzzled Georgey a good deal, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), at
the time of reading it, very much in doubt as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would do.
She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) could understand that it was a plain-spoken and truth-telling
letter. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), to herself, gave it praise for those virtues;
but that it imbued her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) unconsciously with a thorough belief. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
was apt to suspect deceit in other people;--but it did not occur to
her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) that Mr. Brehgert had written a single word with an attempt to
deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). But the single-minded genuine honesty of the letter was
altogether thrown away upon her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) never said to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
read it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) might safely trust herself to this man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
were a Jew, though greasy and like a butcher, though over fifty and
with a family, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an honest man. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) did not see that the
letter was particularly sensible;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) did allow herself to be
pained by the total absence of romance. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was annoyed at the first
allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) age, and angry at the second; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had never
supposed that Brehgert had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to be younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was.
She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was well aware that the world in general attributes more years
to unmarried women than they have lived, as a sort of equalising
counter-weight against the pretences which young women make on the
other side, or the lies which are told on their behalf. Nor had she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
wished to appear peculiarly young in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) eyes. But, nevertheless,
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) regarded the reference to be uncivil,--perhaps almost
butcher-like,--and it had its effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). And then the allusion
to the <div class="bookquote">``daughter or daughters''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) told herself that it
was vulgar,--just what a butcher might have said. And although she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
was quite prepared to call her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) father the most irrational, the most
prejudiced, and most ill-natured of men, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was displeased that
Mr. Brehgert should take such a liberty with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>). But the passage
in Mr. Brehgert's letter which was most distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was that
which told her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) of the loss which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) might probably incur through his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
connection with Melmotte. What right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) to incur a loss which
would incapacitate him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) from keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) engagements with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)? The
town-house had been the great persuasion, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) absolutely had
the face to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) that there was to be no town-house for three
years. When she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) read this she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) ought to be indignant,
and for a few moments was minded to sit down without further
consideration and tell the man with considerable scorn that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would
have nothing more to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>But on that side too there would be terrible bitterness. How would
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) have fallen from her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) greatness when, barely forgiven by her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
father and mother for the vile sin which she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had contemplated, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
should consent to fill a common bridesmaid place at the nuptials of
George Whitstable! And what would then be left to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) in life? This
episode of the Jew would make it quite impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) again
to contest the question of the London house with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) father. Lady
Pomona and Mrs. George Whitstable would be united with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>). There would be no <div class="bookquote">``season''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) would be nobody
at Caversham. As for London, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) would hardly wish to go there!
Everybody would know the story of the Jew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) could
have plucked up courage to face the world as the Jew's wife, but not
as the young woman who had wanted to marry the Jew and had failed.
How would her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) future life go with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), should she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now make up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
mind to retire from the proposed alliance? If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
father to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) abroad at once, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would do it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not
now in a condition to make any terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father. As all this
gradually passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would so
far take Mr. Brehgert's advice as to postpone her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answer till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
well considered the matter.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slept upon it, and the next day she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother a few
questions. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma, have you any idea what papa means to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>Lady Pomona's voice was not gracious, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was free from that fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) daughter's ascendancy which had
formerly affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must have some plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must explain yourself. I don't know why he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should have any
particular plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) go to London next year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will depend upon money, I suppose. What makes you ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I have been very cruelly circumstanced. Everybody must
see that. I'm sure you do, mamma. The long and the short of it is
this;--if I give up my engagement, will he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) take us abroad for a
year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't suppose that I should be very comfortable in England. If
we are to remain here at Caversham, how am I to hope ever to get
settled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophy is doing very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, there are not two George Whitstables;--thank God.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
had meant to be humble and supplicating, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) could not restrain
herself from the use of that one shaft. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean but what Sophy
may be very happy, and I am sure that I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will. But that won't
do me any good. I should be very unhappy here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how you are to find any one to marry you by going
abroad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona, <div class="bookquote">``and I don't see why your papa is to be
taken away from his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) own home. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) likes Caversham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am to be sacrificed on every side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey</b></font>)</div>said Georgey, stalking
out of the room. But still she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) could not make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) mind what letter
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) would write to Mr. Brehgert, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) slept upon it another night.

<p/>On the next day after breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) did write her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) letter, though when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) sat down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) task she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) had not clearly made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) mind what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) would say. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) did get it written, and here it is.


<p/>Caversham,
Monday.

<p/>MY DEAR MR. BREHGERT,

<p/>As you told me not to hurry, I have taken a little time
to think about your letter. Of course it would be very
disagreeable to quarrel with papa and mamma and everybody.
And if I do do so, I'm sure somebody ought to be very
grateful. But papa has been very unfair in what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has
said. As to not asking him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), it could have been of no good,
for of course he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would be against it. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) thinks a great
deal of the Longestaffe family, and so, I suppose, ought
I. But the world does change so quick that one doesn't
think of anything now as one used to do. Anyway, I don't
feel that I'm bound to do what papa tells me just because
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) says it. Though I'm not quite so old as you seem to
think, I'm old enough to judge for myself,--and I mean to
do so. You say very little about affection, but I suppose
I am to take all that for granted.

<p/>I don't wonder at papa being annoyed about the loss of the
money. It must be a very great sum when it will prevent
your having a house in London,--as you agreed. It does
make a great difference, because, of course, as you have
no regular place in the country, one could only see one's
friends in London. Fulham is all very well now and then,
but I don't think I should like to live at Fulham all the
year through. You talk of three years, which would be
dreadful. If as you say it will not have any lasting
effect, could you not manage to have a house in town? If
you can do it in three years, I should think you could do
it now. I should like to have an answer to this question.
I do think so much about being the season in town!

<p/>As for the other parts of your letter, I knew very well
beforehand that papa would be unhappy about it. But I
don't know why I'm to let that stand in my way when so
very little is done to make me happy. Of course you will
write to me again, and I hope you will say something
satisfactory about the house in London.

<p/>Yours always sincerely,

<p/>GEORGIANA LONGESTAFFE.


<p/>It probably never occurred to Georgey that Mr. Brehgert would under
any circumstances be anxious to go back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) engagement. She (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) so
fully recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) own value as a Christian lady of high birth and
position giving herself to a commercial Jew, that she (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) thought that
under any circumstances Mr. Brehgert would be only too anxious to
stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) bargain. Nor had she (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) any idea that there was anything
in her (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) letter which could probably offend him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>)
might at any rate make good her (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) claim to the house in London; and
that as there were other difficulties on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would yield to
her (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) on this point. But as yet she (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) hardly knew Mr. Brehgert. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) did
not lose a day in sending to her (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) a second letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>LONGESTAFFE</b></font>) letter
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) office in the city, and there answered it without a
moment's delay.


<p/>No. 7, St. Cuthbert's Court, London,
Tuesday, July 16, 18--.

<p/>MY DEAR MISS LONGESTAFFE,

<p/>You say it would be very disagreeable to you to quarrel
with your papa and mamma; and as I agree with you, I will
take your letter as concluding our intimacy. I should not,
however, be dealing quite fairly with you or with myself
if I gave you to understand that I felt myself to be
coerced to this conclusion simply by your qualified assent
to your parents' views. It is evident to me from your
letter that you would not wish to be my wife unless I can
supply you with a house in town as well as with one in the
country. But this for the present is out of my power. I
would not have allowed my losses to interfere with your
settlement because I had stated a certain income; and
must therefore to a certain extent have compromised my
children. But I should not have been altogether happy till
I had replaced them in their former position, and must
therefore have abstained from increased expenditure till
I had done so. But of course I have no right to ask you
to share with me the discomfort of a single home. I may
perhaps add that I had hoped that you would have looked to
your happiness to another source, and that I will bear my
disappointment as best I may.

<p/>As you may perhaps under these circumstances be unwilling
that I should wear the ring you gave me, I return it by
post. I trust you will be good enough to keep the trifle
you were pleased to accept from me, in remembrance of one
who will always wish you well.

<p/>Yours sincerely,

<p/>EZEKIEL BREHGERT.


<p/>And so it was all over! Georgey, when she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) read this letter, was very
indignant at her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) lover's conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) did not believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) own
letter had at all been of a nature to warrant it. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) had regarded
herself as being quite sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), and only so far doubting herself,
as to be able to make her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) own terms because of such doubts. And now
the Jew had rejected her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) read this last letter over and over
again, and the more she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) read it the more she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) felt that in her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) heart
of hearts she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) had intended to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>). There would have been
inconveniences no doubt, but they would have been less than the
sorrow on the other side. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) saw nothing before her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) but a long
vista of Caversham dullness, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) would be trampled upon by
her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) father and mother, and scorned by Mr. and Mrs. George Whitstable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) got up and walked about the room thinking of vengeance. But what
vengeance was possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>)? Everybody belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) would take
the part of the Jew in that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had now done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) could not ask
Dolly to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>); nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) father to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with the
stern frown of paternal indignation. There could be no revenge. For
a time,--only for a few seconds,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) would write to
Mr. Brehgert and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) had not intended to bring about
this termination of their engagement. This, no doubt, would have been
an appeal to the Jew for mercy;--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) could not quite descend to
that. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) would keep the watch and chain he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>), and
which somebody had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) had not cost less than a hundred and
fifty guineas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) could not wear them, as people would know whence
they had come; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) might exchange them for jewels which she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) could
wear.

<p/>At lunch she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) said nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) sister, but in the course of the
afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) thought it best to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``as you and papa take it so much to heart, I have broken off
everything with Mr. Brehgert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it must be broken off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona. This was very
ungracious,--so much so that Georgey almost flounced out of the room.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you heard from the man?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) ladyship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has answered me; and it is all
settled. I thought that you would have said something kind to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>And the unfortunate young woman burst out into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was so dreadful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona;--<div class="bookquote">``so very dreadful. I never
heard of anything so bad. When young what's-his-name married the
tallow-chandler's daughter I thought it would have killed me if
it had been Dolly; but this was worse than that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) father was a
methodist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They had neither of them a shilling of money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey</b></font>)</div>said Georgey through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your papa says this man was next door to a bankrupt. But it's
all over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now we must all remain here at Caversham till people forget
it. It has been very hard upon George Whitstable, because of course
everybody has known it through the county. I once thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) would
have been off, and I really don't know that we could have said
anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophy</b></font>)</div>At that moment Sophy entered the room. <div class="bookquote">``It's all over
between Georgiana and the--man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona, who hardly saved
herself from stigmatising him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) by a further reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) religion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it would be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it could never have really taken place,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said their
mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I beg that nothing more may be said about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said
Georgiana. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose, mamma, you will write to papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must send him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch and chain, Georgey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What business is that of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) must. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) papa would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) keep it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>To such a miserable depth of humility had the younger Miss
Longestaffe been brought by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) ill-considered intimacy with the
Melmottes! Georgiana, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) looked back on this miserable episode
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) life, always attributed her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) grief to the scandalous breach of
compact of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father had been guilty.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXX.

<p/>RUBY PREPARES FOR SERVICE.


<p/>Our poor old honest friend John Crumb was taken away to durance vile
after his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) performance in the street with Sir Felix, and was locked up
for the remainder of the night. This indignity did not sit so heavily
on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spirits as it might have done on those of a quicker nature.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had not killed the baronet, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
therefore enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) revenge without the necessity of <div class="bookquote">``swinging
for it at Bury.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That in itself was a comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Then it was a
great satisfaction to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``served the young man out''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the actual presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) Ruby. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not prone to give himself
undue credit for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) capability and willingness to knock his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) enemies
about; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did think that Ruby must have observed on this occasion
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was the better man of the two. And, to John, a night in the
station-house was no great personal inconvenience. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
very proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) four-post bed at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not care very much
for such luxuries as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) himself was concerned. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
feel any disgrace from being locked up for the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was very
good-humoured with the policeman, who seemed perfectly to understand
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) nature, and was as meek as a child when the lock was turned
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lay down on the hard bench, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) comforted himself
with thinking that Ruby would surely never care any more for the
<div class="bookquote">``baronite''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>since she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) go down like a cur without striking
a blow. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought a good deal about Ruby, but never attributed any
blame to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) share in the evils that had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/>The next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was taken before the magistrates, but was told at
an early hour of the day that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was again free. Sir Felix was not
much the worse for what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and had refused to make
any complaint against the man who had beaten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). John Crumb shook
hands cordially with the policeman who had had him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) in charge, and
suggested beer. The constable, with regrets, was forced to decline,
and bade adieu to his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) late prisoner with the expression of a hope
that they might meet again before long. <div class="bookquote">``You come down to Bungay,''
 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll show you how we live there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div><p/>From the police-office he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) went direct to Mrs. Pipkin's house, and at
once asked for Ruby. He (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) was told that Ruby was out with the children,
and was advised both by Mrs. Pipkin and Mrs. Hurtle not to present
himself before Ruby quite yet. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)'s a
thinking how heavy you were upon that young gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I wasn't;--not particular. Lord love you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) ain't a hair the
wuss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You let her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) alone for a time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hurtle. <div class="bookquote">``A little neglect
will do her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John,--<div class="bookquote">``only I wouldn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) to have it bad. You'll
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) wittles regular, Mrs. Pipkin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div><p/>It was then explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) that the neglect proposed should not
extend to any deprivation of food, and he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) leave, receiving
an assurance from Mrs. Hurtle that he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) should be summoned to town
as soon as it was thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) presence there would serve his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>)
purposes; and with loud promises repeated to each of the friendly
women that as soon as ever a <div class="bookquote">``line should be dropped''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) would appear
again upon the scene, he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) took Mrs. Pipkin aside, and suggested that
if there were <div class="bookquote">``any hextras,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) was ready to pay for them. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>)
took his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) leave without seeing Ruby, and went back to Bungay.

<p/>When Ruby returned with the children she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was told that John Crumb had
called. <div class="bookquote">``I thought as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was in prison,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should they keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in prison for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
hasn't done nothing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) oughtn't to have done. That young man was
dragging you about as far as I can make out, and Mr. Crumb just did
as anybody ought to have done to prevent it. Of course they weren't
going to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) in prison for that. Prison indeed! It isn't him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) as
ought to be in prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) now, aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone down to Bungay to mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) business, and won't be coming here
any more of a fool's errand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) must have seen now pretty well what's
worth having, and what ain't. Beauty is but skin deep, Ruby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John Crumb 'd be after me again to-morrow, if I'd give him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
encouragement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby. <div class="bookquote">``If I'd hold up my finger he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)'d come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then John Crumb's a fool for his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) pains, that's all; and now do you
go about your work.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>Ruby didn't like to be told to go about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
work, and tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) head, and slammed the kitchen door, and scolded
the servant girl, and then sat down to cry. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) to do with
herself now? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had an idea that Felix would not come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
after the treatment he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) had received;--and a further idea that if he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>)
did come he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) was not, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) phrased it to herself, <div class="bookquote">``of much account.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) certainly did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) the better for having been beaten,
though, at the time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had been disposed to take his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) part. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) did
not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would ever dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) again. That had been
the charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) life in London, and that was now all over. And as
for marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>),--she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) began to feel certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) did not intend
it. John Crumb was a big, awkward, dull, uncouth lump of a man, with
whom Ruby thought it impossible that a girl should be in love. Love
and John Crumb were poles asunder. But--! Ruby did not like wheeling
the perambulator about Islington, and being told by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) aunt Pipkin
to go about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) work. What Ruby did like was being in love and
dancing; but if all that must come to an end, then there would be a
question whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could not do better for herself, than by staying
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) aunt and wheeling the perambulator about Islington.

<p/>Mrs. Hurtle was still living in solitude in the lodgings, and having
but little to do on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own behalf, had devoted herself to the
interest of John Crumb. A man more unlike one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) own countrymen
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had never seen. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has any ideas at all in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
head,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had said to Mrs. Pipkin. Mrs. Pipkin had replied that Mr.
Crumb had certainly a very strong idea of marrying Ruby Ruggles. Mrs.
Hurtle had smiled, thinking that Mrs. Pipkin was also very unlike
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) own countrywomen. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was very kind to Mrs. Pipkin, ordering
rice-puddings on purpose that the children might eat them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
was quite determined to give John Crumb all the aid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) power.

<p/>In order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) might give effectual aid she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) took Mrs. Pipkin into
confidence, and prepared a plan of action in reference to Ruby. Mrs.
Pipkin was to appear as chief actor on the scene, but the plan was
altogether Mrs. Hurtle's plan. On the day following John's return
to Bungay Mrs. Pipkin summoned Ruby into the back parlour, and thus
addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ruby, you know, this must come to an end now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What must come to an end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't stay here always, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I work hard, Aunt Pipkin, and I don't get no wages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't do with more than one girl,--and there's the keep if there
isn't wages. Besides, there's other reasons. Your grandfather won't
have you back there; that's certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't go back to grandfather, if it was ever so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must go somewheres. You didn't come to stay here
always,--nor I couldn't have you. You must go into service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anybody as 'd have me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must put a `vertisement into the paper. You'd better say as
nursemaid, as you seems to take kindly to children. And I must give
you a character;--only I shall say just the truth. You mustn't ask
much wages just at first.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>Ruby looked very sorrowful, and the tears
were near her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) eyes. The change from the glories of the music hall
was so startling and so oppressive! <div class="bookquote">``It has got to be done sooner or
later, so you may as well put the `vertisement in this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going to turn me out, Aunt Pipkin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--if that's turning out, I am. You see you never would be
said by me as though I was mistress. You would go out with that
rapscallion when I bid you not. Now when you're in a regular place
like, you must mind when you're spoke to, and it will be best for
you. You've had your swing, and now you see you've got to pay for it.
You must earn your bread, Ruby, as you've quarrelled both with your
lover and with your grandfather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no possible answer to this, and therefore the necessary
notice was put into the paper,--Mrs. Hurtle paying for its insertion.
<div class="bookquote">``Because, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hurtle, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) must stay here really,
till Mr. Crumb comes and takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Pipkin expressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) opinion that Ruby was a <div class="bookquote">``baggage''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>and John Crumb a <div class="bookquote">``soft.''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Pipkin was perhaps a little jealous at the interest which her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) lodger
took in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) niece, thinking perhaps that all Mrs. Hurtle's sympathies
were due to herself.

<p/>Ruby went hither and thither for a day or two, calling upon the
mothers of children who wanted nursemaids. The answers which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had
received had not come from the highest members of the aristocracy,
and the houses which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) visited did not appal her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) by their
splendour. Many objections were made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>). A character from an aunt
was objectionable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ringlets were objectionable. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was a deal
too flighty-looking. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) spoke up much too free. At last one happy
mother of five children offered to take her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) on approval for a month,
at #12 a year, Ruby to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own tea and wash for herself. This
was slavery;--abject slavery. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) too, who had been the beloved
of a baronet, and who might even now be the mistress of a better
house than that into which she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was to go as a servant,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
would only hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) finger! But the place was accepted, and with
broken-hearted sobbings Ruby prepared herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) departure from
aunt Pipkin's roof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you like your place, Ruby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Hurtle said on the afternoon
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) last day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed then I don't like it at all. They're the ugliest children you
ever see, Mrs. Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugly children must be minded as well as pretty ones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the mother of 'em is as cross as cross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's your own fault, Ruby; isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know as I've done anything out of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think it's anything out of the way to be engaged to a
young man and then to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over? All this has come because you
wouldn't keep your word to Mr. Crumb. Only for that your grandfather
wouldn't have turned you out of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) didn't turn me out. I ran away. And it wasn't along of John
Crumb, but because grandfather hauled me about by the hair of my
head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was angry with you about Mr. Crumb. When a young woman
becomes engaged to a young man, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought not to go back from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
word.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>No doubt Mrs. Hurtle, when preaching this doctrine, thought
that the same law might be laid down with propriety for the conduct
of young men. <div class="bookquote">``Of course you have brought trouble on yourself. I am
sorry that you don't like the place. I'm afraid you must go to it
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am agoing,--I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby, probably feeling that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
could but bring herself to condescend so far there might yet be open
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) a way of escape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall write and tell Mr. Crumb where you are placed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Hurtle, don't. What should you write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) for? It ain't
nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) I'd let him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) know if any steps were taken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can forget that, Mrs. Hurtle. Pray don't write. I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
to know as I'm in service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must keep my promise. Why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) know? I don't suppose you
care much now what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) hears about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I do. I wasn't never in service before, and I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What harm can it do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) to know. It is such a come down, Mrs.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing to be ashamed of in that. What you have to be
ashamed of is jilting him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>). It was a bad thing to do;--wasn't it,
Ruby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean nothing bad, Mrs. Hurtle; only why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) say
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had to say himself, instead of bringing another to say it for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)? What would you feel, Mrs. Hurtle, if a man was to come and say
it all out of another man's mouth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I should much care if the thing was well said at last.
You know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hears nothing about you. I think I'd better

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm to go to Mrs. Buggins' to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll send to Mrs. Buggins and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Buggins</b></font>) to get somebody else. You're

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like it, Mrs. Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this man will make you mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house. You say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isn't

woman better. What's the use of a glib tongue if there isn't a heart
with it? What's the use of a lot of tinsel and lacker, if the real
metal isn't there? Sir Felix Carbury could talk, I dare say, but you
don't think now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a very fine fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so beautiful, Mrs. Hurtle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't the spirit of a mouse in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom. Well, Ruby,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't come, Mrs. Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave that to me, Ruby. May I bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if I can?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>Then Ruby in a
very low whisper told Mrs. Hurtle, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) thought proper she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
might bring John Crumb back again. <div class="bookquote">``And there shall be no more
nonsense?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>whispered Ruby.

<p/>On that same night a letter was sent to Mrs. Buggins, which
Mrs. Hurtle also composed, informing that lady that unforeseen
circumstances prevented Ruby Ruggles from keeping the engagement she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
had made; to which a verbal answer was returned that Ruby Ruggles
was an impudent hussey. And then Mrs. Hurtle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own name wrote a
short note to Mr. John Crumb.


<p/>DEAR MR. CRUMB,

<p/>If you will come back to London I think you will find Miss
Ruby Ruggles all that you desire.

<p/>Yours faithfully,

<p/>WINIFRID HURTLE.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)'s had a deal more done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) than I ever knew to be done for

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXXI.

<p/>MR. COHENLUPE LEAVES LONDON.


<p/>Dolly Longestaffe had found himself compelled to go to Fetter Lane
immediately after that meeting in Bruton Street at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) had
consented to wait two days longer for the payment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) money. This
was on a Wednesday, the day appointed for the payment being Friday.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) had undertaken that, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) part, Squercum should be made to
desist from further immediate proceedings, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) could only carry
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) word by visiting Squercum. The trouble to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) was very
great, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) began to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) almost liked it. The excitement
was nearly as good as that of loo. Of course it was a <div class="bookquote">``horrid
bore,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--this having to go about in cabs under the sweltering sun of a
London July day. Of course it was a <div class="bookquote">``horrid bore,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--this doubt about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) money. And it went altogether against the grain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) should be engaged in any matter respecting the family property
in agreement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) father and Mr. Bideawhile. But there was an
importance in it that sustained him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) troubles. It is said
that if you were to take a man of moderate parts and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) Prime
Minister out of hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) might probably do as well as other Prime
Ministers, the greatness of the work elevating the man to its own
level. In that way Dolly was elevated to the level of a man of
business, and felt and enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own capacity. <div class="bookquote">``By George!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It
depended chiefly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whether such a man as Melmotte should or
should not be charged before the Lord Mayor. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I oughtn't to
have promised,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) said to Squercum, sitting in the lawyer's office
on a high-legged stool with a cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) preferred
Squercum to any other lawyer he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had met because Squercum's room was
untidy and homely, because there was nothing awful about it, and
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) could sit in what position he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) pleased, and smoke all the
time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; I don't think you ought, if you ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>said Squercum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You weren't there to be asked, old fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bideawhile shouldn't have asked you to agree to anything in my
absence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>said Squercum indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``It was a very unprofessional
thing on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) part, and so I shall take an opportunity of telling
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was you told me to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--yes. I wanted you to see what they were at in that room; but
I told you to look on and say nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't speak half-a-dozen words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't have spoken those words. Your father then is quite
clear that you did not sign the letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes;--the governor is pig-headed, you know, but he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>)'s honest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a matter of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer. <div class="bookquote">``All men are

Bideawhile's honest; but you've got to fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) deuced close to
prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) getting the better of you. Melmotte has promised to pay
the money on Friday, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s to bring it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to Bruton Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe a word of it;--and I'm sure Bideawhile doesn't. In
what shape will he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) bring it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>)'ll give you a cheque dated on Monday,
and that'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) two days more, and then on Monday there'll be a
note to say the money can't be lodged till Wednesday. There should
be no compromising with such a man. You only get from one mess into
another. I told you neither to do anything or to say anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we can't help ourselves now. You're to be there on Friday.
I particularly bargained for that. If you're there, there won't be
any more compromising.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div><p/>Squercum made one or two further remarks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) client, not at all
flattering to Dolly's vanity,--which might have caused offence had
not there been such perfectly good feeling between the attorney and
the young man. As it was Dolly replied to everything that was said
with increased flattery. <div class="bookquote">``If I was a sharp fellow like you, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, <div class="bookquote">``of course I should get along better; but I ain't,
you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>It was then settled that they should meet each other, and
also meet Mr. Longestaffe senior, Bideawhile, and Melmotte, at twelve
o'clock on Friday morning in Bruton Street.

<p/>Squercum was by no means satisfied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had busied himself in this
matter, and had ferreted things out, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had pretty nearly got
to the bottom of that affair about the houses in the East, and had
managed to induce the heirs of the old man who had died to employ
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). As to the Pickering property he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) had not a doubt on the subject.
Old Longestaffe had been induced by promises of wonderful aid and by
the bribe of a seat at the Board of the South Central Pacific and
Mexican Railway to give up the title-deeds of the property,--as far
as it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) power to give them up; and had endeavoured to induce
Dolly to do so also. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) had failed, Melmotte had supplemented his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
work by ingenuity, with which the reader is acquainted. All this was
perfectly clear to Squercum, who thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) saw before him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) a
most attractive course of proceeding against the Great Financier. It
was pure ambition rather than any hope of lucre that urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
regarded Melmotte as a grand swindler,--perhaps the grandest that the
world had ever known,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) could conceive no greater honour than
the detection, successful prosecution, and ultimate destroying of
so great a man. To have hunted down Melmotte would make Squercum as
great almost as Melmotte himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) felt himself to have been
unfairly hampered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own client. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not believe that the
money would be paid; but delay might rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) Melmotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
heard a good many things in the City, and believed it to be quite out
of the question that Melmotte should raise the money,--but there were
various ways in which a man might escape.

<p/>It may be remembered that Croll, the German clerk, preceded Melmotte
into the City on Wednesday after Marie's refusal to sign the deeds.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), too, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) eyes open, and had perceived that things were not
looking as well as they used to look. Croll had for many years been
true to his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) patron, having been, upon the whole, very well paid for
such truth. There had been times when things had gone badly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>),
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had believed in Melmotte, and, when Melmotte rose, had been
rewarded for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) faith. Mr. Croll at the present time had little
investments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own, not made under his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) employer's auspices, which
would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) not absolutely without bread for his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) family should
the Melmotte affairs at any time take an awkward turn. Melmotte had
never required from him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) service that was actually fraudulent,--had
at any rate never required it by spoken words. Mr. Croll had not
been over-scrupulous, and had occasionally been very useful to Mr.
Melmotte. But there must be a limit to all things; and why should any
man sacrifice himself beneath the ruins of a falling house,--when
convinced that nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) can do can prevent the fall? Mr. Croll
would have been of course happy to witness Miss Melmotte's signature;
but as for that other kind of witnessing,--this clearly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)
thinking was not the time for such good-nature on his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) part.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what's up now;--don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>junior</b></font>)</div>said one of the junior clerks
to Mr. Croll when he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) entered the office in Abchurch Lane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good deal will be up soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the German</b></font>)</div>said the German.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cohenlupe has gone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to vere has Mr. Cohenlupe gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) hasn't been civil enough to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) address. I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) don't
want his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) friends to have to trouble themselves by writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>).
Nobody seems to know what's become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``New York,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Croll</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Croll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They seem to think not. They're too hospitable in New York for Mr.
Cohenlupe just at present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)'s travelling private. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)'s on the
continent somewhere,--half across France by this time; but nobody
knows what route he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) has taken. That'll be a poke in the ribs for the
old boy;--eh, Croll?''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>Croll merely shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what has
become of Miles Grendall,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>continued the clerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ven de rats is going avay it is bad for de house. I like de rats to
stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There seems to have been a regular manufactory of Mexican Railway
scrip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our governor knew noding about dat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>said Croll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) has a hat full of them at any rate. If they could have been kept
up another fortnight they say Cohenlupe would have been worth nearly
a million of money, and the governor would have been as good as the
bank. Is it true they are going to have him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) before the Lord Mayor
about the Pickering title-deeds?''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>Croll declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) knew nothing
about the matter, and settled himself down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) work.

<p/>In little more than two hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) was followed by Melmotte, who thus
reached the City late in the afternoon. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew too late to
raise the money on that day, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might pave the way
for getting it on the next day, which would be Thursday. Of course
the first news which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) heard was of the defection of Mr. Cohenlupe.
It was Croll who told him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) turned back, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) jaw fell, but at
first he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``It's a bad thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Croll</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Croll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--it is bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) had a vast amount of my property in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) hands.
Where has he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>Croll shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It never rains but it
pours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``Well; I'll weather it all yet. I've been
worse than I am now, Croll, as you know, and have had a hundred
thousand pounds at my banker's,--loose cash,--before the month was
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>said Croll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the worst of it is that every one around me is so damnably
jealous. It isn't what I've lost that will crush me, but what men
will say that I've lost. Ever since I began to stand for Westminster
there has been a dead set against me in the City. The whole of that
affair of the dinner was planned,--planned by G--, that it might
ruin me. It was all laid out just as you would lay the foundation of
a building. It is hard for one man to stand against all that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has dealings so large as mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very hard, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they'll find they're mistaken yet. There's too much of the real
stuff, Croll, for them to crush me. Property's a kind of thing that
comes out right at last. It's cut and come again, you know, if the
stuff is really there. But I mustn't stop talking here. I suppose I
shall find Brehgert in Cuthbert's Court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say so, Mr. Melmotte. Mr. Brehgert never leaves much before
six.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Mr. Melmotte took his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) hat and gloves, and the stick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)
usually carried, and went out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) face carefully dressed in its
usually jaunty air. But Croll as he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) went heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) mutter the name of
Cohenlupe between his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) teeth. The part which he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had to act is one very
difficult to any actor. The carrying an external look of indifference
when the heart is sinking within,--or has sunk almost to the very
ground,--is more than difficult; it is an agonizing task. In all
mental suffering the sufferer longs for solitude,--for permission to
cast himself loose along the ground, so that every limb and every
feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) person may faint in sympathy with his (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) heart. A grandly
urbane deportment over a crushed spirit and ruined hopes is beyond
the physical strength of most men;--but there have been men so
strong. Melmotte very nearly accomplished it. It was only to the eyes
of such a one as Herr Croll that the failure was perceptible.

<p/>Melmotte did find Mr. Brehgert. At this time Mr. Brehgert had
completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) correspondence with Miss Longestaffe, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
had mentioned the probability of great losses from the anticipated
commercial failure in Mr. Melmotte's affairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had now heard that
Mr. Cohenlupe had gone upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) travels, and was therefore nearly
sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) anticipation would be correct. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)
received his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) old friend with a smile. When large sums of money are
concerned there is seldom much of personal indignation between man
and man. The loss of fifty pounds or of a few hundreds may create
personal wrath;--but fifty thousand require equanimity. <div class="bookquote">``So Cohenlupe
hasn't been seen in the City to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div>said Brehgert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) has gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte hoarsely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I once told you that Cohenlupe was not the man for large
dealings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--it can't be helped; can it? And what is it now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>Then
Melmotte explained to Mr. Brehgert what it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wanted then,
taking the various documents out of the bag which throughout the
afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand. Mr. Brehgert understood enough
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) friend's affairs, and enough of affairs in general, to
understand readily all that was required. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) examined the documents,
declaring as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) did so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) did not know how the thing could be
arranged by Friday. Melmotte replied that #50,000 was not a very
large sum of money, that the security offered was worth twice as much
as that. <div class="bookquote">``You will leave them with me this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div>said Brehgert.
Melmotte paused for a moment, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would of course do so.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have given much, very much, to have been sufficiently master
of himself to have assented without hesitation;--but then the weight
within was so very heavy!

<p/>Having left the papers and the bag with Mr. Brehgert, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) walked
westwards to the House of Commons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was accustomed to remain in the
City later than this, often not leaving it till seven,--though during
the last week or ten days he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had occasionally gone down to the House
in the afternoon. It was now Wednesday, and there was no evening
sitting;--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) mind was too full of other things to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) to
remember this. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) walked along the Embankment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) thoughts were
very heavy. How would things go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)?--What would be the end of
it? Ruin;--yes, but there were worse things than ruin. And a short
time since he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had been so fortunate;--had made himself so safe! As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) looked back at it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) could hardly say how it had come to pass
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had been driven out of the track that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had laid down for
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had known that ruin would come, and had made himself so
comfortably safe, so brilliantly safe, in spite of ruin. But insane
ambition had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) anchorage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) told himself over
and over again that the fault had been not in circumstances,--not
in that which men call Fortune,--but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) own incapacity to bear
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) saw it now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) felt it now. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) could only begin
again, how different would his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) conduct be!

<p/>But of what avail were such regrets as these? He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) must take things as
they were now, and see that, in dealing with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) allowed himself
to be carried away neither by pride nor cowardice. And if the worst
should come to the worst, then let him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) face it like a man! There was
a certain manliness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) which showed itself perhaps as strongly
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) own self-condemnation as in any other part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) conduct at
this time. Judging of himself, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) were standing outside
himself and looking on to another man's work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) pointed out to
himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) own shortcomings. If it were all to be done again he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) could avoid this bump against the rocks on one side,
and that terribly shattering blow on the other. There was much that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was ashamed of,--many a little act which recurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) vividly
in this solitary hour as a thing to be repented of with inner
sackcloth and ashes. But never once, not for a moment, did it occur
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) should repent of the fraud in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) whole life had
been passed. No idea ever crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) mind of what might have been
the result had he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) lived the life of an honest man. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was
inquiring into himself as closely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) never even told
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had been dishonest. Fraud and dishonesty had been the
very principle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) life, and had so become a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) blood and
bones that even in this extremity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) misery he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) made no question
within himself as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) right judgment in regard to them. Not
to cheat, not to be a scoundrel, not to live more luxuriously
than others by cheating more brilliantly, was a condition of
things to which his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) mind had never turned itself. In that respect
he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) accused himself of no want of judgment. But why had he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), so
unrighteous himself, not made friends to himself of the Mammon of
unrighteousness? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) not conciliated Lord Mayors? Why had
he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) trod upon all the corns of all his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) neighbours? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) been
insolent at the India Office? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) trusted any man as he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) had
trusted Cohenlupe? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) not stuck to Abchurch Lane instead of
going into Parliament? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) called down unnecessary notice on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) head by entertaining the Emperor of China? It was too late now,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) must bear it; but these were the things that had ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) walked into Palace Yard and across it, to the door of Westminster
Abbey, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) found out that Parliament was not sitting. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
Wednesday! Of course it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) said, turning round and directing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) steps towards Grosvenor Square. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) remembered that in the
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) had declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) purpose of dining at home, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) did
not know what better use to make of the present evening. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) house
could hardly be very comfortable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>). Marie no doubt would keep
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) did not habitually receive much pleasure from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) wife's company. But in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) own house he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) could at least be alone.
Then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) walked slowly across the park, thinking so intently on
matters as hardly to observe whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) himself were observed or no,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) asked himself whether it still might not be best for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) to keep
the money which was settled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) daughter, to tell the Longestaffes
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lane</b></font>) could make no payment, and to face the worst that Mr.
Squercum could do to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>),--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) knew already how busy Mr. Squercum
was in the matter. Though they should put him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) trial for
forgery, what of that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had heard of trials in which the accused
criminals had been heroes to the multitude while their cases were in
progress,--who had been fêted from the beginning to the end though
no one had doubted their guilt,--and who had come out unscathed at
the last. What evidence had they against him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)? It might be that the
Longestaffes and Bideawhiles and Squercums should know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) was
a forger, but their knowledge would not produce a verdict. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>), as
member for Westminster, as the man who had entertained the Emperor,
as the owner of one of the most gorgeous houses in London, as the
great Melmotte, could certainly command the best half of the bar.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) already felt what popular support might do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Surely there
need be no despondency while so good a hope remained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did
tremble as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) remembered Dolly Longestaffe's letter, and the letter
of the old man who was dead. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that it was possible that
other things might be adduced; but would it not be better to face it
all than surrender his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money and become a pauper, seeing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
very clearly, that even by such surrender he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not cleanse his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
character?

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given those forged documents into the hands of Mr.
Brehgert! Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had acted in a hurry,--without giving sufficient
thought to the matter in hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was angry with himself for that
also. But how is a man to give sufficient thought to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs
when no step that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes can be other than ruinous? Yes;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
certainly put into Brehgert's hands means of proving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have
been absolutely guilty of forgery. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not think that Marie would
disclaim the signatures, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had refused to sign the
deeds, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) should understand that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
name; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) think that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) clerk would be urgent against him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
as the forgery of Croll's name could not injure Croll. But Brehgert,
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) discover what had been done, would certainly not permit him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
to escape. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had put these forgeries without any guard into
Brehgert's hands.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would tell Brehgert in the morning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) mind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would see Brehgert before any action could have been taken on the
documents, and Brehgert would no doubt restore them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
would instruct his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) daughter to hold the money fast, to sign no paper
that should be put before her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and to draw the income herself. Having
done that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would let his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) foes do their worst. They might drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
to gaol. They probably would do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) could not
be admitted to bail if accused of forgery. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would bear all
that. If convicted he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would bear the punishment, still hoping that
an end might come. But how great was the chance that they might
fail to convict him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)! As to the dead man's letter, and as to Dolly
Longestaffe's letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not think that any sufficient evidence
could be found. The evidence as to the deeds by which Marie was to
have released the property was indeed conclusive; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might still recover those documents. For the present it
must be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty to do nothing,--when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have recovered and
destroyed those documents,--and to live before the eyes of men as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feared nothing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dined at home alone, in the study, and after dinner carefully
went through various bundles of papers, preparing them for the eyes
of those ministers of the law who would probably before long have
the privilege of searching them. At dinner, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thus
employed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drank a bottle of champagne,--feeling himself greatly
comforted by the process. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only hold up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and look
men in the face, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might still live through it all.
How much had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own unassisted powers! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once been
imprisoned for fraud at Hamburgh, and had come out of gaol a pauper;
friendless, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wretched antecedents against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
a member of the British House of Parliament, the undoubted owner of
perhaps the most gorgeously furnished house in London, a man with an
established character for high finance,--a commercial giant whose
name was a familiar word on all the exchanges of the two hemispheres.
Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should be condemned to penal servitude for life, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
would not all die. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) rang the bell and desired that Madame Melmotte
might be sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and bade the servant bring him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) brandy.

<p/>In ten minutes his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) poor wife came crawling into the room. Every one
connected with Melmotte regarded the man with a certain amount of
awe,--every one except Marie, to whom alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had at times been
himself almost gentle. The servants all feared him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife
obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) implicitly when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not keep away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came
in now and stood opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never
sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) presence in that room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Marie
kept their jewelry;--for during the last twelvemonths rich trinkets
had been supplied to both of them. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered by another
question. <div class="bookquote">``Is anything going to happen, Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good deal is going to happen. Are they here in this house, or in
Grosvenor Square?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then have them all packed up,--as small as you can; never mind about
wool and cases and all that. Have them close to your hand so that if
you have to move you can take them with you. Do you understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you speak, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is going to happen, Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I tell? You ought to know by this time that when a man's
work is such as mine, things will happen. You'll be safe enough.
Nothing can hurt you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can they hurt you, Melmotte?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurt me! I don't know what you call hurting. Whatever there is to be
borne, I suppose it is I must bear it. I have not had it very soft
all my life hitherto, and I don't think it's going to be very soft
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we have to move?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely. Move! What's the harm of moving? You talk of moving as
though that were the worst thing that could happen. How would you
like to be in some place where they wouldn't let you move?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they going to send you to prison?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Melmotte;--are they going to?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Then the poor woman did sit
down, overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't ask you to come here for a scene,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte. <div class="bookquote">``Do as I
bid you about your own jewels, and Marie's. The thing is to have them
in small compass, and that you should not have it to do at the last
moment, when you will be flurried and incapable. Now you needn't
stay any longer, and it's no good asking any questions because I
shan't answer them.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>So dismissed, the poor woman crept out again,
and immediately, after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own slow fashion, went to work with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
ornaments.

<p/>Melmotte sat up during the greater part of the night, sometimes
sipping brandy and water, and sometimes smoking. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did no work,
and hardly touched a paper after his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife left him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXII.

<p/>MARIE``S PERSEVERANCE.


<p/>Very early the next morning, very early that is for London life,
Melmotte was told by a servant that Mr. Croll had called and wanted
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Then it immediately became a question with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wanted to see Croll. <div class="bookquote">``Is it anything special?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) asked. The
man thought that it was something special, as Croll had declared
his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) purpose of waiting when told that Mr. Melmotte was not as yet
dressed. This happened at about nine o'clock in the morning. Melmotte
longed to know every detail of Croll's manner,--to know even the
servant's opinion of the clerk's manner,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not dare to ask
a question. Melmotte thought that it might be well to be gracious.
<div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has breakfasted, and if not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) something in
the study.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Croll</b></font>)</div>But Mr. Croll had breakfasted and declined any further
refreshment.

<p/>Nevertheless Melmotte had not as yet made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would
meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) clerk. His (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) clerk was his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) clerk. It might perhaps be well
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should first go into the City and send word to Croll, bidding
him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) return. Over and over again, against his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) will,
the question of flying would present itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>); but, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)
discussed it within his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own bosom in every form, he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)
could not fly. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) ground,--as most assuredly he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)
would do,--then must he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) not be afraid to meet any man, let the man
come with what thunderbolts in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might. Of course sooner
or later some man must come with a thunderbolt,--and why not Croll
as well as another? He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) stood against a press in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) chamber, with a
razor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) hand, and steadied himself. How easily might he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) put an
end to it all! Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) rang his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) bell and desired that Croll might be
shown up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) room.

<p/>The three or four minutes which intervened seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) to be very
long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had absolutely forgotten in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) anxiety that the lather was
still upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) face. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) could not smother his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) anxiety. He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) was
fighting with it at every turn, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) could not conquer it. When
the knock came at his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) grasped at his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own breast as though
to support himself. With a hoarse voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) told the man to come in,
and Croll himself appeared, opening the door gently and very slowly.
Melmotte had left the bag which contained the papers in possession
of Mr. Brehgert, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) now saw, at a glance, that Croll had got the
bag in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) hand,--and could see also by the shape of the bag that the
bag contained the papers. The man therefore had in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hands, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own keeping, the very documents to which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own name had been
forged! There was no longer a hope, no longer a chance that Croll
should be ignorant of what had been done. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Croll,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) said
with an attempt at a smile, <div class="bookquote">``what brings you here so early?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) was
pale as death, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) struggle as he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) would, could not restrain
himself from trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Herr Brehgert vas vid me last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>said Croll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) thought I had better bring these back to you. That's all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>Croll spoke in a very low voice, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) eyes fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) master's
face, but with nothing of a threat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) attitude or manner.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) thought I had better bring these back to you.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>repeated Melmotte. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might have saved himself from
all coming evils by a bold demeanour at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could not
assume it. But it all flashed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) at a moment. Brehgert had seen
Croll after he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>), Melmotte, had left the City, had then discovered
the forgery, and had taken this way of sending back all the forged
documents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had known Brehgert to be of all men who ever lived the
most good-natured, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) could hardly believe in pure good-nature
such as this. It seemed that the thunderbolt was not yet to fall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brehgert came to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>continued Croll, <div class="bookquote">``because one signature
was wanting. It was very late, so I took them home with me. I said
I'd bring them to you in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div><p/>They both knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had forged the documents, Brehgert and Croll;
but how would that concern him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>), Melmotte, if these two friends had
resolved together that they would not expose him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had desired
to get the documents back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own hands, and here they were!
Melmotte's immediate trouble arose from the difficulty of speaking
in a proper manner to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own servant who had just detected him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
in forgery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) couldn't speak. There were no words appropriate to
such an occasion. <div class="bookquote">``It vas a strong order, Mr. Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>said Croll.
Melmotte tried to smile but only grinned. <div class="bookquote">``I vill not be back in the
Lane, Mr. Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not back at the office, Croll?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tink not;--no. De leetle money coming to me, you will send it.
Adieu.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Croll</b></font>)</div>And so Mr. Croll took his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) final leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) old master after
an intercourse which had lasted twenty years. We may imagine that
Herr Croll found his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) spirits to be oppressed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) capacity for
business to be obliterated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) patron's misfortunes rather than by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) patron's guilt. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had not behaved unkindly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had merely
remarked that the forgery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own name half-a-dozen times over was
a <div class="bookquote">``strong order.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Melmotte opened the bag, and examined the documents one by one. It
had been necessary that Marie should sign her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) name some half-dozen
times, and Marie's father had made all the necessary forgeries. It
had been of course necessary that each name should be witnessed;--but
here the forger had scamped his (<font color='blue'><b>forger</b></font>) work. Croll's name he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had written
five times; but one forged signature he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had left unattested! Again
he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had himself been at fault. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had aided his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own ruin by his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)
own carelessness. One seems inclined to think sometimes that any fool
might do an honest business. But fraud requires a man to be alive and
wide awake at every turn!

<p/>Melmotte had desired to have the documents back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own hands, and
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had them. Did it matter much that Brehgert and Croll both knew
the crime which he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had committed? Had they meant to take legal steps
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) they would not have returned the forgeries to his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own
hands. Brehgert, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) thought, would never tell the tale,--unless there
should arise some most improbable emergency in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) might make
money by telling it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was by no means so sure of Croll. Croll
had signified his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) intention of leaving Melmotte's service, and would
therefore probably enter some rival service, and thus become an enemy
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) late master. There could be no reason why Croll should keep
the secret. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) got no direct profit by telling it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) would
curry favour by making it known. Of course Croll would tell it.

<p/>But what harm could the telling of such a secret do him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)? The girl was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own daughter! The money had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own money! The man had been
his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own servant! There had been no fraud; no robbery; no purpose of
peculation. Melmotte, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought of this, became almost proud of
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had done, thinking that if the evidence were suppressed the
knowledge of the facts could do him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) no harm. But the evidence must be
suppressed, and with the view of suppressing it he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took the little
bag and all the papers down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to the study. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
breakfast,--and suppressed the evidence by the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) gas lamp.

<p/>When this was accomplished he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hesitated as to the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had now given up all idea of raising the money
for Longestaffe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had even considered the language in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
would explain to the assembled gentlemen on the morrow the fact that
a little difficulty still presented itself, and that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could not
exactly name a day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must leave the matter in their hands. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would not evade the meeting. Cohenlupe had gone
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) promise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) would throw all the blame on
Cohenlupe. Everybody knows that when panics arise the breaking of one
merchant causes the downfall of another. Cohenlupe should bear the
burden. But as that must be so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) could do no good by going into
the City. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) pecuniary downfall had now become too much a matter of
certainty to be staved off by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) presence; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) personal security
could hardly be assisted by it. There would be nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) to do.
Cohenlupe had gone. Miles Grendall had gone. Croll had gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) could
hardly go to Cuthbert's Court and face Mr. Brehgert! He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would stay
at home till it was time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) to go down to the House, and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would face the world there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would dine down at the House, and
stand about in the smoking-room with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) hat on, and be visible in
the lobbies, and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) seat among his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) brother legislators,--and,
if it were possible, rise on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) legs and make a speech to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
was about to have a crushing fall,--but the world should say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
had fallen like a man.

<p/>About eleven his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) daughter came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) sat in the study. It
can hardly be said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had ever been kind to Marie, but perhaps
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was the only person who in the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) career had
received indulgence at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had often beaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had
also often made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) presents and smiled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and in the periods of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) opulence, had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) pocket-money almost without limit. Now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had not only disobeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>), but by most perverse obstinacy on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) part had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) to acts of forgery which had already been
detected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had cause to be angry now with Marie if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had ever had
cause for anger. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had almost forgotten the transaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had
at any rate forgotten the violence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) own feelings at the time of
its occurrence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was no longer anxious that the release should be
made, and therefore no longer angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) refusal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, coming very gently into the room, <div class="bookquote">``I think that
perhaps I was wrong yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you were wrong;--but it doesn't matter now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you wish it I'll sign those papers. I don't suppose Lord
Nidderdale means to come any more;--and I'm sure I don't care whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) does or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you think that, Marie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was out last night at Lady Julia Goldsheiner's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was there.
I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) doesn't mean to come here any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) uncivil to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O dear no. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)'s never uncivil. But I'm sure of it. Never mind how.
I never told him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) that I cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) and I never did care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>).
Papa, is there something going to happen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some misfortune! Oh, papa, why didn't you let me marry that other
man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a penniless adventurer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have had this money that I call my money, and then
there would have been enough for us all. Papa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) would marry me
still if you would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) since you went to Liverpool?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a line.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what makes you think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would marry you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would if I got hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and told him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is a baronet. And
there would be plenty of money for us all. And we could go and live
in Germany.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We could do that just as well without your marrying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I suppose, papa, I am to be considered as somebody. I don't want
after all to run away from London, just as if everybody had turned up
their noses at me. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), and I don't like anybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) wouldn't take the trouble to go to Liverpool with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) got tipsy. I know all about that. I don't mean to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s
anything particularly grand. I don't know that anybody is very grand.
He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s as good as anybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be done, Marie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't it be done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are a dozen reasons. Why should my money be given up to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?
And it is too late. There are other things to be thought of now than
marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't want me to sign the papers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I haven't got the papers. But I want you to remember that the
money is mine and not yours. It may be that much may depend on you,
and that I shall have to trust to you for nearly everything. Do not
let me find myself deceived by my daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't,--if you'll let me see Sir Felix Carbury once more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the father's pride again reasserted itself and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) became angry.
<div class="bookquote">``I tell you, you little fool, that it is out of the question. Why
cannot you believe me? Has your mother spoken to you about your
jewels? Get them packed up, so that you can carry them away in your
hand if we have to leave this suddenly. You are an idiot to think of
that young man. As you say, I don't know that any of them are very
good, but among them all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is about the worst. Go away and do as I
bid you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>That afternoon the page in Welbeck Street came up to Lady Carbury and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that there was a young lady down-stairs who wanted to see
Sir Felix. At this time the dominion of Sir Felix in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother's
house had been much curtailed. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) latch-key had been surreptitiously
taken away from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and all messages brought for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
hands through those of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother. The plasters were not removed from
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was still subject to that loss of self-assertion
with which we are told that hitherto dominant cocks become afflicted
when they have been daubed with mud. Lady Carbury asked sundry
questions about the lady, suspecting that Ruby Ruggles, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
had heard, had come to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) lover. The page could give no special
description, merely saying that the young lady wore a black veil.
Lady Carbury directed that the young lady should be shown into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
own presence,--and Marie Melmotte was ushered into the room. <div class="bookquote">``I dare
say you don't remember me, Lady Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie said. <div class="bookquote">``I am Marie
Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>At first Lady Carbury had not recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) visitor;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did so
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Melmotte, I remember you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I am Mr. Melmotte's daughter. How is your son? I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is
better. They told me he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had been horribly used by a dreadful man in
the street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Miss Melmotte. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is getting better.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Now Lady Carbury
had heard within the last two days from Mr. Broune that <div class="bookquote">``it was all
over''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>with Melmotte. Broune had declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) very strong belief, his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
thorough conviction, that Melmotte had committed various forgeries,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) speculations had gone so much against him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) a
ruined man, and, in short, that the great Melmotte bubble was on the
very point of bursting. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody says that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'ll be in gaol before
a week is over.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>That was the information which had reached Lady
Carbury about the Melmottes only on the previous evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. Lady Carbury, hardly knowing what
answer to make, was silent for a while. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) told you
everything;--didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? You know that we were to have been married?
I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) very much, and so I do still. I am not ashamed of coming
and telling you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was all off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said so. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) say so? Your daughter came to me and was
very good to me. I do so love her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said that it was all over; but
perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was wrong. It shan't be all over if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will be true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Carbury was taken greatly by surprise. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at
the moment that this young lady, knowing that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own father was
ruined, was looking out for another home, and was doing so with
a considerable amount of audacity. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave Marie little credit
either for affection or for generosity; but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was unwilling to
answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) roughly. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that it would not be
suitable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should it not be suitable? They can't take my money away. There
is enough for all of us even if papa wanted to live with us;--but
it is mine. It is ever so much;--I don't know how much, but a great
deal. We should be quite rich enough. I ain't a bit ashamed to come
and tell you, because we were engaged. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) isn't rich, and I
should have thought it would be suitable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>It then occurred to Lady Carbury that if this were true the marriage
after all might be suitable. But how was she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to find out whether it
was true? <div class="bookquote">``I understand that your papa is opposed to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is;--but papa can't prevent me, and papa can't make me give
up the money. It's ever so many thousands a year, I know. If I can
dare to do it, why can't he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Carbury was so beside herself with doubts, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found it
impossible to form any decision. It would be necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
should see Mr. Broune. What to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son, how to bestow him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),
in what way to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) so that in ridding herself of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
might not aid in destroying him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),--this was the great trouble of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
life, the burden that was breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) back. Now this girl was not
only willing but persistently anxious to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) black sheep and to
endow him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),--as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) declared,--with ever so many thousands a year. If
the thousands were there,--or even an income of a single thousand
a year,--then what a blessing would such a marriage be! Sir Felix
had already fallen so low that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) behalf would not
be justified in declining a connection with the Melmottes because
the Melmottes had fallen. To get any niche in the world for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might live with comparative safety would now be to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a
heaven-sent comfort. <div class="bookquote">``My son is up-stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I will go up
and speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) I am here and that I have said that I will forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
everything, and that I love him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) still, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will be true to
me, I will be true to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't go down to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, <div class="bookquote">``with my face all in
this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would mind that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't do it. Besides, I don't believe about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) money. I never
did believe it. That was the real reason why I didn't go to
Liverpool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I would see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) if I were you, Felix. We could find out to
a certainty about her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) fortune. It is evident at any rate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) is
very fond of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the use of that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is ruined?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would not go down to
see the girl,--because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could not endure to expose his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face, and
was ashamed of the wounds which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had received in the street. As
regarded the money he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) half-believed and half-disbelieved Marie's
story. But the fruition of the money, if it were within his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) reach,
would be far off and to be attained with much trouble; whereas the
nuisance of a scene with Marie would be immediate. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) kiss
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) future bride, with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) nose bound up with a bandage?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) oughtn't to have come. I should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) just that. You might
send the maid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) that you couldn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>But Lady Carbury could not treat the girl after that fashion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
returned to the drawing-room, descending the stairs very slowly, and
thinking what answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would make. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``my
son feels that everything has been so changed since he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and you last
met, that nothing can be gained by a renewal of your acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) message;--is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury remained silent. <div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
is indeed all that they have told me; and I am ashamed that I should
have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). I am ashamed;--not of coming here, although you will
think that I have run after him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). I don't see why a girl should not
run after a man if they have been engaged together. But I'm ashamed
of thinking so much of so mean a person. Good-bye, Lady Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Miss Melmotte. I don't think you should be angry with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--no. I am not angry with you. You can forget me now as soon as
you please, and I will try to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then with a rapid step she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) walked back to Bruton Street, going
round by Grosvenor Square and in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) old house on the way.
What should she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) now do with herself? What sort of life should she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
endeavour to prepare for herself? The life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had led for the
last year had been thoroughly wretched. The poverty and hardship
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) remembered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) early days had been more endurable. The
servitude to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been subjected before she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had learned by
intercourse with the world to assert herself, had been preferable. In
these days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) grandeur, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had danced with princes, and
seen an emperor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) father's house, and been affianced to lords,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had encountered degradation which had been abominable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had really loved;--but had found out that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) golden idol was made
of the basest clay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had then declared to herself that bad as the
clay was she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would still love it;--but even the clay had turned away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) and had refused her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) love!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was well aware that some catastrophe was about to happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
father. Catastrophes had happened before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been conscious
of their coming. But now the blow would be a very heavy blow. They
would again be driven to pack up and move and seek some other
city,--probably in some very distant part. But go where she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would now be her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own mistress. That was the one resolution she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
succeeded in forming before she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) re-entered the house in Bruton
Street.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXIII.

<p/>MELMOTTE AGAIN AT THE HOUSE.


<p/>On that Thursday afternoon it was known everywhere that there was to
be a general ruin of all the Melmotte affairs. As soon as Cohenlupe
had gone, no man doubted. The City men who had not gone to the dinner
prided themselves on their foresight, as did also the politicians
who had declined to meet the Emperor of China at the table of the
suspected Financier. They who had got up the dinner and had been
instrumental in taking the Emperor to the house in Grosvenor Square,
and they also who had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) forward at Westminster and had
fought his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) battle for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>), were aware that they would have to defend
themselves against heavy attacks. No one now had a word to say in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) favour, or a doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) guilt. The Grendalls had retired
altogether out of town, and were no longer even heard of. Lord Alfred
had not been seen since the day of the dinner. The Duchess of Albury,
too, went into the country some weeks earlier than usual, quelled, as
the world said, by the general Melmotte failure. But this departure
had not as yet taken place at the time at which we have now arrived.

<p/>When the Speaker took his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) seat in the House, soon after four o'clock,
there were a great many members present, and a general feeling
prevailed that the world was more than ordinarily alive because
of Melmotte and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) failures. It had been confidently asserted
throughout the morning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would be put upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) trial for
forgery in reference to the purchase of the Pickering property from
Mr. Longestaffe, and it was known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had not as yet shown
himself anywhere on this day. People had gone to look at the house
in Grosvenor Square,--not knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was still living in Mr.
Longestaffe's house in Bruton Street, and had come away with the
impression that the desolation of ruin and crime was already plainly
to be seen upon it. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lupton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lupton to Mr.
Beauchamp Beauclerk in one of the lobbies of the House.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hasn't been in the City all day. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s in
Longestaffe's house. That poor fellow has got it heavy all round. The
man has got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place in the country and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house in town. There's
Nidderdale. I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks about it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is awful;--ain't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It might have been worse, I should say, as far as you are
concerned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lupton</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Lupton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes. But I'll tell you what, Lupton. I don't quite understand
it all yet. Our lawyer said three days ago that the money was
certainly there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Cohenlupe was certainly here three days ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupton/Lionel Lupton</b></font>)</div>said Lupton;--<div class="bookquote">``but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>) isn't here now. It seems to me that it has just happened in time
for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupton/Lionel Lupton</b></font>)</div>Lord Nidderdale shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) head and tried to look very
grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Sir Orlando Drought, hurrying up to the
commercial gentleman whose mistakes about finance Mr. Melmotte on a
previous occasion had been anxious to correct. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)'ll be able to tell
us where he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) is. It was rumoured, you know, an hour ago, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was
off to the continent after Cohenlupe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brown/Brown</b></font>)</div>But Mr. Brown shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) head.
Mr. Brown didn't know anything. But Mr. Brown was very strongly of
opinion that the police would know all that there was to be known
about Mr. Melmotte before this time on the following day. Mr. Brown
had been very bitter against Melmotte since that memorable attack
made upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) in the House.

<p/>Even ministers as they sat to be badgered by the ordinary
question-mongers of the day were more intent upon Melmotte than
upon their own defence. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know anything about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div>asked the
Chancellor of the Exchequer of the Secretary of State for the Home
Department.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand that no order has been given for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) arrest. There is
a general opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) has committed forgery; but I doubt whether
they've got their evidence together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)'s a ruined man, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Chancellor</b></font>)</div>said the Chancellor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) ever was a rich man. But I'll tell you what;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has been about the grandest rogue we've seen yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have spent
over a hundred thousand pounds during the last twelve months on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
personal expenses. I wonder how the Emperor will like it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)
learns the truth.''  (<font color='red'><b>Another minister</b></font>)</div>Another minister sitting close to the Secretary of
State was of opinion that the Emperor of China would not care half so
much about it as our own First Lord of the Treasury.

<p/>At this moment there came a silence over the House which was almost
audible. They who know the sensation which arises from the continued
hum of many suppressed voices will know also how plain to the
ear is the feeling caused by the discontinuance of the sound.
Everybody looked up, but everybody looked up in perfect silence. An
Under-Secretary of State had just got upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) legs to answer a most
indignant question as to an alteration of the colour of the facings
of a certain regiment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) prepared answer to which, however, was so
happy as to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to anticipate quite a little triumph. It is not
often that such a Godsend comes in the way of an under-secretary; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was intent upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) performance. But even he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was startled into
momentary oblivion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) well-arranged point. Augustus Melmotte, the
member for Westminster, was walking up the centre of the House.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had succeeded by this time in learning so much of the forms of
the House as to know what to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat,--when to wear it, and
when to take it off,--and how to sit down. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) entered by the door
facing the Speaker, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat on one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head, as was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) custom. Much of the arrogance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) appearance had come from
this habit, which had been adopted probably from a conviction that it
added something to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) powers of self-assertion. At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
was more determined than ever that no one should trace in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) outer
gait or in any feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face any sign of that ruin which, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) well knew, all men were anticipating. Therefore, perhaps, his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat
was a little more cocked than usual, and the lapels of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) coat were
thrown back a little wider, displaying the large jewelled studs which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wore in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) shirt; and the arrogance conveyed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mouth and
chin was specially conspicuous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had come down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brougham, and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had walked up Westminster Hall and entered the House by the
private door of the members, and then made his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) way in across the
great lobby and between the doorkeepers,--no one had spoken a word
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had of course seen many whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had known. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had indeed
known nearly all whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had seen;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been aware, from the
beginning of this enterprise of the day, that men would shun him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must bear their cold looks and colder silence without seeming
to notice them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had schooled himself to the task, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was now
performing it. It was not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have to move among men
without being noticed, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must endure to pass the whole
evening in the same plight. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was resolved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was now doing
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bowed to the Speaker with more than usual courtesy, raising
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat with more than usual care, and seated himself, as usual,
on the third opposition-bench, but with more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) usual fling.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was a big man, who always endeavoured to make an effect by
deportment, and was therefore customarily conspicuous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
movements. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was desirous now of being as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was always, neither
more nor less demonstrative;--but, as a matter of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
exceeded; and it seemed to those who looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that there was a
special impudence in the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) walked up the House and
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) seat. The Under-Secretary of State, who was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Under-Secretary</b></font>) legs, was
struck almost dumb, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Under-Secretary</b></font>) morsel of wit about the facings was lost
to Parliament for ever.

<p/>That unfortunate young man, Lord Nidderdale, occupied the seat next
to that on which Melmotte had placed himself. It had so happened
three or four times since Melmotte had been in the House, as the
young lord, fully intending to marry the Financier's daughter, had
resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would not be ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father-in-law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had understood that countenance of the sort which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) as a young
aristocrat could give to the man of millions who had risen no one
knew whence, was part of the bargain in reference to the marriage,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was gifted with a mingled honesty and courage which together
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) willing and able to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had given
Melmotte little lessons as to ordinary forms of the House, and had
done what in him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) lay to earn the money which was to be forthcoming.
But it had become manifest both to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father during the
last two days,--very painfully manifest to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father,--that the
thing must be abandoned. And if so,--then why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) be any longer
gracious to Melmotte? And, moreover, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been ready to be
courteous to a very vulgar and a very disagreeable man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
anxious to extend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) civilities to one who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now assured,
had been certainly guilty of forgery. But to get up at once and leave
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat because Melmotte had placed himself by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) side, did not
suit the turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) looked round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) neighbour on the
right, with a half-comic look of misery, and then prepared himself to
bear his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) punishment, whatever it might be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been up with Marie to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--I've not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>replied the lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s always asking about you now. I hope we shall
be in our own house again next week, and then we shall be able to
make you comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Could it be possible that the man did not know that all the world
was united in accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of forgery? <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what it is,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``I think you had better see my governor again, Mr.
Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing wrong, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--I don't know. You'd better see him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). I'm going now. I only
just came down to enter an appearance.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had to cross Melmotte on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) way out, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did so Melmotte grasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) by the hand. <div class="bookquote">``Good
night, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>said Melmotte quite aloud,--in a voice much louder
than that which members generally allow themselves for conversation.
Nidderdale was confused and unhappy; but there was probably not a man
in the House who did not understand the whole thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rushed down
through the gangway and out through the doors with a hurried step,
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escaped into the lobby he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met Lionel Lupton, who, since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
little conversation with Mr. Beauclerk, had heard further news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what has happened, Nidderdale?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Melmotte, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, about Melmotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupton/Lionel Lupton</b></font>)</div>continued Lupton. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has been arrested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
own house within the last half-hour on a charge of forgery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale, <div class="bookquote">``with all my heart. If you go in
you'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sitting there as large as life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has been talking
to me as though everything were all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Compton was here not a moment ago, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Compton</b></font>) had been taken
under a warrant from the Lord Mayor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord Mayor is a member and had better come and fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>)
prisoner himself. At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>)'s there. I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>)
wasn't on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) legs before long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Melmotte kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) seat steadily till seven, at which hour the House
adjourned till nine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was one of the last to leave, and then with
a slow step,--with almost majestic steps,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) descended to the
dining-room and ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) dinner. There were many men there, and
some little difficulty about a seat. No one was very willing to make
room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) secured a place, almost jostling some
unfortunate who was there before him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). It was impossible to expel
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--almost as impossible to sit next him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Even the waiters were
unwilling to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>);--but with patience and endurance he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did at
last get his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) right, as a member of the
House of Commons, and there was no ground on which such service as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) required could be refused to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). It was not long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
the table all to himself. But of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took no apparent notice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) spoke loudly to the waiters and drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) bottle of champagne
with much apparent enjoyment. Since his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) friendly intercourse with
Nidderdale no one had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) spoken to any man.
They who watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) declared among themselves that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was happy in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) own audacity;--but in truth he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was probably at that moment the
most utterly wretched man in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have better studied
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal comfort had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed, and spent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evening
in groans and wailings. But even he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with all the world now gone
from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with nothing before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but the extremest misery which the
indignation of offended laws could inflict, was able to spend the
last moments of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) freedom in making a reputation at any rate for
audacity. It was thus that Augustus Melmotte wrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) toga around
him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) before his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) death!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went from the dining-room to the smoking-room, and there, taking
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) pocket a huge case which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) always carried, proceeded to
light a cigar about eight inches long. Mr. Brown, from the City, was
in the room, and Melmotte, with a smile and a bow, offered Mr. Brown
one of the same. Mr. Brown was a short, fat, round little man, over
sixty, who was always endeavouring to give to a somewhat commonplace
set of features an air of importance by the contraction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) lips
and the knitting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) brows. It was as good as a play to see Mr.
Brown jumping back from any contact with the wicked one, and putting
on a double frown as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) looked at the impudent sinner. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't
think so much, you know, of what I said the other night. I didn't
mean any offence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div>So spoke Melmotte, and then laughed with a loud,
hoarse laugh, looking round upon the assembled crowd as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
were enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) triumph.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sat after that and smoked in silence. Once again he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) burst out
into a laugh, as though peculiarly amused with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own thoughts;--as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were declaring to himself with much inward humour that all
these men around him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were fools for believing the stories which they
had heard; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) made no further attempt to speak to any one. Soon
after nine he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went back again into the House, and again took his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) old
place. At this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had swallowed three glasses of brandy and
water, as well as the champagne, and was brave enough almost for
anything. There was some debate going on in reference to the game
laws,--a subject on which Melmotte was as ignorant as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own
housemaids,--but, as some speaker sat down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) jumped up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) legs.
Another gentleman had also risen, and when the House called to that
other gentleman Melmotte gave way. The other gentleman had not much
to say, and in a few minutes Melmotte was again on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) legs. Who
shall dare to describe the thoughts which would cross the august mind
of a Speaker of the House of Commons at such a moment? Of Melmotte's
villainy he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had no official knowledge. And even could he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) have had
such knowledge it was not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to act upon it. The man was a
member of the House, and as much entitled to speak as another. But
it seemed on that occasion that the Speaker was anxious to save the
House from disgrace;--for twice and thrice he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) refused to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``eye caught''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by the member for Westminster. As long as any other
member would rise he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) would not have his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) eye caught. But Melmotte was
persistent, and determined not to be put down. At last no one else
would speak, and the House was about to negative the motion without
a division,--when Melmotte was again on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) legs, still persisting.
The Speaker scowled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) and leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) chair. Melmotte
standing erect, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) head round from one side of the House
to another, as though determined that all should see his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) audacity,
propping himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knees against the seat before him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), remained
for half a minute perfectly silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was drunk,--but better able
than most drunken men to steady himself, and showing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) face
none of those outward signs of intoxication by which drunkenness is
generally made apparent. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had forgotten in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) audacity that
words are needed for the making of a speech, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not a
word at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) command. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) stumbled forward, recovered himself, then
looked once more round the House with a glance of anger, and after
that toppled headlong forward over the shoulders of Mr. Beauchamp
Beauclerk, who was now sitting in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>) might have wrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>) toga around him (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>) better perhaps had he (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>)
remained at home, but if to have himself talked about was his (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>) only
object, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>) could hardly have taken a surer course. The scene, as it
occurred, was one very likely to be remembered when the performer
should have been carried away into enforced obscurity. There was much
commotion in the House. Mr. Beauclerk, a man of natural good nature,
though at the moment put to considerable personal inconvenience,
hastened, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>) recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>) own equilibrium, to assist the
drunken man. But Melmotte had by no means lost the power of helping
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) quickly recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) legs, and then reseating himself,
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hat on, and endeavoured to look as though nothing special had
occurred. The House resumed its business, taking no further notice of
Melmotte, and having no special rule of its own as to the treatment
to be adopted with drunken members. But the member for Westminster
caused no further inconvenience. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) seat for perhaps
ten minutes, and then, not with a very steady step, but still with
capacity sufficient for his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own guidance, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) way down to the
doors. His (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) exit was watched in silence, and the moment was an anxious
one for the Speaker, the clerks, and all who were near him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>)
fallen some one,--or rather some two or three,--must have picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>)
up and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) out. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) did not fall either there or in the
lobbies, or on his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) way down to Palace Yard. Many were looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>),
but none touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) had got through the gates, leaning
against the wall he (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) hallooed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) brougham, and the servant who
was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) soon took him (<font color='blue'><b>Speaker</b></font>) home to Bruton Street. That was
the last which the British Parliament saw of its new member for
Westminster.

<p/>Melmotte as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) reached home got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own sitting-room
without difficulty, and called for more brandy and water. Between
eleven and twelve he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was left there by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) servant with a bottle
of brandy, three or four bottles of soda-water, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) cigar-case.
Neither of the ladies of the family came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) speak of
them. Nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) so drunk then as to give rise to any suspicion in
the mind of the servant. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was habitually left there at night, and
the servant as usual went to his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) bed. But at nine o'clock on the
following morning the maid-servant found him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) dead upon the floor.
Drunk as he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) had been,--more drunk as he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) probably became during the
night,--still he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) was able to deliver himself from the indignities
and penalties to which the law might have subjected him (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) by a dose of
prussic acid.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXIV.

<p/>PAUL MONTAGUE``S VINDICATION.


<p/>It is hoped that the reader need hardly be informed that Hetta
Carbury was a very miserable young woman as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) decided that
duty compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to divide herself altogether from Paul Montague.
I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was irrational; but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) it seemed that the
offence against herself,--the offence against her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own dignity as a
woman,--was too great to be forgiven. There can be no doubt that it
would all have been forgiven with the greatest ease had Paul told the
story before it had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) ears from any other source. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),--when her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) heart was softest towards him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>),--I once loved
another woman, and that woman is here now in London, a trouble to me,
persecuting me, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) history is so and so, and the history of my
love for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was after this fashion, and the history of my declining
love is after that fashion, and of this at any rate you may be sure,
that this woman has never been near my heart from the first moment in
which I saw you;--had he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) told it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thus, there would not have
been an opening for anger. And he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) doubtless would have so told it,
had not Hetta's brother interfered too quickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was then forced to
exculpate himself, to confess rather than to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own story,--and
to admit facts which wore the air of having been concealed, and which
had already been conceived to be altogether damning if true. It
was that journey to Lowestoft, not yet a month old, which did the
mischief,--a journey as to which Hetta was not slow in understanding
all that Roger Carbury had thought about it, though Roger would say
nothing of it to herself. Paul had been staying at the seaside with
this woman in amicable intimacy,--this horrid woman,--in intimacy
worse than amicable, and had been visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daily at Islington!
Hetta felt quite sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had never passed a day without going
there since the arrival of the woman; and everybody would know what
that meant. And during this very hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been,--well, perhaps not
exactly making love to herself, but looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and talking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and behaving to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a manner such as could not but make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) intended to make love to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Of course they had
really understood it, since they had met at Madame Melmotte's first
ball, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had made a plea that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not allow herself to
dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) more than,--say half-a-dozen times. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
not intended him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) then to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love with
favour; but equally of course she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) must so feel it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not only told herself, but had told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother, that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
heart was given away to this man; and yet the man during this very
time was spending his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hours with a--woman, with a strange American
woman, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been once engaged. How
could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? How could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refrain from telling
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that everything must be over between them? Everybody was against
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousin: and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had not a word to say in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) defence. A horrid woman! A wretched,
bad, bold American intriguing woman! It was terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that
a friend of hers should ever have attached himself to such a
creature;--but that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should have come to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a second
tale of love long, long before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had cleared himself from the
first;--perhaps with no intention of clearing himself from the first!
Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)! No;--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would never forgive
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would break her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). That was a matter of course;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would never forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew well what it was that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
mother wanted. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother thought that by forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into a quarrel
with Montague she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would force her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) also into a marriage with Roger
Carbury. But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother would find out that in that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was mistaken.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would never marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousin, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be always ready to
acknowledge his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) worth. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sure now that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would never marry
any man. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made this resolve she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a wicked satisfaction in
feeling that it would be a trouble to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother;--for though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was altogether in accord with Lady Carbury as to the iniquities of
Paul Montague she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was not the less angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) mother for being so
ready to expose those iniquities.

<p/>Oh, with what slow, cautious fingers, with what heartbroken
tenderness did she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) take out from its guardian case the brooch which
Paul had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)! It had as yet been an only present, and in
thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for it, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had done with full, free-spoken words
of love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had begged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) no other, so that that might
ever be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>),--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) dying day,--the one precious thing that had
been given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lover while she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was yet a girl. Now it must
be sent back;--and, no doubt, it would go to that abominable woman!
But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers lingered over it as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) touched it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
fain have kissed it, had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not told herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have
been disgraced, even in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) solitude, by such a demonstration of
affection. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answer to Paul Montague; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would have no further personal correspondence with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took the
brooch to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother with a request that it might be returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, my dear, I will send it back to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). Is there nothing
else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mamma;--nothing else. I have no letters, and no other present.
You always knew everything that took place. If you will just send
that back to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>),--without a word. You won't say anything,--will you,
mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing for me to say if you have really made him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) understood me, mamma. You need not doubt about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) has behaved very, very badly,--from the beginning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Carbury.

<p/>But Hetta did not really think that the young man had behaved very
badly from the beginning, and certainly did not wish to be told of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misbehaviour. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought that the young man had behaved
very well in falling in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) directly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>);--only
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had behaved so badly in taking Mrs. Hurtle to Lowestoft
afterwards! <div class="bookquote">``It's no good talking about that, mamma. I hope you will
never talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is quite unworthy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear to--have him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)--abused,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Hetta, I have no doubt this has made you for the time
unhappy. Such little accidents do make people unhappy--for the time.
But it will be much for the best that you should endeavour not to be
so sensitive about it. The world is too rough and too hard for people
to allow their feelings full play. You have to look out for the
future, and you can best do so by resolving that Paul Montague shall
be forgotten at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, don't. How is a person to resolve? Oh, mamma, don't say
any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear, there is more that I must say. Your future life is
before you, and I must think of it, and you must think of it. Of
course you must be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no of course at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you must be married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Carbury, <div class="bookquote">``and of
course it is your duty to think of the way in which this may be best
done. My income is becoming less and less every day. I already owe
money to your cousin, and I owe money to Mr. Broune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Money to Mr. Broune!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--to Mr. Broune. I had to pay a sum for Felix which Mr. Broune
told me ought to be paid. And I owe money to tradesmen. I fear that
I shall not be able to keep on this house. And they tell me,--your
cousin and Mr. Broune,--that it is my duty to take Felix out of
London,--probably abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall go with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be so at first; but, perhaps, even that may not be necessary.
Why should you? What pleasure could you have in it? Think what my
life must be with Felix in some French or German town!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, why don't you let me be a comfort to you? Why do you speak of
me always as though I were a burden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody is a burden to other people. It is the way of life. But
you,--if you will only yield in ever so little,--you may go where you
will be no burden, where you will be accepted simply as a blessing.
You have the opportunity of securing comfort for your whole life,
and of making a friend, not only for yourself, but for me and your
brother, of one whose friendship we cannot fail to want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, you cannot really mean to talk about that now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I not mean it? What is the use of indulging in high-flown
nonsense? Make up your mind to be the wife of your cousin Roger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is horrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, bursting out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) agony. <div class="bookquote">``Cannot
you understand that I am broken-hearted about Paul, that I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
from my very soul, that parting from him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) is like tearing my heart
in pieces? I know that I must, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) has behaved so very
badly,--and because of that wicked woman! And so I have. But I did
not think that in the very next hour you would bid me give myself
to somebody else! I will never marry Roger Carbury. You may be
quite--quite sure that I shall never marry any one. If you won't
take me with you when you go away with Felix, I must stay behind and
try and earn my bread. I suppose I could go out as a nurse.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then,
without waiting for a reply she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) left the room and betook herself to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own apartment.

<p/>Lady Carbury did not even understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not
conceive that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had in any way acted unkindly in taking the
opportunity of Montague's rejection for pressing the suit of the
other lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was simply anxious to get a husband for her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
daughter,--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had been anxious to get a wife for her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) son,--in
order that her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) child might live comfortably. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) felt that
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) spoke common sense to Hetta, her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) daughter took it as
an offence, and flew into tantrums, being altogether unable to
accommodate herself to the hard truths of the world. Deep as was the
sorrow which her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) son brought upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), and great as was the disgrace,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could feel more sympathy for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) than for the girl. If there was
anything that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could not forgive in life it was romance. And yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), at any rate, believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) delighted in romantic poetry! At
the present moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was very wretched; and was certainly unselfish
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) daughter comfortably settled before she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
commenced those miserable roamings with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) son which seemed to be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) coming destiny.

<p/>In these days she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) thought a good deal of Mr. Broune's offer, and of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own refusal. It was odd that since that refusal she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had seen more
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>), and had certainly known much more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had ever
seen or known before. Previous to that little episode their intimacy
had been very fictitious, as are many intimacies. They had played at
being friends, knowing but very little of each other. But now, during
the last five or six weeks,--since she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had refused his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) offer,--they
had really learned to know each other. In the exquisite misery of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) troubles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) the truth about herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) son,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had responded, not by compliments, but by real aid and true
counsel. His (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) whole tone was altered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), as was hers to him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>).
There was no longer any egregious flattery between them,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>), in
speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), would be almost rough to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). Once he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would be a fool if she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did not do so and so. The consequence
was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) almost regretted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) to escape.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) certainly made no effort to recover the lost prize, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) troubles. It was on that afternoon, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
disagreement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) daughter, that Marie Melmotte came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). And,
on that same evening, closeted with Mr. Broune in her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) back room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) of both occurrences. <div class="bookquote">``If the girl has got the money--,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
began, regretting her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) son's obstinacy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Broune. <div class="bookquote">``From all that I can
hear, I don't think that there is any money. And if there is, you may
be sure that Melmotte would not let it slip through his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) fingers in
that way. I would not have anything to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think it is all over with the Melmottes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A rumour reached me just now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been already arrested.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It
was now between nine and ten in the evening. <div class="bookquote">``But as I came away from
my room, I heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was down at the House. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) will have to
stand a trial for forgery, I think there cannot be a doubt, and I
imagine that it will be found that not a shilling will be saved out
of the property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a wonderful career it has been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,--the strangest thing that has come up in our days. I am
inclined to think that the utter ruin at this moment has been brought
about by his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) reckless personal expenditure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) spend such a lot of money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could conquer the world by it, and obtain
universal credit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) very nearly succeeded too. Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had forgotten
to calculate the force of the envy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) competitors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) has committed forgery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, I think so. Of course we know nothing as yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I suppose it is better that Felix should not have married her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly better. No redemption was to have been had on that side,
and I don't think you should regret the loss of such money as his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) head, meaning probably to imply that even
Melmotte's money would have had no bad odour to one so dreadfully in
want of assistance as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate do not think of it any
more.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) grief about Hetta. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``I feel myself less able to express an authoritative opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) doesn't owe a shilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) is really a
fine gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) doesn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) does. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) thinks him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to be the finest person in the
world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) a great deal sooner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would me. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mind stuffed with nonsense about love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great many people, Lady Carbury, have their minds stuffed with
that nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--and ruin themselves with it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) will do. Love is like any
other luxury. You have no right to it unless you can afford it. And
those who will have it when they can't afford it, will come to the
ground like this Mr. Melmotte. How odd it seems! It isn't a fortnight
since we all thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) the greatest man in London.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>Mr. Broune only
smiled, not thinking it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) while to declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had never
held that opinion about the late idol of Abchurch Lane.

<p/>On the following morning, very early, while Melmotte was still lying,
as yet undiscovered, on the floor of Mr. Longestaffe's room, a letter
was brought up to Hetta by the maid-servant, who told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that Mr.
Montague had delivered it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) took it greedily,
and then repressing herself, put it with an assumed gesture of
indifference beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) pillow. But as soon as the girl had left the
room she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at once seized her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) treasure. It never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as
yet to think whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would or would not receive a letter from
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dismissed lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) must go, and go for
ever, and had taken it for granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would do so,--probably
willingly. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would be delighted to return to the American
woman. But now that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) allowed no doubt to come
between her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and the reading of it. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was alone she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
opened it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran through its contents without allowing herself
a moment for thinking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on, whether the excuses made by
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover were or were not such as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to accept.


<p/>DEAREST HETTA,

<p/>I think you have been most unjust to me, and if you have
ever loved me I cannot understand your injustice. I have
never deceived you in anything, not by a word, or for a
moment. Unless you mean to throw me over because I did
once love another woman, I do not know what cause of anger
you have. I could not tell you about Mrs. Hurtle till you
had accepted me, and, as you yourself must know, I had had
no opportunity to tell you anything afterwards till the
story had reached your ears. I hardly know what I said the
other day, I was so miserable at your accusation. But I
suppose I said then, and I again declare now, that I had
made up my mind that circumstances would not admit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
becoming my wife before I had ever seen you, and that I
have certainly never wavered in my determination since
I saw you. I can with safety refer to Roger as to this,
because I was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) when I so determined, and made up
my mind very much at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) instance. This was before I had
ever even met you.

<p/>If I understand it all right you are angry because I have
associated with Mrs. Hurtle since I so determined. I am
not going back to my first acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) now. You
may blame me for that if you please,--though it cannot
have been a fault against you. But, after what had
occurred, was I to refuse to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) came to
England to see me? I think that would have been cowardly.
Of course I went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was all alone here,
without a single other friend, and telling me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was
unwell, and asking me to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) down to the seaside, was
I to refuse? I think that that would have been unkind. It
was a dreadful trouble to me. But of course I did it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) asked me to renew my engagement. I am bound to tell
you that, but I know in telling you that it will go no
farther. I declined, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) that it was my purpose to
ask another woman to be my wife. Of course there has been
anger and sorrow,--anger on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) part and sorrow on mine.
But there has been no doubt. And at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) yielded. As
far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was concerned my trouble was over,--except in
so far that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) unhappiness has been a great trouble to
me,--when, on a sudden, I found that the story had reached
you in such a form as to make you determined to quarrel
with me!

<p/>Of course you do not know it all, for I cannot tell you
all without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) history. But you know everything
that in the least concerns yourself, and I do say that you
have no cause whatever for anger. I am writing at night.
This evening your brooch was brought to me with three
or four cutting words from your mother. But I cannot
understand that if you really love me, you should wish to
separate yourself from me,--or that, if you ever loved me,
you should cease to love me now because of Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/>I am so absolutely confused by the blow that I hardly know
what I am writing, and take first one outrageous idea into
my head and then another. My love for you is so thorough
and so intense that I cannot bring myself to look forward
to living without you, now that you have once owned that
you have loved me. I cannot think it possible that love,
such as I suppose yours must have been, could be made to
cease all at a moment. Mine can't. I don't think it is
natural that we should be parted.

<p/>If you want corroboration of my story go yourself to Mrs.
Hurtle. Anything is better than that we both should be
broken-hearted.

<p/>Yours most affectionately,

<p/>PAUL MONTAGUE.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXV.

<p/>BREAKFAST IN BERKELEY SQUARE.


<p/>Lord Nidderdale was greatly disgusted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) own part of the
performance when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) left the House of Commons, and was, we may say,
disgusted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) own position generally, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) considered all
its circumstances. That had been at the commencement of the evening,
and Melmotte had not then been tipsy; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had behaved with
unsurpassable arrogance and vulgarity, and had made the young lord
drink the cup of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own disgrace to the very dregs. Everybody now
knew it as a positive fact that the charges made against the man were
to become matter of investigation before the chief magistrate for
the City, everybody knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had committed forgery upon forgery,
everybody knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) could not pay for the property which he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had
pretended to buy, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) was actually a ruined man;--and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>)
had seized Nidderdale by the hand, and called the young lord <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
dear boy''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>before the whole House.

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had made himself conspicuous as this man's advocate. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had not himself spoken openly of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) coming marriage with the
girl, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had allowed other men to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had
quarrelled with one man for saying that Melmotte was a rogue, and
had confidentially told his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) most intimate friends that in spite of
a little vulgarity of manner, Melmotte at bottom was a very good
fellow. How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) now to back out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) intimacy with the Melmottes
generally? He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was engaged to marry the girl, and there was nothing
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) acknowledged to himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
deserved well at his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hands. Though at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hated the father
most bitterly, as those odious words, and the tone in which they had
been pronounced, rang in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ears, nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had some kindly
feeling for the girl. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) could not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now. That was
manifestly out of the question. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) herself, as well as all others,
had known that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was to be married for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money, and now that
bubble had been burst. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) owed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as to a
comrade who had on the whole been loyal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), to have some personal
explanation with herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) arranged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own mind the sort of
speech that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would make to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of course you know it can't be.
It was all arranged because you were to have a lot of money, and now
it turns out that you haven't got any. And I haven't got any, and we
should have nothing to live upon. It's out of the question. But, upon
my word, I'm very sorry, for I like you very much, and I really think
we should have got on uncommon well together.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was the kind of
speech that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) suggested to himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not know how to find
for himself the opportunity of making it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) must put
it all into a letter. But then that would be tantamount to a written
confession that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an offer of marriage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) feared
that Melmotte,--or Madame Melmotte on his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) behalf, if the great man
himself were absent, in prison,--might make an ungenerous use of such
an admission.

<p/>Between seven and eight he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into the Beargarden, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw
Dolly Longestaffe and others. Everybody was talking about Melmotte,
the prevailing belief being that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was at this moment in custody.
Dolly was full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own griefs; but consoled amidst them by a sense
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own importance. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether it's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was saying to
Lord Grasslough. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) has an appointment to meet me and my governor
at twelve o'clock to-morrow, and to pay us what he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) owes us. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) swore
yesterday that he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would have the money to-morrow. But he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) can't keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) appointment, you know, if he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'s in prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't see the money, Dolly, you may swear to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said
Grasslough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose I shall. By George, what an ass my governor has
been. He (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) had no more right than you have to give up the property.
Here's Nidderdale. He (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) could tell us where he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) is; but I'm afraid to
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) cut up so rough the other night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In a moment the conversation was stopped; but when Lord Grasslough
asked Nidderdale in a whisper whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) knew anything about
Melmotte, the latter answered out loud, <div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I left him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) in the
House half an hour ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People are saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) has been arrested.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard that also; but he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) certainly had not been arrested when
I left the House.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) went up and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hand on Dolly
Longestaffe's shoulder, and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you were about
right the other night and I was about wrong; but you could understand
what it was that I meant. I'm afraid this is a bad look out for both
of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I understand. It's deuced bad for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``I think
you're very well out of it. But I'm glad there's not to be a quarrel.
Suppose we have a rubber of whist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Later on in the night news was brought to the club that Melmotte had
tried to make a speech in the House, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been very drunk, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had tumbled over, upsetting Beauchamp Beauclerk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) fall.
<div class="bookquote">``By George, I should like to have seen that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad I was not there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. It was three
o'clock before they left the card table, at which time Melmotte was
lying dead upon the floor in Mr. Longestaffe's house.

<p/>On the following morning, at ten o'clock, Lord Nidderdale sat at
breakfast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father in the old lord's house in Berkeley Square.
From thence the house which Melmotte had hired was not above a few
hundred yards distant. At this time the young lord was living with
his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) father, and the two had now met by appointment in order that
something might be settled between them as to the proposed marriage.
The Marquis was not a very pleasant companion when the affairs in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was interested did not go exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) would have them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
could be very cross and say most disagreeable words,--so that the
ladies of the family, and others connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), for the most
part, found it impossible to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). But his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) eldest son had
endured him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>);--partly perhaps because, being the eldest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been
treated with a nearer approach to courtesy, but chiefly by means
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own extreme good humour. What did a few hard words matter?
If his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) father was ungracious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) knew what all
that meant. As long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) father would make fair allowance for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
own peccadilloes,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) also would make allowances for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) father's
roughness. All this was based on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) grand theory of live and let
live. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) expected his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) father to be a little cross on this occasion,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) acknowledged to himself that there was cause for it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was a little late himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) father already
buttering his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) toast. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you'd get out of bed a moment
sooner than you liked if you could save the whole property by it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You show me how I can make a guinea by it, sir, and see if I don't
earn the money.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat down and poured himself out a cup of
tea, and looked at the kidneys and looked at the fish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you were drinking last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>said the old lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not particular.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man turned round and gnashed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth at
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The fact is, sir, I don't drink. Everybody knows that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know when you're in the country you can't live without champagne.
Well;--what have you got to say about all this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you got to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've made a pretty kettle of fish of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been guided by you in everything. Come, now; you ought to own
that. I suppose the whole thing is over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why it should be over. I'm told she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has got her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own
money.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Then Nidderdale described to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father Melmotte's behaviour
in the House on the preceding evening. <div class="bookquote">``What the devil does that
matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``You're not going to marry the man
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s in gaol now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does that matter? She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not in gaol. And if the money is
hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can't lose it because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes to prison. Beggars mustn't be
choosers. How do you mean to live if you don't marry this girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall scrape on, I suppose. I must look for somebody else.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Marquis</b></font>)</div>The
Marquis showed very plainly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) demeanour that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) did not give his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
son much credit either for diligence or for ingenuity in making such
a search. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate, sir, I can't marry the daughter of a man who
is to be put upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trial for forgery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see what that has to do with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't do it, sir. I'd do anything else to oblige you, but I
couldn't do that. And, moreover, I don't believe in the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you may just go to the devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the old Marquis turning
himself round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chair, and lighting a cigar as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) took up
the newspaper. Nidderdale went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) breakfast with perfect
equanimity, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had finished lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) cigar. <div class="bookquote">``They tell
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, <div class="bookquote">``that one of those Goldsheiner girls will have
a lot of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Jewess,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What difference does that make?''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``What difference does that make?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no;--not in the least;--if the money's really there. Have you
heard any sum named, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man only grunted. <div class="bookquote">``There are two
sisters and two brothers. I don't suppose the girls would have a
hundred thousand each.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say the widow of that brewer who died the other day has about
twenty thousand a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) life, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) could insure her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) life. D--me, sir, we must do something. If
you turn up your nose at one woman after another how do you mean to
live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that a woman of forty with only a life interest would
be a good speculation. Of course I'll think of it if you press it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man growled again. <div class="bookquote">``You see, sir, I've been so much in
earnest about this girl that I haven't thought of inquiring about
any one else. There always is some one up with a lot of money. It's
a pity there shouldn't be a regular statement published with the
amount of money, and what is expected in return. It 'd save a deal of
trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can't talk more seriously than that you'd better go away,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the old Marquis.

<p/>At that moment a footman came into the room and told Lord Nidderdale
that a man particularly wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not
always anxious to see those who called on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked the
servant whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew who the man was. <div class="bookquote">``I believe, my lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'s
one of the domestics from Mr. Melmotte's in Bruton Street,''  (<font color='red'><b>the footman doubt</b></font>)</div>said the
footman, who was no doubt fully acquainted with all the circumstances
of Lord Nidderdale's engagement. The son, who was still smoking,
looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father as though in doubt. <div class="bookquote">``You'd better go and see,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis. But Nidderdale before he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) went asked a question as
to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had better do if Melmotte had sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Go and see
Melmotte. Why should you be afraid to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)? Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that you are
ready to marry the girl if you can see the money down, but that you
won't stir a step till it has been actually paid over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knows that already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) left the room.

<p/>In the hall he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) found a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) recognised as Melmotte's butler, a
ponderous, elderly, heavy man who now had a letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. But
the lord could tell by the man's face and manner that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself had
some story to tell. <div class="bookquote">``Is there anything the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lord,--yes. Oh, dear,--oh, dear! I think you'll be sorry to
hear it. There was none who came there he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) seemed to take to so much
as your lordship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've taken him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to prison!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Nidderdale. But the man
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``What is it then? He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) can't be dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Then the man
nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, burst into
tears. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Melmotte dead! He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was in the House of Commons last night.
I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) myself. How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) die?''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>But the fat, ponderous man was
so affected by the tragedy he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had witnessed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not as
yet give any account of the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master's death, but simply
handed the note which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to Lord Nidderdale. It was
from Marie, and had been written within half an hour of the time at
which news had been brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) of what had occurred. The note was
as follows:--


<p/>DEAR LORD NIDDERDALE,

<p/>The man will tell you what has happened. I feel as though
I was mad. I do not know who to send to. Will you come to
me, only for a few minutes?

<p/>MARIE.


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read it standing up in the hall, and then again asked the man as
to the manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master's death. And now the Marquis, gathering
from a word or two that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) heard and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son's delay that
something special had occurred, hobbled out into the hall. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Melmotte is--dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son. The old man dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stick,
and fell back against the wall. <div class="bookquote">``This man says that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is dead, and
here is a letter from Marie asking me to go there. How was it that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--died?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was--poison,''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>said the butler solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``There has been a
doctor already, and there isn't no doubt of that. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) took it all by
himself last night. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) came home, perhaps a little fresh, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
had in brandy and soda and cigars;--and sat himself down all to
himself. Then in the morning, when the young woman went in,--there he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
was,--poisoned! I see him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lay on the ground, and I helped to lift him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
up, and there was that smell of prussic acid that I knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had
been and done just the same as when the doctor came and told us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Before the man could be allowed to go back, there was a consultation
between the father and son as to a compliance with the request which
Marie had made in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) first misery. The Marquis thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) son
had better not go to Bruton Street. <div class="bookquote">``What's the use? What good can
you do? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll only be falling into your arms, and that's what you've
got to avoid,--at any rate, till you know how things are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/>But Nidderdale's better feelings would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) to submit to
this advice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had been engaged to marry the girl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
abject misery had turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) as the friend she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew best. At any
rate for the time the heartlessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) usual life deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) felt willing to devote himself to the girl not for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
could get,--but because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had so nearly been so near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
couldn't refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) said over and over again. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't bring
myself to do it. Oh, no;--I shall certainly go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll get into a mess if you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I must get into a mess. I shall certainly go. I will go at
once. It is very disagreeable, but I cannot possibly refuse. It would
be abominable.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then going back to the hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) sent a message by the
butler to Marie, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) in less than half
an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you go and make a fool of yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) father said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was alone. <div class="bookquote">``This is just one of those times when a man may
ruin himself by being soft-hearted.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Nidderdale simply shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) head
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) hat and gloves to go across to Bruton Street.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXVI.

<p/>THE MEETING IN BRUTON STREET.


<p/>When the news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) husband's death was in some very rough way
conveyed to Madame Melmotte, it crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) for the time altogether.
Marie first heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) no longer had a living parent as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) stood
by the poor woman's bedside, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was enabled, as much perhaps by
the necessity incumbent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) of attending to the wretched woman
as by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own superior strength of character, to save herself from
that prostration and collapse of power which a great and sudden blow
is apt to produce. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) stared at the woman who first conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
tidings of the tragedy, and then for a moment seated herself at the
bedside. But the violent sobbings and hysterical screams of Madame
Melmotte soon brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) feet, and from that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
was not only active but efficacious. No;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would not go down to
the room; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could do no good by going thither. But they must send
for a doctor. They should send for a doctor immediately. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was then
told that a doctor and an inspector of police were already in the
rooms below. The necessity of throwing whatever responsibility there
might be on to other shoulders had been at once apparent to the
servants, and they had sent out right and left, so that the house
might be filled with persons fit to give directions in such an
emergency. The officers from the police station were already there
when the woman who now filled Didon's place in the house communicated
to Madame Melmotte the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a widow.

<p/>It was afterwards said by some of those who had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at the time,
that Marie Melmotte had shown a hard heart on the occasion. But the
condemnation was wrong. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father was certainly not
that which we are accustomed to see among our daughters and sisters.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) the petted divinity of the household, whose
slightest wish had been law, whose little comforts had become matters
of serious care, whose frowns were horrid clouds, whose smiles were
glorious sunshine, whose kisses were daily looked for, and if missed
would be missed with mourning. How should it have been so with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)? In all the intercourses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) family, since the first rough
usage which she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) remembered, there had never been anything sweet or
gracious. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had recognised a certain duty, as due from
herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had found herself bound to measure it,
so that more should not be exacted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) than duty required. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had long known that her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father would fain make her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) a slave for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
own purposes, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) put no limits to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own obedience he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
certainly would put none. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had drawn no comparison between him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
and other fathers, or between herself and other daughters, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had never become conversant with the ways of other families.
After a fashion she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), because nature creates love in a
daughter's heart; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had never respected him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and had spent the
best energies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) character on a resolve that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would never fear
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may cut me into pieces, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall not make me do for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
advantage that which I do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a right to exact from
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>That had been the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) mind towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father; and now
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had taken himself away with terrible suddenness, leaving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to face the difficulties of the world with no protector and no
assistance, the feeling which dominated her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was no doubt one of awe
rather than of broken-hearted sorrow. Those who depart must have
earned such sorrow before it can be really felt. They who are left
may be overwhelmed by the death--even of their most cruel tormentors.
Madame Melmotte was altogether overwhelmed; but it could not probably
be said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) with truth that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was crushed by pure grief. There
was fear of all things, fear of solitude, fear of sudden change, fear
of terrible revelations, fear of some necessary movement she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew
not whither, fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might be discovered to be a poor wretched
impostor who never could have been justified in standing in the
same presence with emperors and princes, with duchesses and cabinet
ministers. This and the fact that the dead body of the man who had so
lately been her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) tyrant was lying near her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) might hardly
dare to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) room lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should encounter him (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) dead, and thus
more dreadful even than when alive, utterly conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). Feelings
of the same kind, the same fears, and the same awe were powerful
also with Marie;--but they did not conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was strong and
conquered them; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did not care to affect a weakness to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was in truth superior. In such a household the death of such a
father after such a fashion will hardly produce that tender sorrow
which comes from real love.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) soon knew it all. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father had destroyed himself, and had
doubtless done so because his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) troubles in regard to money had been
greater than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could bear. When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was to sign
those deeds because ruin was impending, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must indeed have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had so often lied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had had no means of
knowing whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was lying then or telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) a true story. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had offered to sign the deeds since that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
that it would be of no avail,--and at that time had not been angry
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have been had her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) refusal been the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
ruin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) took some comfort in thinking of that.

<p/>But what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to do? What was to be done generally by that
over-cumbered household? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) pseudo-mother had been
instructed to pack up their jewellery, and they had both obeyed
the order. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) herself at this moment cared but little for any
property. How ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to behave herself? Where should she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) go? On
whose arm could she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lean for some support at this terrible time?
As for love, and engagements, and marriage,--that was all over. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) difficulty she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) never for a moment thought of Sir Felix Carbury.
Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been silly enough to love the man because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
pleasant to look at, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had never been so far gone in silliness
as to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a staff upon which any one might lean.
Had that marriage taken place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would have been the staff. But
it might be possible that Lord Nidderdale would help her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was
good-natured and manly, and would be efficacious,--if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would
come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was near, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought that at any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would
try. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had written her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) note and sent it by the butler,--thinking
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did so of the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would use to make the young man
understand that all the nonsense they had talked as to marrying each
other was, of course, to mean nothing now.

<p/>It was past eleven when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was shown
up-stairs into one of the sitting-rooms on the first-floor. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
passed the door of the study, which was at the moment partly open,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the dress of a policeman within, and knew that the body of
the dead man was still lying there. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went by rapidly without a
glance within, remembering the look of the man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had last seen
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) burly figure, and that grasp of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and those odious words.
And now the man was dead,--having destroyed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own life. Surely the
man must have known when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uttered those words what it was that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to do! When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made that last appeal about Marie,
conscious as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was that everyone was deserting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must even
then have looked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fate in the face and have told himself that it
was better that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should die! His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misfortunes, whatever might be
their nature, must have been heavy on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then with all their weight;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself and all the world had known that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ruined.
And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had pretended to be anxious about the girl's marriage,
and had spoken of it as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still believed that it would be
accomplished!

<p/>Nidderdale had hardly put his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) hat down on the table before Marie
was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) walked up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) by both hands, and
looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) face. There was no trace of a tear, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) whole
countenance seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) to be altered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was the first to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you would come when I sent for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you would be a friend, and I knew no one else who would. You
won't be afraid, Lord Nidderdale, that I shall ever think any more of
all those things which he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was planning?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) paused a moment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
was not ready enough to have a word to say in answer to this. <div class="bookquote">``You
know what has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your servant told us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are we to do? Oh, Lord Nidderdale, it is so dreadful! Poor
papa! Poor papa! When I think of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must have suffered I
wish that I could be dead too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has your mother been told?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knows. No one tried to conceal anything for a moment.
It was better that it should be so;--better at last. But we have
no friends who would be considerate enough to try to save us from
sorrow. But I think it was better. Mamma is very bad. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is always
nervous and timid. Of course this has nearly killed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). What ought
we to do? It is Mr. Longestaffe's house, and we were to have left it
to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) will not mind that now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where must we go? We can't go back to that big place in Grosvenor
Square. Who will manage for us? Who will see the doctor and the
policemen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there will be things that I cannot ask you to do. Why should I
ask you to do anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because we are friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``no. You cannot really regard me as a friend. I have
been an impostor. I know that. I had no business to know a person
like you at all. Oh, if the next six months could be over! Poor
papa;--poor papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then for the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I knew what might comfort you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can there be any comfort? There never can be comfort again! As
for comfort, when were we ever comfortable? It has been one trouble
after another,--one fear after another! And now we are friendless and
homeless. I suppose they will take everything that we have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your papa had a lawyer, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had ever so many,--but I do not know who they were. His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
own clerk, who had lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) for over twenty years, left him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
yesterday. I suppose they will know something in Abchurch Lane; but
now that Herr Croll has gone I am not acquainted even with the name
of one of them. Mr. Miles Grendall used to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) could be of much service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor Lord Alfred? Lord Alfred was always with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) till very lately.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Nidderdale shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose not. They only came because
papa had a big house.''  (<font color='red'><b>The lord</b></font>)</div>The young lord could not but feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
was included in the same rebuke. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a life it has been! And
now,--now it's over.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said this it seemed that for the moment
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) strength failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) fell backwards on the corner of the
sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) tried to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) shook him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) away, burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was standing close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
arm, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) heard a knock at the front door, which was immediately
opened, as the servants were hanging about in the hall. <div class="bookquote">``Who are
they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, whose sharp ears caught the sound of various
steps. Lord Nidderdale went out on to the head of the stairs, and
immediately heard the voice of Dolly Longestaffe.

<p/>Dolly Longestaffe had on that morning put himself early into the care
of Mr. Squercum, and it had happened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) lawyer had met
his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) father with Mr. Bideawhile at the corner of the square. They were
all coming according to appointment to receive the money which Mr.
Melmotte had promised to pay them at this very hour. Of course they
had none of them as yet heard of the way in which the Financier had
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) last grand payment, and as they walked together to the door
had been intent only in reference to their own money. Squercum, who
had heard a good deal on the previous day, was very certain that the
money would not be forthcoming, whereas Bideawhile was sanguine of
success. <div class="bookquote">``Don't we wish we may get it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Dolly had said, and by saying
so had very much offended his (<font color='blue'><b>Bideawhile</b></font>) father, who had resented the want of
reverence implied in the use of that word <div class="bookquote">``we.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>They had all been
admitted together, and Dolly had at once loudly claimed an old
acquaintance with some of the articles around him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I knew I'd got a
coat just like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, <div class="bookquote">``and I never could make out what my
fellow had done with it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>This was the speech which Nidderdale had
heard, standing on the top of the stairs.

<p/>The two lawyers had at once seen, from the face of the man who had
opened the door and from the presence of three or four servants in
the hall, that things were not going on in their usual course. Before
Dolly had completed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) buffoonery the butler had whispered to Mr.
Bideawhile that Mr. Melmotte--<div class="bookquote">``was no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melmotte/Mr. Melmotte/Augustus Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bideawhile/Bideawhile</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bideawhile. Squercum put his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
trowsers pockets and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) mouth wide. <div class="bookquote">``Dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>muttered Mr.
Longestaffe senior. <div class="bookquote">``Dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``Who's dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>The butler</b></font>)</div>The butler
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) head. Then Squercum whispered a word into the butler's
ear, and the butler thereupon nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It's about what I
expected,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>said Squercum. Then the butler whispered the word to Mr.
Longestaffe, and whispered it also to Mr. Bideawhile, and they all
knew that the millionaire had swallowed poison during the night.

<p/>It was known to the servants that Mr. Longestaffe was the owner of
the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was therefore, as having authority there, shown
into the room where the body of Melmotte was lying on a sofa. The two
lawyers and Dolly of course followed, as did also Lord Nidderdale,
who had now joined them from the lobby above. There was a policeman
in the room who seemed to be simply watching the body, and who
rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) seat when the gentlemen entered. Two or three of the
servants followed them, so that there was almost a crowd round the
dead man's bier. There was no further tale to be told. That Melmotte
had been in the House on the previous night, and had there disgraced
himself by intoxication, they had known already. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been
found dead that morning had been already announced. They could only
stand round and gaze on the square, sullen, livid features of the
big-framed man, and each lament that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever heard the name of
Melmotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in the house here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly to Lord Nidderdale in a
whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sent for me. We live quite close, you know. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wanted somebody
to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) something. I must go up to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) again now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed. I only came down when I heard your voices. I fear it will
be rather bad for you;--won't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was regularly smashed, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>asked Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) talked to me about his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) affairs once, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was such a liar that not a word that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said was worth anything.
I believed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) then. How it will go, I can't say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That other thing is all over of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>suggested Dolly.

<p/>Nidderdale intimated by a gesture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) head that the other thing
was all over, and then returned to Marie. There was nothing further
that the four gentlemen could do, and they soon departed from the
house;--not, however, till Mr. Bideawhile had given certain short
injunctions to the butler concerning the property contained in Mr.
Longestaffe's town residence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They had come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``There
was some appointment. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had told them to be all here at this hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They didn't know, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>asked Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,--till the man told them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you go in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; we all went into the room.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>Marie shuddered, and again hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
face. <div class="bookquote">``I think the best thing I can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale, <div class="bookquote">``is to go
to Abchurch Lane, and find out from Smith who is the lawyer whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
chiefly trusted. I know Smith had to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) own affairs, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) has told me so at the Board; and if necessary I will find out
Croll. No doubt I can trace him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>). Then we had better employ the lawyer
to arrange everything for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where had we better go to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where would Madame Melmotte wish to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere, so that we could hide ourselves. Perhaps Frankfort would
be the best. But shouldn't we stay till something has been done
here? And couldn't we have lodgings, so as to get away from Mr.
Longestaffe's house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Nidderdale promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) himself would look
for lodgings, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had seen the lawyer. <div class="bookquote">``And now, my lord,
I suppose that I never shall see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why you should say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it will be best. Why should you? All this will be trouble
enough to you when people begin to say what we are. But I don't think
it has been my fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing has ever been your fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my lord. I shall always think of you as one of the kindest
people I ever knew. I thought it best to send to you for different
reasons, but I do not want you to come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Marie. I shall always remember you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And so they parted.

<p/>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) did go into the City, and succeeded in finding both
Mr. Smith and Herr Croll. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) reached Abchurch Lane, the news of
Melmotte's death had already been spread abroad; and more was known,
or said to be known, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) circumstances than Nidderdale had as yet
heard. The crushing blow to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>), so said Herr Croll, had been the
desertion of Cohenlupe,--that and the sudden fall in the value of the
South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway shares, consequent on the
rumours spread about the City respecting the Pickering property. It
was asserted in Abchurch Lane that had he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) not at that moment touched
the Pickering property, or entertained the Emperor, or stood for
Westminster, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) must, by the end of the autumn, have been able to do
any or all of those things without danger, simply as the result of
the money which would then have been realised by the railway. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)
had allowed himself to become hampered by the want of comparatively
small sums of ready money, and in seeking relief had rushed from one
danger to another, till at last the waters around him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had become
too deep even for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>), and had overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>). As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) immediate
death, Herr Croll expressed not the slightest astonishment. It was
just the thing, Herr Croll said, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had been sure that Melmotte
would do, should his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) difficulties ever become too great for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And
dere vas a leetle ting he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lay himself open by de oder day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>said
Croll, <div class="bookquote">``dat vas nasty,--very nasty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>Nidderdale shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) head, but
asked no questions. Croll had alluded to the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) own name, but
did not on this occasion make any further revelation. Then Croll made
a further statement to Lord Nidderdale, which I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) must have
done in pure good-nature. <div class="bookquote">``My lor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) said, whispering very gravely,
<div class="bookquote">``de money of de yong lady is all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) head
three times. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody can toch it, not if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) vas in debt millions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to hear it for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord Nidderdale as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) leave.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXVII.

<p/>DOWN AT CARBURY.


<p/>When Roger Carbury returned to Suffolk, after seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousins in
Welbeck Street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was by no means contented with himself. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
should be discontented generally with the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life
was a matter of course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was farther removed than
ever from the object on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) whole mind was set. Had Hetta
Carbury learned all the circumstances of Paul's engagement with
Mrs. Hurtle before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had confessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) love to Paul,--so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
heart might have been turned against the man before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
confession,--then, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) might at last have listened to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had loved the other man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) might have at last
done so, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) love would have been buried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) own bosom. But the
tale had been told after the fashion which was most antagonistic to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own interests. Hetta had never heard Mrs. Hurtle's name till she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
had given herself away, and had declared to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) friends that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
had given herself away to this man, who was so unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). The
more Roger thought of this, the more angry he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was with Paul Montague,
and the more convinced that that man had done him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an injury which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could never forgive.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grief extended even beyond that. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was never tired
of swearing to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not forgive Paul Montague, yet
there was present to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a feeling that an injury was being done to
the man, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in some sort responsible for that injury.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had declined to tell Hetta any part of the story about Mrs.
Hurtle,--actuated by a feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought not to betray the trust
put in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by a man who was at the time his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told
nothing. But no one knew so well as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did the fact that all the
attention latterly given by Paul to the American woman had by no
means been the effect of love, but had come from a feeling on Paul's
part that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not desert the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once loved, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kindness. If Hetta could know everything
exactly,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could look back and read the state of Paul's mind as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Roger, could read it,--then she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) would probably forgive the man,
or perhaps tell herself that there was nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to forgive.
Roger was anxious that Hetta's anger should burn hot,--because of
the injury done to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) thought that there were ample reasons
why Paul Montague should be punished,--why Paul should be utterly
expelled from among them, and allowed to go his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own course. But it
was not right that the man should be punished on false grounds. It
seemed to Roger now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was doing an injustice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) enemy by
refraining from telling all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knew.

<p/>As to the girl's misery in losing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
true as it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was willing to devote himself and all that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) happiness, I do not think that at the present moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was disturbed in that direction. It is hardly natural, perhaps,
that a man should love a woman with such devotion as to wish to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) happy by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to another man. Roger told himself that
Paul would be an unsafe husband, a fickle husband,--one who might
be carried hither and thither both in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) circumstances and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
feelings,--and that it would be better for Hetta that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) should not
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>); but at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was unhappy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) reflected that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) himself was a party to a certain amount of deceit.

<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had said not a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had referred Hetta to the man
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did indeed accurately know,
the state of Hetta's mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was wretched because she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) thought that
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lover was winning her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) herself was willingly
allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to win her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) love, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was dallying with another woman, and
making to that other woman promises the same as those he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) made to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
This was not true. Roger knew that it was not true. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) tried
to quiet his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) conscience by saying that they must fight it out among
themselves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt himself to be uneasy under that assurance.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) life at Carbury, at this time, was very desolate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had become
tired of the priest, who, in spite of various repulses, had never for
a moment relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) efforts to convert his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friend. Roger had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) must beg that religion might not be made the subject
of further conversation between them. In answer to this, Father
Barham had declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barham</b></font>) would never consent to remain as an
intimate associate with any man on those terms. Roger had persisted
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) stipulation, and the priest had then suggested that it was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) host's intention to banish him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) from Carbury Hall. Roger had made
no reply, and the priest had of course been banished. But even this
added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) misery. Father Barham was a gentleman, was a good man,
and in great penury. To ill-treat such a one, to expel such a one
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, seemed to Roger to be an abominable cruelty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was
unhappy with himself about the priest, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not bid the
man come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was already being said of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
neighbours, at Eardly, at Caversham, and at the Bishop's palace, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) either had become or was becoming a Roman Catholic, under the
priest's influence. Mrs. Yeld had even taken upon herself to write
to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) a most affectionate letter, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) said very little as
to any evidence that had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) as to Roger's defection, but
dilated at very great length on the abominations of a certain lady
who is supposed to indulge in gorgeous colours.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was troubled, too, about old Daniel Ruggles, the farmer at Sheep's
Acre, who had been so angry because his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) niece would not marry John
Crumb. Old Ruggles, when abandoned by Ruby and accused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
neighbours of personal cruelty to the girl, had taken freely to that
source of consolation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) found to be most easily within his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
reach. Since Ruby had gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had been drunk every day, and was
making himself generally a scandal and a nuisance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) landlord
had interfered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) usual kindness, and the old man had always
declared that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) niece and John Crumb were the cause of it all;
for now, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) maudlin misery, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attributed as much blame to the
lover as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did to the girl. John Crumb wasn't in earnest. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had been in earnest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have gone after her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) to London at once.
No;--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't invite Ruby to come back. If Ruby would come back,
repentant, full of sorrow,--and hadn't been and made a fool of
herself in the meantime,--then he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'d think of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) back. In the
meantime, with circumstances in their present condition, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) evidently
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could best face the difficulties of the world by an
unfaltering adhesion to gin, early in the day and all day long. This,
too, was a grievance to Roger Carbury.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not neglect his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) work, the chief of which at the present
moment was the care of the farm which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) kept in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was making hay at this time in certain meadows down by the river
side; and was standing by while the men were loading a cart, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
saw John Crumb approaching across the field. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not seen John
since the eventful journey to London; nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in London;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew well all that had occurred,--how the dealer in pollard
had thrashed his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) cousin, Sir Felix, how he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) had been locked up by the
police and then liberated,--and how he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) was now regarded in Bungay
as a hero, as far as arms were concerned, but as being very <div class="bookquote">``soft''
 (<font color='red'><b>a hero</b></font>)</div>in the matter of love. The reader need hardly be told that Roger was
not at all disposed to quarrel with Mr. Crumb, because the victim
of Crumb's heroism had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) own cousin. Crumb had acted well,
and had never said a word about Sir Felix since his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) return to the
country. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) had now come to talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) love,--and in
order that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) confessions might not be made before all the assembled
haymakers, Roger Carbury hurried to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). There was soon
evident on Crumb's broad face a whole sunshine of delight. As Roger
approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) began to laugh aloud, and to wave a bit of paper
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a coomin; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a coomin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were the
first words he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) uttered. Roger knew very well that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friend's
mind there was but one <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>in the world, and that the name of that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was Ruby Ruggles.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a coomin; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a coomin.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has made it up with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
grandfather?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know now't about grandfeyther. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have made it up wi' me.
Know'd she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would when I'd polish'd t`other un off a bit;--know'd she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) written to you, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, squoire,--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ain't; not just herself. I do suppose that isn't
the way they does it. But it's all as one.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crumb</b></font>)</div>And then Mr. Crumb thrust
Mrs. Hurtle's note into Roger Carbury's hand.

<p/>Roger certainly was not predisposed to think well or kindly of Mrs.
Hurtle. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had first known Mrs. Hurtle's name, when Paul
Montague had told the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) engagement on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) return from
America, Roger had regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) as a wicked, intriguing, bad woman.
It may, perhaps, be confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was prejudiced against all
Americans, looking upon Washington much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did upon Jack Cade or
Wat Tyler; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) pictured to himself all American women as being
loud, masculine, and atheistical. But it certainly did seem that in
this instance Mrs. Hurtle was endeavouring to do a good turn from
pure charity. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>Crumb began to explain, <div class="bookquote">``who do be
living with Mrs. Pipkin; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) is a lady as is a lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger could not fully admit the truth of this assertion; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), too, knew something of Mrs. Hurtle, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
thought it probable that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said of Ruby might be true. <div class="bookquote">``True,
squoire!''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said Crumb, laughing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) whole face. <div class="bookquote">``I ha' nae a
doubt it's true. What's again its being true? When I had dropped into
t`other fellow, of course she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) choice. It was me as was to
blame, because I didn't do it before. I ought to ha' dropped into him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
when I first heard as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was arter her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). It's that as girls like. So,
squoire, I'm just going again to Lon`on right away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger suggested that old Ruggles would, of course, receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) niece;
but as to this John expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) supreme indifference. The old man
was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would like to have the old man's
money; but the old man couldn't live for ever, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) supposed that
things would come right in time. But this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't
going to cringe to the old man about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money. When Roger observed
that it would be better that Ruby should have some home to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
might at once return, John adverted with a renewed grin to all the
substantial comforts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own house. It seemed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) idea, that
on arriving in London he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would at once take Ruby away to church and
be married to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) out of hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had thrashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) rival, and what
cause could there now be for delay?

<p/>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) left the field he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) made one other speech to the squire.
<div class="bookquote">``You ain't a`taken it amiss, squoire, 'cause he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was coosin to
yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least, Mr. Crumb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's koind now. I ain't a done the yong man a ha`porth o' harm,
and I don't feel no grudge again him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and when me and Ruby's once
spliced, I'm darned if I don't give `un a bottle of wine the first
day as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll come to Bungay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Roger did not feel himself justified in accepting this invitation on
the part of Sir Felix; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
own part, thought that Crumb had behaved well in that matter of the
street encounter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) expressed a strong wish for the immediate
and continued happiness of Mr. and Mrs. John Crumb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ay, we'll be `appy, squoire,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said Crumb as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went exulting out
of the field.

<p/>On the day after this Roger Carbury received a letter which disturbed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) very much, and to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hardly knew whether to return any
answer, or what answer. It was from Paul Montague, and was written by
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) but a few hours after he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) letter for Hetta with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
own hands, at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) mother's house. Paul's letter to Roger
was as follows:--


<p/>MY DEAR ROGER,--

<p/>Though I know that you have cast me off from you I cannot
write to you in any other way, as any other way would be
untrue. You can answer me, of course, as you please, but
I do think that you will owe me an answer, as I appeal to
you in the name of justice.

<p/>You know what has taken place between Hetta and myself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) had accepted me, and therefore I am justified in
feeling sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) must have loved me. But she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) has now
quarrelled with me altogether, and has told me that I am
never to see her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) again. Of course I don't mean to put up
with this. Who would? You will say that it is no business
of yours. But I think that you would not wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>)
should be left under a false impression, if you could put
her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) right.

<p/>Somebody has told her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) the story of Mrs. Hurtle. I suppose
it was Felix, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had learned it from those people
at Islington. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) has been told that which is untrue.
Nobody knows and nobody can know the truth as you do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
supposes that I have willingly been passing my time with
Mrs. Hurtle during the last two months, although during
that very time I have asked for and have received the
assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) love. Now, whether or no I have been to
blame about Mrs. Hurtle,--as to which nothing at present
need be said,--it is certainly the truth that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) coming
to England was not only not desired by me, but was felt by
me to be the greatest possible misfortune. But after all
that had passed I certainly owed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) not to neglect
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>);--and this duty was the more incumbent on me as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
was a foreigner and unknown to any one. I went down to
Lowestoft with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) request, having named the place
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) as one known to myself, and because I could not
refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) so small a favour. You know that it was so, and
you know also, as no one else does, that whatever courtesy
I have shown to Mrs. Hurtle in England, I have been
constrained to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>).

<p/>I appeal to you to let Hetta know that this is true.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had made me understand that not only her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother and
brother, but you also, are well acquainted with the story
of my acquaintance with Mrs. Hurtle. Neither Lady Carbury
nor Sir Felix has ever known anything about it. You, and
you only, have known the truth. And now, though at the
present you are angry with me, I call upon you to tell
Hetta the truth as you know it. You will understand me
when I say that I feel that I am being destroyed by a
false representation. I think that you, who abhor a
falsehood, will see the justice of setting me right, at
any rate as far as the truth can do so. I do not want you
to say a word for me beyond that.

<p/>Yours always,

<p/>PAUL MONTAGUE.


<p/>What business is all that of mine? This, of course, was the first
feeling produced in Roger's mind by Montague's letter. If Hetta had
received any false impression, it had not come from him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had told
no stories against his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) rival, whether true or false. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had been so
scrupulous that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had refused to say a word at all. And if any false
impression had been made on Hetta's mind, either by circumstances
or by untrue words, had not Montague deserved any evil that might
fall upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)? Though every word in Montague's letter might be true,
nevertheless, in the end, no more than justice would be done him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),
even should he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) be robbed at last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mistress under erroneous
impressions. The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had once disgraced himself by offering
to make Mrs. Hurtle his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) wife, rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) unworthy of Hetta Carbury.
Such, at least, was Roger Carbury's verdict as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought over all
the circumstances. At any rate, it was no business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to correct
these wrong impressions.

<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was ill at ease as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought of it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did believe
that every word in Montague's letter was true. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been
very indignant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) met Paul and Mrs. Hurtle together on the sands
at Lowestoft, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was perfectly convinced that the cause of their
coming there had been precisely that which Montague had stated.
It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) two days to think over all this, two days of great
discomfort and unhappiness. After all, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) be a dog in the
manger? The girl did not care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),--looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) as an old man
to be regarded in a fashion altogether different from that in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) regarded Paul Montague. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had let his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) time for love-making go
by, and now it behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), as a man, to take the world as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found
it, and not to lose himself in regrets for a kind of happiness which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could never attain. In such an emergency as this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should do what
was fair and honest, without reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own feelings. And yet
the passion which dominated John Crumb altogether, which made the
mealman so intent on the attainment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) object as to render all
other things indifferent to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the time, was equally strong with
Roger Carbury. Unfortunately for Roger, strong as his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) passion was,
it was embarrassed by other feelings. It never occurred to Crumb to
think whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was a fit husband for Ruby, or whether Ruby, having
a decided preference for another man, could be a fit wife for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
But with Roger there were a thousand surrounding difficulties to
hamper him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). John Crumb never doubted for a moment what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should
do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had to get the girl, if possible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) meant to get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was always confident though sometimes
perplexed. But Roger had no confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should never
win the game. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) sadder moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) ought not to
win it. The people around him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), from old fashion, still called him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
the young squire! Why;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) felt himself at times to be eighty years
old,--so old that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was unfitted for intercourse with such juvenile
spirits as those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) neighbour the bishop, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) friend
Hepworth. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), by any training, bring himself to take her (<font color='blue'><b>neighbour</b></font>)
happiness in hand, altogether sacrificing his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own?

<p/>In such a mood as this he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did at last answer his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) enemy's letter,--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) answered it as follows:--


<p/>I do not know that I am concerned to meddle in your
affairs at all. I have told no tale against you, and I
do not know that I have any that I wish to tell in your
favour, or that I could so tell if I did wish. I think
that you have behaved badly to me, cruelly to Mrs. Hurtle,
and disrespectfully to my cousin. Nevertheless, as you
appeal to me on a certain point for evidence which I
can give, and which you say no one else can give, I do
acknowledge that, in my opinion, Mrs. Hurtle's presence in
England has not been in accordance with your wishes, and
that you accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to Lowestoft, not as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) lover
but as an old friend whom you could not neglect.

<p/>ROGER CARBURY.

<p/>Paul Montague, Esq..

<p/>You are at liberty to show this letter to Miss Carbury,
if you please; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) reads part she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) should read the
whole!


<p/>There was more perhaps of hostility in this letter than of that
spirit of self-sacrifice to which Roger intended to train himself;
and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) himself felt after the letter had been dispatched.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXVIII.

<p/>THE INQUEST.


<p/>Melmotte had been found dead on Friday morning, and late on the
evening of the same day Madame Melmotte and Marie were removed to
lodgings far away from the scene of the tragedy, up at Hampstead.
Herr Croll had known of the place, and at Lord Nidderdale's instance
had busied himself in the matter, and had seen that the rooms were
made instantly ready for the widow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) late employer. Nidderdale
himself had assisted them in their departure; and the German, with
the poor woman's maid, with the jewels also, which had been packed
according to Melmotte's last orders to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) wife, followed the
carriage which took the mother and the daughter. They did not start
till nine o'clock in the evening, and Madame Melmotte at the moment
would fain have been allowed to rest one other night in Bruton
Street. But Lord Nidderdale, with one hardly uttered word, made Marie
understand that the inquest would be held early on the following
morning, and Marie was imperious with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mother and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
point. So the poor woman was taken away from Mr. Longestaffe's
residence, and never again saw the grandeur of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own house in
Grosvenor Square, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not visited since the night on which
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had helped to entertain the Emperor of China.

<p/>On Saturday morning the inquest was held. There was not the slightest
doubt as to any one of the incidents of the catastrophe. The
servants, the doctor, and the inspector of police between them,
learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) had come home alone, that nobody had been near him (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>)
during the night, that he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) had been found dead, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) had
undoubtedly been poisoned by prussic acid. It was also proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>)
had been drunk in the House of Commons, a fact to which one of the
clerks of the House, very much against his (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) will, was called upon to
testify. That he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) had destroyed himself there was no doubt,--nor was
there any doubt as to the cause.

<p/>In such cases as this it is for the jury to say whether the
unfortunate one who has found his (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) life too hard for endurance,
and has rushed away to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) could not find an improved
condition of things elsewhere, has or has not been mad at the moment.
Surviving friends are of course anxious for a verdict of insanity, as
in that case no further punishment is exacted. The body can be buried
like any other body, and it can always be said afterwards that the
poor man was mad. Perhaps it would be well that all suicides should
be said to have been mad, for certainly the jurymen are not generally
guided in their verdicts by any accurately ascertained facts. If the
poor wretch has, up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last days, been apparently living a decent
life; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be not hated, or has not in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last moments made himself
specially obnoxious to the world at large, then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is declared to
have been mad. Who would be heavy on a poor clergyman who has been
at last driven by horrid doubts to rid himself of a difficulty from
which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) saw no escape in any other way? Who would not give the
benefit of the doubt to the poor woman whose lover and lord had
deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? Who would remit to unhallowed earth the body of the
once beneficent philosopher who has simply thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) might
as well go now, finding himself powerless to do further good upon
earth? Such, and such like, have of course been temporarily insane,
though no touch even of strangeness may have marked their conduct
up to their last known dealings with their fellow-mortals. But let
a Melmotte be found dead, with a bottle of prussic acid by his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>)
side--a man who has become horrid to the world because of his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) late
iniquities, a man who has so well pretended to be rich that he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) has
been able to buy and to sell properties without paying for them, a
wretch who has made himself odious by his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) ruin to friends who had
taken him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) up as a pillar of strength in regard to wealth, a brute
who had got into the House of Commons by false pretences, and had
disgraced the House by being drunk there,--and, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) will
not be saved by a verdict of insanity from the cross roads, or
whatever scornful grave may be allowed to those who have killed
themselves, with their wits about them. Just at this moment there was
a very strong feeling against Melmotte, owing perhaps as much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
having tumbled over poor Mr. Beauclerk in the House of Commons as
to the stories of the forgeries he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had committed, and the virtue of
the day vindicated itself by declaring him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to have been responsible
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) actions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took the poison. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was _felo de se_, and
therefore carried away to the cross roads--or elsewhere. But it may
be imagined, I think, that during that night he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) may have become as
mad as any other wretch, have been driven as far beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) powers
of endurance as any other poor creature who ever at any time felt
himself constrained to go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had not been so drunk but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) knew
all that happened, and could foresee pretty well what would happen.
The summons to attend upon the Lord Mayor had been served upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>).
There were some, among them Croll and Mr. Brehgert, who absolutely
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had committed forgery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) had no money for the
Longestaffes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was well aware what Squercum would do at once.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had assured himself long ago,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) had assured himself indeed not
very long ago,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) would brave it all like a man. But we none
of us know what load we can bear, and what would break our backs.
Melmotte's back had been so utterly crushed that I almost think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was mad enough to have justified a verdict of temporary insanity.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was carried away, no one knew whither, and for a week his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
name was hateful. But after that, a certain amount of whitewashing
took place, and, in some degree, a restitution of fame was made
to the manes of the departed. In Westminster he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was always odious.
Westminster, which had adopted him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>), never forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). But in other
districts it came to be said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had been more sinned
against than sinning; and that, but for the jealousy of the old
stagers in the mercantile world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would have done very wonderful
things. Marylebone, which is always merciful, took him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) up quite with
affection, and would have returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) ghost to Parliament could his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
ghost have paid for committee rooms. Finsbury delighted for a while
to talk of the great Financier, and even Chelsea thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had
been done to death by ungenerous tongues. It was, however, Marylebone
alone that spoke of a monument.

<p/>Mr. Longestaffe came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) house, taking formal possession of
it a few days after the verdict. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was alone. There had
been no further question of bringing the ladies of the family up to
town; and Dolly altogether declined to share with his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) father the
honour of encountering the dead man's spirit. But there was very much
for Mr. Longestaffe to do, and very much also for his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son. It was
becoming a question with both of them how far they had been ruined by
their connection with the horrible man. It was clear that they could
not get back the title-deeds of the Pickering property without paying
the amount which had been advanced upon them, and it was equally
clear that they could not pay that sum unless they were enabled to
do so by funds coming out of the Melmotte estate. Dolly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) sat
smoking upon the stool in Mr. Squercum's office, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) now passed
a considerable portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) time, looked upon himself as a miracle
of ill-usage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George, you know, I shall have to go to law with the governor.
There's nothing else for it; is there, Squercum?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div><p/>Squercum suggested that they had better wait till they found what
pickings there might be out of the Melmotte estate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had made
inquiries too about that, and had been assured that there must
be property, but property so involved and tied up as to make it
impossible to lay hands upon it suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``They say that the things
in the square, and the plate, and the carriages and horses, and all
that, ought to fetch between twenty and thirty thousand. There were
a lot of jewels, but the women have taken them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>said Squercum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George, they ought to be made to give up everything. Did you ever
hear of such a thing;--the very house pulled down;--my house; and all
done without a word from me in the matter? I don't suppose such a
thing was ever known before, since properties were properties.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) uttered sundry threats against the Bideawhiles, in reference to
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) intention of <div class="bookquote">``making it very hot for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was an annoyance added to the elder Mr. Longestaffe that the
management of Melmotte's affairs fell at last almost exclusively
into the hands of Mr. Brehgert. Now Brehgert, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) many
dealings with Melmotte, was an honest man, and, which was perhaps
of as much immediate consequence, both an energetic and a patient
man. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the man who had wanted to marry Georgiana
Longestaffe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the man to whom Mr. Longestaffe had been
particularly uncivil. Then there arose necessities for the presence
of Mr. Brehgert in the house in which Melmotte had lately lived and
had died. The dead man's papers were still there,--deeds, documents,
and such letters as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not chosen to destroy;--and these could
not be removed quite at once. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brehgert must of course have
access to my private room, as long as it is necessary,--absolutely
necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe in answer to a message which
was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) will of course see the expediency of
relieving me from such intrusion as soon as possible.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) soon
found it preferable to come to terms with the rejected suitor,
especially as the man was singularly good-natured and forbearing
after the injuries he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had received.

<p/>All minor debts were to be paid at once; an arrangement to which Mr.
Longestaffe cordially agreed, as it included a sum of #300 due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
for the rent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) house in Bruton Street. Then by degrees it became
known that there would certainly be a dividend of not less than fifty
per cent. payable on debts which could be proved to have been owing
by Melmotte, and perhaps of more;--an arrangement which was very
comfortable to Dolly, as it had been already agreed between all the
parties interested that the debt due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should be satisfied
before the father took anything. Mr. Longestaffe resolved during
these weeks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) remained in town that, as regarded himself and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) own family, the house in London should not only not be kept
up, but that it should be absolutely sold, with all its belongings,
and that the servants at Caversham should be reduced in number,
and should cease to wear powder. All this was communicated to Lady
Pomona in a very long letter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) was instructed to read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
daughters. <div class="bookquote">``I have suffered great wrongs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe, <div class="bookquote">``but
I must submit to them, and as I submit so must my wife and children.
If our son were different from what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is the sacrifice might
probably be made lighter. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) nature I cannot alter, but from my
daughters I expect cheerful obedience.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>From what incidents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
past life he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) was led to expect cheerfulness at Caversham it might be
difficult to say; but the obedience was there. Georgey was for the
time broken down; Sophia was satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) nuptial prospects,
and Lady Pomona had certainly no spirits left for a combat. I think
the loss of the hair-powder afflicted her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) most; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) said not a
word even about that.

<p/>But in all this the details necessary for the telling of our story
are anticipated. Mr. Longestaffe had remained in London actually over
the 1st of September, which in Suffolk is the one great festival of
the year, before the letter was written to which allusion has been
made. In the meantime he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) saw much of Mr. Brehgert, and absolutely
formed a kind of friendship for that gentleman, in spite of the
abomination of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) religion,--so that on one occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) even
condescended to ask Mr. Brehgert to dine alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) in Bruton
Street. This, too, was in the early days of the arrangement of the
Melmotte affairs, when Mr. Longestaffe's heart had been softened
by that arrangement with reference to the rent. Mr. Brehgert came,
and there arose a somewhat singular conversation between the two
gentlemen as they sat together over a bottle of Mr. Longestaffe's old
port wine. Hitherto not a word had passed between them respecting the
connection which had once been proposed, since the day on which the
young lady's father had said so many bitter things to the expectant
bridegroom. But in this evening Mr. Brehgert, who was by no means a
coward in such matters and whose feelings were not perhaps painfully
fine, spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) mind in a way that at first startled Mr. Longestaffe.
The subject was introduced by a reference which Brehgert had made to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) own affairs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) loss would be, at any rate, double that which
Mr. Longestaffe would have to bear;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) spoke of it in an easy
way, as though it did not sit very near his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``Of course there's
a difference between me and you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) said. Mr. Longestaffe bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
head graciously, as much as to say that there was of course a very
wide difference. <div class="bookquote">``In our affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div>continued Brehgert, <div class="bookquote">``we expect
gains, and of course look for occasional losses. When a gentleman in
your position sells a property he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) expects to get the purchase-money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) does, Mr. Brehgert. That's what made it so hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't even yet quite understand how it was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>), or why he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)
took upon himself to spend such an enormous deal of money here in
London. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) business was quite irregular, but there was very much of
it, and some of it immensely profitable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) took us in completely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was old Mr. Todd that first took to him (<font color='blue'><b>Todd</b></font>);--but I was deceived as
much as Todd, and then I ventured on a speculation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Todd</b></font>) outside
of our house. The long and the short of it is that I shall lose
something about sixty thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a large sum of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very large;--so large as to affect my daily mode of life. In my
correspondence with your daughter, I considered it to be my duty to
point out to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that it would be so. I do not know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) told
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>This reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) daughter for the moment altogether upset Mr.
Longestaffe. The reference was certainly most indelicate, most
deserving of censure; but Mr. Longestaffe did not know how to
pronounce his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) censure on the spur of the moment, and was moreover at
the present time so very anxious for Brehgert's assistance in the
arrangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) affairs that, so to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) could not afford to
quarrel with the man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) assumed something more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) normal
dignity as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) asserted that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) daughter had never mentioned the
fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div>said Brehgert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt;'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>--and Mr. Longestaffe assumed a great deal of dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it was so. I had promised your daughter when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was good
enough to listen to the proposition which I made to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), that I would
maintain a second house when we should be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Longestaffe,--meaning to assert that
such hymeneals were altogether unnatural and out of the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been quite possible as things were when that
proposition was made. But looking forward to the loss which
I afterwards anticipated from the affairs of our deceased friend,
I found it to be prudent to relinquish my intention for the present,
and I thought myself bound to inform Miss Longestaffe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There were other reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>muttered Mr. Longestaffe, in a suppressed
voice, almost in a whisper,--in a whisper which was intended to
convey a sense of present horror and a desire for future reticence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There may have been; but in the last letter which Miss Longestaffe
did me the honour to write to me,--a letter with which I have not
the slightest right to find any fault,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) seemed to me to confine
herself almost exclusively to that reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why mention this now, Mr. Brehgert; why mention this now? The
subject is painful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just because it is not painful to me, Mr. Longestaffe; and because
I wish that all they who have heard of the matter should know that it
is not painful. I think that throughout I behaved like a gentleman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Mr. Longestaffe, in an agony, first shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) head twice, and then
bowed it three times, leaving the Jew to take what answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could
from so dubious an oracle. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div>continued Brehgert, <div class="bookquote">``that I
behaved like an honest man; and I didn't quite like that the matter
should be passed over as if I was in any way ashamed of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps on so delicate a subject the less said the soonest mended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've nothing more to say, and I've nothing at all to mend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brehgert/Brehgert/MR. BREHGERT</b></font>)</div>Finishing the conversation with this little speech Brehgert arose to
take his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) leave, making some promise at the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) would use
all the expedition in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) power to complete the arrangement of the
Melmotte affairs.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) was gone Mr. Longestaffe opened the door and walked
about the room and blew out long puffs of breath, as though to
cleanse himself from the impurities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) late contact. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) told
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) could not touch pitch and not be defiled! How vulgar
had the man been, how indelicate, how regardless of all feeling, how
little grateful for the honour which Mr. Longestaffe had conferred
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) by asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) to dinner! Yes;--yes! A horrid Jew! Were not
all Jews necessarily an abomination? Yet Mr. Longestaffe was aware
that in the present crisis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) fortunes he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) could not afford to
quarrel with Mr. Brehgert.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a long time now since Lady Carbury's great historical work
on the Criminal Queens of the World had been completed and given to
the world. Any reader careful as to dates will remember that it was
as far back as in February that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had solicited the assistance of
certain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) literary friends who were connected with the daily and
weekly press. These gentlemen had responded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) call with more or
less zealous aid, so that the <div class="bookquote">``Criminal Queens''  (<font color='red'><b>These gentlemen</b></font>)</div>had been regarded
in the trade as one of the successful books of the season. Messrs.
Leadham and Loiter had published a second, and then, very quickly, a
fourth and fifth edition; and had been able in their advertisements
to give testimony from various criticisms showing that Lady Carbury's
book was about the greatest historical work which had emanated from
the press in the present century. With this object a passage was
extracted even from the columns of the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit,'' (<font color='red'><b>some man</b></font>)</div>--which
showed very great ingenuity on the part of some young man connected
with the establishment of Messrs. Leadham and Loiter. Lady Carbury
had suffered something in the struggle. What efforts can mortals make
as to which there will not be some disappointment? Paper and print
cannot be had for nothing, and advertisements are very costly. An
edition may be sold with startling rapidity, but it may have been but
a scanty edition. When Lady Carbury received from Messrs. Leadham and
Loiter their second very moderate cheque, with the expression of a
fear on their part that there would not probably be a third,--unless
some unforeseen demand should arise,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) repeated to herself those
well-known lines from the satirist,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Amos Cottle, for a moment think
What meagre profits spread from pen and ink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the satirist</b></font>)</div><p/>But not on that account did she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) for a moment hesitate as to further
attempts. Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had hardly completed the last chapter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``Criminal Queens''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>before she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was busy on another work; and although
the last six months had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) a period of incessant trouble,
and sometimes of torture, though the conduct of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son had more than
once forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to declare to herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind would fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),
still she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had persevered. From day to day, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cares heavy
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) work, with a firm resolve that so many
lines should be always forthcoming, let the difficulty of making them
be what it might. Messrs. Leadham and Loiter had thought that they
might be justified in offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) certain terms for a novel,--terms
not very high indeed, and those contingent on the approval of the
manuscript by their reader. The smallness of the sum offered, and
the want of certainty, and the pain of the work in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) present
circumstances, had all been felt by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to be very hard. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
persevered, and the novel was now complete.

<p/>It cannot with truth be said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had had any special tale
to tell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had taken to the writing of a novel because Mr. Loiter
had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that upon the whole novels did better than anything
else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would have written a volume of sermons on the same
encouragement, and have gone about the work exactly after the same
fashion. The length of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) novel had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) first question. It must
be in three volumes, and each volume must have three hundred pages.
But what fewest number of words might be supposed sufficient to fill
a page? The money offered was too trifling to allow of very liberal
measure on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) part. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had to live, and if possible to write
another novel,--and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hoped, upon better terms,--when this
should be finished. Then what should be the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) novel; what
the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hero; and above all what the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heroine? It
must be a love story of course; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would leave
the complications of the plot to come by chance,--and they did come.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't let it end unhappily, Lady Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Loiter</b></font>)</div>Mr. Loiter had said,
<div class="bookquote">``because though people like it in a play, they hate it in a book. And
whatever you do, Lady Carbury, don't be historical. Your historical
novel, Lady Carbury, isn't worth a--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Loiter</b></font>)</div>Mr. Loiter stopping himself
suddenly, and remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Loiter</b></font>) was addressing himself to a lady,
satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Loiter</b></font>) energy at last by the use of the word <div class="bookquote">``straw.''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>Lady
Carbury had followed these instructions with accuracy.

<p/>The name for the story had been the great thing. It did not occur to
the authoress that, as the plot was to be allowed to develop itself
and was, at this moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was perplexed as to the title,
altogether uncreated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might as well wait to see what appellation
might best suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) work when its purpose should have declared
itself. A novel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew well, was most unlike a rose, which by
any other name will smell as sweet. <div class="bookquote">``The Faultless Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The
Mysterious Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Lame Lover,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--such names as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was
aware would be useless now. <div class="bookquote">``Mary Jane Walker,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could be very
simple, would do, or <div class="bookquote">``Blanche De Veau,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) were able to maintain
throughout a somewhat high-stilted style of feminine rapture. But
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) considered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could best deal with rapid action and
strange coincidences, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought that something more startling and
descriptive would better suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) purpose. After an hour's thought a
name did occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wrote it down, and with considerable
energy of purpose framed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) work in accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) chosen
title, <div class="bookquote">``The Wheel of Fortune!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had no particular fortune in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) chose it, and no particular wheel;--but the very idea
conveyed by the words gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) the plot which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wanted. A young
lady was blessed with great wealth, and lost it all by an uncle,
and got it all back by an honest lawyer, and gave it all up to a
distressed lover, and found it all again in the third volume. And the
lady's name was Cordinga, selected by Lady Carbury as never having
been heard before either in the world of fact or in that of fiction.

<p/>And now with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) troubles thick about her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),--while her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son was
still hanging about the house in a condition that would break any
mother's heart, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter was so wretched and sore that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
regarded all those around her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) enemies, Lady Carbury finished
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) work, and having just written the last words in which the final
glow of enduring happiness was given to the young married heroine
whose wheel had now come full round, sat with the sheets piled at her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
right hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) had allowed herself a certain number of weeks for
the task, and had completed it exactly in the time fixed. As she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) sat
with her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) hand near the pile, she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) did give herself credit for her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
diligence. Whether the work might have been better done she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) never
asked herself. I do not think that she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) prided herself much on the
literary merit of the tale. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) could bring the papers to
praise it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) could induce Mudie to circulate it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) could
manage that the air for a month should be so loaded with <div class="bookquote">``The Wheel
of Fortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as to make it necessary for the reading world to have
read or to have said that it had read the book,--then she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) would pride
herself very much upon her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) work.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was so sitting on a Sunday afternoon, in her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) own room, Mr. Alf
was announced. According to her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) habit, she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) expressed warm delight at
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>). Nothing could be kinder than such a visit just at such a
time,--when there was so very much to occupy such a one as Mr. Alf!
Mr. Alf, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) usual mildly satirical way, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) was not
peculiarly occupied just at present. <div class="bookquote">``The Emperor has left Europe
at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Melmotte poisoned himself on Friday, and
the inquest sat yesterday. I don't know that there is anything of
interest to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Of course Lady Carbury was intent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) book,
rather even than on the exciting death of a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had herself
known. Oh, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could only get Mr. Alf! She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had tried it before,
and had failed lamentably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was well aware of that; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
a deep-seated conviction that it would be almost impossible to get
Mr. Alf. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had another deep-seated conviction, that that
which is almost impossible may possibly be done. How great would be
the glory, how infinite the service! And did it not seem as though
Providence had blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) with this special opportunity, sending Mr.
Alf to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) just at the one moment at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might introduce the
subject of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) novel without seeming premeditation?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, affecting to throw herself back as though
stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) arms out for ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I am not adding to your fatigue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Alf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no. It is not the fatigue of the moment, but of the last six
months. Just as you knocked at the door, I had finished the novel at
which I have been working, oh, with such diligence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,--a novel! When is it to appear, Lady Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must ask Leadham and Loiter that question. I have done my part
of the work. I suppose you never wrote a novel, Mr. Alf?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? Oh dear no; I never write anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have sometimes wondered whether I have hated or loved it the most.
One becomes so absorbed in one's plot and one's characters! One loves
the loveable so intensely, and hates with such fixed aversion those
who are intended to be hated. When the mind is attuned to it, one
is tempted to think that it is all so good. One cries at one's own
pathos, laughs at one's own humour, and is lost in admiration at
one's own sagacity and knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very nice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then there comes the reversed picture, the other side of the
coin. On a sudden everything becomes flat, tedious, and unnatural.
The heroine who was yesterday alive with the celestial spark is found
to-day to be a lump of motionless clay. The dialogue that was so
cheery on the first perusal is utterly uninteresting at a second
reading. Yesterday I was sure that there was my monument,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand upon the manuscript; <div class="bookquote">``to-day I feel it to be only too
heavy for a gravestone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One's judgment about one's-self always does vacillate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Alf
in a tone as phlegmatic as were the words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet it is so important that one should be able to judge
correctly of one's own work! I can at any rate trust myself to be
honest, which is more perhaps than can be said of all the critics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Dishonesty is not the general fault of the critics, Lady
Carbury,--at least not as far as I have observed the business. It is
incapacity. In what little I have done in the matter, that is the
sin which I have striven to conquer. When we want shoes we go to a
professed shoemaker; but for criticism we have certainly not gone to
professed critics. I think that when I gave up the ``Evening Pulpit,<div class="bookquote">''
I left upon it a staff of writers who are entitled to be regarded as
knowing their business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You given up the ``Pulpit'? asked Lady Carbury with astonishment,
readjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind at once, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) might perceive whether any
and if so what advantage might be taken of Mr. Alf's new position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
was no longer editor, and therefore his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) heavy sense of responsibility
would no longer exist;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) must still have influence. Might he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
not be persuaded to do one act of real friendship? Might she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) not
succeed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would come down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) high seat, sink on the ground
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>), tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) the plain truth, and beg for a favour as a poor
struggling woman?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Lady Carbury, I have given it up. It was a matter of course
that I should do so when I stood for Parliament. Now that the new
member has so suddenly vacated his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) seat, I shall probably stand
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are no longer an editor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have given it up, and I suppose I have now satisfied the scruples
of those gentlemen who seemed to think that I was committing a crime
against the Constitution in attempting to get into Parliament while
I was managing a newspaper. I never heard such nonsense. Of course
I know where it came from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did it come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Where should it come from but the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table'? Broune and I

know he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) is the most jealous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is so little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was really very fond of
Mr. Broune, but at the present moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was obliged to humour Mr.
Alf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that no man can be better qualified to sit in
Parliament than an editor of a newspaper,--that is if he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) is capable
as an editor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one, I think, has ever doubted that of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The only question is whether he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) be strong enough for the double
work. I have doubted about myself, and have therefore given up the
paper. I almost regret it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, feeling intensely anxious
to talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own affairs instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you still
retain an interest in the paper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some pecuniary interest;--nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Alf,--you could do me such a favour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I? If I can, you may be sure I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>False-hearted,
false-tongued man! Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) knew at the moment what was the
favour Lady Carbury intended to ask, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) would not do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) was asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>And Lady Carbury clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hands together as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) poured
forth the words of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) prayer. <div class="bookquote">``I never asked you to do anything for
me as long as you were editing the paper. Did I? I did not think it
right, and I would not do it. I took my chance like others, and I am
sure you must own that I bore what was said of me with a good grace.
I never complained. Did I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But now that you have left it yourself,--if you would have the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``The <div class="bookquote">``Wheel of Fortune'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the name of my novel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand
softly upon the manuscript. <div class="bookquote">``Just at this moment it would be the
making of a fortune for me! And, oh, Mr. Alf, if you could but know
how I want such assistance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing further to do with the editorial management, Lady
Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you could get it done. A word from you would make it
certain. A novel is different from an historical work, you know.
I have taken so much pains with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then no doubt it will be praised on its own merits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Don't say that, Mr. Alf. The ``Evening Pulpit' is like,--oh, it is
like,--like,--like the throne of heaven! Who can be justified before
it? Don't talk about its own merits, but say that you will have it
done. It couldn't do any man any harm, and it would sell five hundred
copies at once,--that is if it were done really con amore.'' Mr. Alf
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) almost piteously, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``The paper stands
so high, it can't hurt it to do that kind of thing once. A woman is
asking you, Mr. Alf. It is for my children that I am struggling. The
thing is done every day of the week, with much less noble motives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I do not think that it has ever been done by the <div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen books praised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I saw a novel spoken highly of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Alf laughed. ``Why not? You do not suppose that it is the object
of the <div class="bookquote">``Pulpit' to cry down novels?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was; but I thought you might make an exception here.
I would be so thankful;--so grateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Carbury, pray believe me when I say that I have nothing
to do with it. I need not preach to you sermons about literary
virtue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, not quite understanding what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The sceptre has passed from my hands, and I need not vindicate the
justice of my successor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never know your successor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must assure you that on no account should I think of meddling
with the literary arrangement of the paper. I would not do it for
my sister.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury looked greatly pained. <div class="bookquote">``Send the book out,
and let it take its chance. How much prouder you will be to have it
praised because it deserves praise, than to know that it has been
eulogised as a mark of friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that anything
like real selling praise is ever given to anybody, except to friends.
I don't know how they manage it, but they do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>Mr. Alf shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>)
head. ``Oh yes; that is all very well from you. Of course you have
been a dragon of virtue; but they tell me that the authoress of the
<div class="bookquote">``New Cleopatra' is a very handsome woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury must have
been worried much beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wont, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) allowed herself so far
to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) temper as to bring against Mr. Alf the double charge of
being too fond of the authoress in question, and of having sacrificed
the justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) columns to that improper affection.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: <div class="bookquote">``Of course you have been a dragon of virtue.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/><div class="bookquote">``At this moment I do not remember the name of the lady to whom you
allude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Alf, getting up to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) leave; <div class="bookquote">``and I am quite
sure that the gentleman who reviewed the book,--if there be any
such lady and any such book,--had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alf/Alf/Mr. Ferdinand Alf</b></font>)</div>And so Mr. Alf
departed.

<p/>Lady Carbury was very angry with herself, and very angry also with
Mr. Alf. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not only meant to be piteous, but had made the
attempt and then had allowed herself to be carried away into anger.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had degraded herself to humility, and had then wasted any
possible good result by a foolish fit of chagrin. The world in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had to live was almost too hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). When left alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sat
weeping over her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sorrows; but when from time to time she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought of
Mr. Alf and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) conduct, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could hardly repress her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) scorn. What
lies he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)! Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) could have done it had he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) chosen.
But the assumed honesty of the man was infinitely worse to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) lies. No doubt the <div class="bookquote">``Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had two objects in its criticisms.
Other papers probably had but one. The object common to all papers,
that of helping friends and destroying enemies, of course prevailed
with the <div class="bookquote">``Pulpit.''  (<font color='red'><b>enemies</b></font>)</div>There was the second purpose of enticing readers
by crushing authors,--as crowds used to be enticed to see men hanged
when executions were done in public. But neither the one object nor
the other was compatible with that Aristidean justice which Mr. Alf
arrogated to himself and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hoped with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heart
that Mr. Alf would spend a great deal of money at Westminster, and
then lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) seat.

<p/>On the following morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) herself took the manuscript to Messrs.
Leadham and Loiter, and was hurt again by the small amount of respect
which seemed to be paid to the collected sheets. There was the work
of six months; her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) very blood and brains,--the concentrated essence
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind,--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would say herself when talking with energy of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own performances; and Mr. Leadham pitched it across to a clerk,
apparently perhaps sixteen years of age, and the lad chucked the
parcel unceremoniously under a counter. An author feels that his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) work
should be taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) with fast-clutching but reverential hands,
and held thoughtfully, out of harm's way, till it be deposited within
the very sanctum of an absolutely fireproof safe. Oh, heavens, if it
should be lost!--or burned!--or stolen! Those scraps of paper, so
easily destroyed, apparently so little respected, may hereafter be
acknowledged to have had a value greater, so far greater, than their
weight in gold! If <div class="bookquote">``Robinson Crusoe''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had been lost! If <div class="bookquote">``Tom Jones''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had been consumed by flames! And who knows but that this may be
another <div class="bookquote">``Robinson Crusoe,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--a better than <div class="bookquote">``Tom Jones'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>? <div class="bookquote">``Will it be
safe there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite safe,--quite safe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leadham/Leadham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Leadham, who was rather busy,
and who perhaps saw Lady Carbury more frequently than the nature and
amount of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) authorship seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) to require.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seemed to be,--put down there,--under the counter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's quite right, Lady Carbury. They're left there till they're
packed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Packed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two or three dozen going to our reader this week. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)'s
down in Skye, and we keep them till there's enough to fill the sack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they go by post, Mr. Leadham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not by post, Lady Carbury. There are not many of them would pay the
expense. We send them by long sea to Glasgow, because just at this
time of the year there is not much hurry. We can't publish before the
winter.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh, heavens! If that ship should be lost on its journey by
long sea to Glasgow!

<p/>That evening, as was now almost his (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) daily habit, Mr. Broune came to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). There was something in the absolute friendship which now existed
between Lady Carbury and the editor of the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>which almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) scrupulous as to asking from him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) any further
literary favour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) fully recognised,--no woman perhaps more
fully,--the necessity of making use of all aid and furtherance
which might come within reach. With such a son, with such need for
struggling before her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), would she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) not be wicked not to catch even
at every straw? But this man had now become so true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hardly knew how to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
mistaken feelings, did in truth know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought not to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for which,--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
felt infinitely grateful. And though she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) money, and had supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) misery by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued
counsel. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would offer to do this thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would accept
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kindness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knees,--but even she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not bring herself to
ask to have this added to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other favours. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) first word to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was about Mr. Alf. <div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) has given up the paper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes;--nominally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>)'ll really let it go out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) own hands. Nobody
likes to lose power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>)'ll share the work, and keep the authority. As
for Westminster, I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Leadham</b></font>) has a chance. If that poor wretch
Melmotte could beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) when everybody was already talking about
the forgeries, how is it likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) should stand against such a
candidate as they'll get now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was here yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And full of triumph, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) never talks to me much of himself. We were speaking of my new
book,--my novel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) assured me most positively that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had nothing
further to do with the paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did not care to make you a promise, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was just it. Of course I did not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither will I make a promise, but we'll see what we can do. If we
can't be good-natured, at any rate we will say nothing ill-natured.
Let me see,--what is the name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`The Wheel of Fortune.'''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) told the title of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
new book to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) old friend seemed to be almost ashamed of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let them send it early,--a day or two before it's out, if they can.
I can't answer, of course, for the opinion of the gentleman it will
go to, but nothing shall go in that you would dislike. Good-bye.

though the old susceptibility were returning to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sat alone after he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had gone, thinking over it all,--thinking
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own circumstances and of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kindness,--it did not occur
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to call him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) an old goose again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) felt now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
mistaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) man when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had so regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). That first and
only kiss which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had treated with so
much derision, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so mildly and yet so
haughtily, had now a somewhat sacred spot in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) memory. Through it
all the man must have really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)! Was it not marvellous that
such a thing should be? And how had it come to pass that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) tenderness had rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) the chance of
becoming his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife?




<p/>CHAPTER XC.

<p/>HETTA``S SORROW.


<p/>When Hetta Carbury received that letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lover which was
given to the reader some chapters back, it certainly did not tend
in any way to alleviate her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) misery. Even when she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had read it over
half-a-dozen times, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could not bring herself to think it possible
that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could be reconciled to the man. It was not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
sinned against her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) by giving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) society to another woman to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had at any rate been engaged not long since, at the very time at
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was becoming engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>),--but also that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done this
in such a manner as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offence known to all her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) friends.
Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had been too quick;--but there was the fact that with
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own consent she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had acceded to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mother's demand that the man
should be rejected. The man had been rejected, and even Roger Carbury
knew that it was so. After this it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) thought, impossible that
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) should recall him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). But they should all know that her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) heart was
unchanged. Roger Carbury should certainly know that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ever asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) further question on the matter. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would never deny it; and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) knew that the man had behaved badly,--having entangled
himself with a nasty American woman,--yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be true to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as
far as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own heart was concerned.

<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been most unjust to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) injustice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not fill his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
letter with entreaties, but with reproaches. And certainly his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
reproaches moved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more than any prayer would have done. It was too
late now to remedy the evil; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not quite sure within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
own bosom that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not been unjust to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The more she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought
of it the more puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind became. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once been in love with Mrs. Hurtle, or because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
grounds for regarding Mrs. Hurtle as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) present rival? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hated
Mrs. Hurtle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was very angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever been
on affectionate terms with a woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hated;--but that had not been
the reason put forward by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for quarrelling with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Perhaps it
was true that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, had of late loved Mrs. Hurtle hardly better
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did herself. It might be that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been indeed constrained
by hard circumstances to go with the woman to Lowestoft. Having so
gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), it was no doubt right that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be rejected;--for
how can it be that a man who is engaged shall be allowed to travel
about the country with another woman to whom also he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was engaged a
few months back? But still there might be hardship in it. To her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to
Hetta herself, the circumstances were very hard. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved the man
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could look forward to no happiness in life
without him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But yet it must be so.

<p/>At the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to go to Mrs. Hurtle herself
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) wanted corroboration of the story as told by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could not and would not go to
Mrs. Hurtle. But when the letter had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) possession three or
four days,--unanswered, for, as a matter of course, no answer to it
from herself was possible,--and had been read and re-read till she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
knew every word of it by heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) began to think that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could
hear the story as it might be told by Mrs. Hurtle, a good deal that
was now dark might become light to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) continued to read the
letter, and to brood over it all, by degrees her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) anger was turned
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) lover to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) brother, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) cousin Roger.
Paul had of course behaved badly, very badly,--but had it not been
for them she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) might have had an opportunity of forgiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). They had
driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) on to the declaration of a purpose from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could
now see no escape. There had been a plot against her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was a
victim. In the first dismay and agony occasioned by that awful story
of the American woman,--which had, at the moment, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with
a horror which was now becoming less and less every hour,--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
fallen head foremost into the trap laid for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acknowledged to
herself that it was too late to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ground. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, at any
rate, almost sure that it must be too late. But yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was disposed
to do battle with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousin in the matter--if
only with the object of showing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not submit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
feelings to their control. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was savage to the point of rebellion
against all authority. Roger Carbury would of course think that
any communication between herself and Mrs. Hurtle must be most
improper,--altogether indelicate. Two or three days ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) thought
so herself. But the world was going so hard with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
was beginning to feel herself capable of throwing propriety and
delicacy to the winds. This man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had once accepted, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
altogether loved, and who, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faults, certainly
still loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>),--of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was beginning to have no further
doubt,--accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) of dishonesty, and referred her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) rival for
a corroboration of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would appeal to Mrs. Hurtle. The
woman was odious, abominable, a nasty intriguing American female. But
her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) lover desired that she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) should hear the woman's story; and she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)
would hear the story,--if the woman would tell it.

<p/>So resolving, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrote as follows to Mrs. Hurtle, finding great
difficulty in the composition of a letter which should tell neither
too little nor too much, and determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would be restrained
by no mock modesty, by no girlish fear of declaring the truth about
herself. The letter at last was stiff and hard, but it sufficed for
its purpose.


<p/>MADAM,--

<p/>Mr. Paul Montague has referred me to you as to certain
circumstances which have taken place between him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) and you.
It is right that I should tell you that I was a short time
since engaged to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), but that I have found myself
obliged to break off that engagement in consequence of
what I have been told as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) acquaintance with you. I
make this proposition to you, not thinking that anything
you will say to me can change my mind, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has
asked me to do so, and has, at the same time, accused me
of injustice towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). I do not wish to rest under
an accusation of injustice from one to whom I was once
warmly attached. If you will receive me, I will make it my
business to call any afternoon you may name.

<p/>Yours truly,

<p/>HENRIETTA CARBURY.


<p/>When the letter was written she (<font color='blue'><b>CARBURY</b></font>) was not only ashamed of it, but very
much afraid of it also. What if the American woman should put it in
a newspaper! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had heard that everything was put into newspapers
in America. What if this Mrs. Hurtle should send back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) some
horribly insolent answer;--or should send such answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother,
instead of herself! And then, again, if the American woman consented
to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), would not the American woman, as a matter of course,
trample upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with rough words? Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put the letter
aside, and almost determined that it should not be sent;--but at
last, with desperate fortitude, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took it out with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and posted
it herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told no word of it to any one. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
thought, had been cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), had disregarded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings, and
made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wretched for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother for sympathy
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) present distress. There was no friend who would sympathise
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must do everything alone.

<p/>Mrs. Hurtle, it will be remembered, had at last determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
would retire from the contest and own herself to have been worsted.
It is, I fear, impossible to describe adequately the various half
resolutions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) formed, and the changing phases of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mind
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) brought herself to this conclusion. And soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
assured herself that this should be the conclusion,--after she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
told Paul Montague that it should be so,--there came back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) at
times other half resolutions to a contrary effect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had written
a letter to the man threatening desperate revenge, and had then
abstained from sending it, and had then shown it to the man,--not
intending to give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a letter upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have to
act, but only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) might ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whether, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) received it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not deserved it. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had parted with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), refusing either to hear or to say a word of farewell, and had
told Mrs. Pipkin that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was no longer engaged to be married. At
that moment everything was done that could be done. The game had been
played and the stakes lost,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had schooled herself into such
restraint as to have abandoned all idea of vengeance. But from time
to time there arose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) heart a feeling that such softness was
unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>). Who had ever been soft to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)? Who had spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)?
Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) not long since found out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) must fight with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) very
nails and teeth for every inch of ground, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) did not mean to be
trodden into the dust? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) not held her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) own among rough people
after a very rough fashion, and should she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) now simply retire that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) might weep in a corner like a love-sick schoolgirl? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had
been so stoutly determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) would at any rate avenge her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) own
wrongs, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) could not turn those wrongs into triumph! There were
moments in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) could still seize the man by
the throat, where all the world might see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>), and dare him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to deny
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was false, perjured, and mean.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) received a long passionate letter from Paul Montague,
written at the same time as those other letters to Roger Carbury and
Hetta, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) all the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) engagement
to Hetta Carbury, and implored her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) to substantiate the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
own story. It was certainly marvellous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) that the man who had
so long been her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own lover and who had parted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) after such a
fashion should write such a letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). But it had no tendency to
increase either her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) anger or her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) sorrow. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had known that
it was so, and at certain times she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had told herself that it was only
natural,--had almost told herself that it was right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) and this
young Englishman were not fit to be mated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) thinking
a tame, sleek household animal, whereas she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) knew herself to be
wild,--fitter for the woods than for polished cities. It had been one
of the faults of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had allowed herself to be bound
by tenderness of feeling to this soft over-civilised man. The result
had been disastrous, as might have been expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was angry with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--almost to the extent of tearing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to pieces,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did not
become more angry because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) rival.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) only present friend was Mrs. Pipkin, who treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) with the
greatest deference, but who was never tired of asking questions about
the lost lover. <div class="bookquote">``That letter was from Mr. Montague?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin
on the morning after it had been received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you know that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure it was. One does get to know handwritings when letters come
frequent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was from him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). And why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear no;--why not certainly? I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)'d write every day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
life, so that things would come round again. Nothing ever troubles
me so much as broken love. Why don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) come again himself, Mrs.
Hurtle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not at all likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) should come again. It is all over,
and there is no good in talking of it. I shall return to New York on
Saturday week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Hurtle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't remain here, you know, all my life doing nothing. I came
over here for a certain purpose, and that has--gone by. Now I may
just go back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has ill-treated you. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not disposed to talk about it, Mrs. Pipkin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought it would have done you good to speak your mind
out free. I know it would me if I'd been served in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had anything to say at all after that fashion it would be to
the gentleman, and not to any other else. As it is I shall never
speak of it again to any one. You have been very kind to me, Mrs.
Pipkin, and I shall be sorry to leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Hurtle, you can't understand what it is to me. It isn't
only my feelings. The likes of me can't stand by their feelings
only, as their betters do. I've never been above telling you what a
godsend you've been to me this summer;--have I? I've paid everything,
butcher, baker, rates and all, just like clockwork. And now you're
going away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>Then Mrs. Pipkin began to sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I shall see Mr. Crumb before I go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) don't deserve it; do she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)? And even now she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) never says a word
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) that I call respectful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) looks on him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) as just being
better than Mrs. Buggins's children. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Buggins</b></font>)'ll be all right when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) has once got her (<font color='blue'><b>Buggins</b></font>) home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shall be all alone by myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
apron up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>It was after this that Mrs. Hurtle received Hetta's letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
as yet returned no answer to Paul Montague,--nor had she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) intended
to send any written answer. Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) to comply with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) request she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
could do so best by writing to the girl who was concerned rather than
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And though she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wrote no such letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) thought of it,--of
the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would use were she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) to write it, and of the tale which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would have to tell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) sat for hours thinking of it, trying to
resolve whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would tell the tale,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) told it at all,--in
a manner to suit Paul's purpose, or so as to bring that purpose
utterly to shipwreck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could cause the
shipwreck were she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) so minded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) could certainly have her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) revenge
after that fashion. But it was a woman's fashion, and, as such,
did not recommend itself to Mrs. Hurtle's feelings. A pistol or a
horsewhip, a violent seizing by the neck, with sharp taunts and
bitter-ringing words, would have made the fitting revenge. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
abandoned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could do herself no good by telling a story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
wrongs to another woman.

<p/>Then came Hetta's note, so stiff, so cold, so true,--so like the
letter of an Englishwoman, as Mrs. Hurtle said to herself. Mrs.
Hurtle smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) read the letter. <div class="bookquote">``I make this proposition not
thinking that anything you can say to me can change my mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>Of
course the girl's mind would be changed. The girl's mind, indeed,
required no change. Mrs. Hurtle could see well enough that the girl's
heart was set upon the man. Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did not doubt but
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could tell the story after such a fashion as to make it
impossible that the girl should marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chose to do so.

<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not answer the letter at all.
What was it to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? Let them fight their own lovers' battles out
after their own childish fashion. If the man meant at last to be
honest, there could be no doubt, Mrs. Hurtle thought, that the girl
would go to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It would require no interference of hers. But after
a while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might as well see this English chit who
had superseded herself in the affections of the Englishman she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
condescended to love. And if it were the case that all revenge was to
be abandoned, that no punishment was to be exacted in return for all
the injury that had been done, why should she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not say a kind word
so as to smooth away the existing difficulties? Wild cat as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was,
kindness was more congenial to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nature than cruelty. So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wrote
to Hetta making an appointment.


<p/>DEAR MISS CARBURY,--

<p/>If you could make it convenient to yourself to call here
either Thursday or Friday at any hour between two and
four, I shall be very happy to see you.

<p/>Yours sincerely,

<p/>WINIFRID HURTLE.




<p/>CHAPTER XCI.

<p/>THE RIVALS.


<p/>During these days the intercourse between Lady Carbury and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
daughter was constrained and far from pleasant. Hetta, thinking that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was ill-used, kept herself aloof, and would not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
mother of herself or of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) troubles. Lady Carbury watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>),
but not daring to say much, was at last almost frightened at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
girl's silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had assured herself, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found that Hetta
was disposed to quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lover and to send him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
brooch, that <div class="bookquote">``things would come round,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that Paul would be forgotten
quickly,--or laid aside as though he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) were forgotten,--and that Hetta
would soon perceive it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) interest to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) cousin. With
such a prospect before her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), Lady Carbury thought it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) duty
as a mother to show no tendency to sympathise with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) girl's sorrow.
Such heart-breakings were occurring daily in the world around them.
Who were the happy people that were driven neither by ambition, nor
poverty, nor greed, nor the cross purposes of unhappy love, to stifle
and trample upon their feelings? She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had known no one so blessed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had never been happy after that fashion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) herself had within
the last few weeks refused to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lot with that of a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
really liked, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wicked son was so grievous a burden on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
shoulders. A woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) were unfortunate enough to be
a lady without wealth of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own, must give up everything, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) body,
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart,--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very soul if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were that way troubled,--to the
procuring of a fitting maintenance for herself. Why should Hetta hope
to be more fortunate than others? And then the position which chance
now offered to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was fortunate. This cousin of hers, who was so
devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), was in all respects good. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not torture her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by
harsh restraint and cruel temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not
spend his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) money foolishly. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would allow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) all the belongings of
a fair, free life. Lady Carbury reiterated to herself the assertion
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was manifestly doing a mother's duty by her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) endeavours to
constrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) girl to marry such a man. With a settled purpose she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
was severe and hard. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found how harsh her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter could
be in response to this,--how gloomy, how silent, and how severe in
retaliation,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was almost frightened at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) herself was
doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not known how stern and how enduring her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter
could be. <div class="bookquote">``Hetta,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``why don't you speak to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>On this
very day it was Hetta's purpose to visit Mrs. Hurtle at Islington.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had said no word of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) intention to any one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had chosen
the Friday because on that day she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother would go in the
afternoon to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) publisher. There should be no deceit. Immediately
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) return she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had done. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
considered herself to be emancipated from control. Among them they
had robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had submitted to the robbery, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would submit to nothing else. <div class="bookquote">``Hetta, why don't you speak to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, mamma, there is nothing we can talk about without making
each other unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a dreadful thing to say! Is there no subject in the world to
interest you except that wretched young man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None other at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta obstinately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What folly it is,--I will not say only to speak like that, but to
allow yourself to entertain such thoughts!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I to control my thoughts? Do you think, mamma, that after
I had owned to you that I loved a man,--after I had owned it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and, worst of all, to myself,--I could have myself separated from
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and then not think about it? It is a cloud upon everything. It
is as though I had lost my eyesight and my speech. It is as it would

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an accusation in this allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) brother which the
mother felt,--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was intended to feel it,--but to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could
make no reply. It accused her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) of being too much concerned for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son
to feel any real affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter. <div class="bookquote">``You are ignorant of the
world, Hetta,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am having a lesson in it now, at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think it is worse than others have suffered before you? In
what little you see around you do you think that girls are generally
able to marry the men upon whom they set their hearts?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) paused,
but Hetta made no answer to this. <div class="bookquote">``Marie Melmotte was as warmly
attached to your brother as you can be to Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marie Melmotte!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) thinks as much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) feelings as you do of yours. The truth is
you are indulging a dream. You must wake from it, and shake yourself,
and find out that you, like others, have got to do the best you can
for yourself in order that you may live. The world at large has to
eat dry bread, and cannot get cakes and sweetmeats. A girl, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
thinks of giving herself to a husband, has to remember this. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
has a fortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can pick and choose, but if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) have
none she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must allow herself to be chosen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then a girl is to marry without stopping even to think whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
likes the man or not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should teach herself to like the man, if the marriage be

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta, getting up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) seat, <div class="bookquote">``you may as well
believe me. No earthly inducement shall ever make me marry my cousin
Roger. It is to me horrible that you should propose it to me when you
know that I love that other man with my whole heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you speak so of one who has treated you with the utmost
contumely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of any contumely. What reason have I to be offended
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has liked a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever saw me? It
has been unfortunate, wretched, miserable; but I do not know that I
have any right whatever to be angry with Mr. Paul Montague.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Having
so spoken she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) walked out of the room without waiting for a further
reply.

<p/>It was all very sad to Lady Carbury. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) perceived now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter to pronounce an absolution of Paul Montague's
sins, and that in this way she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had lessened and loosened the barrier
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had striven to construct between them. But that which
pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) most was the unrealistic, romantic view of life which
pervaded all Hetta's thoughts. How was any girl to live in this world
who could not be taught the folly of such idle dreams?

<p/>That afternoon Hetta trusted herself all alone to the mysteries of
the Marylebone underground railway, and emerged with accuracy at
King's Cross. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had studied her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) geography, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) walked from
thence to Islington. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew well the name of the street and the
number at which Mrs. Hurtle lived. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) reached the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
did not at first dare to stand and raise the knocker. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) passed on
to the end of the silent, vacant street, endeavouring to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
thoughts, striving to find and to arrange the words with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
would commence her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) strange petition. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) endeavoured to dictate
to herself some defined conduct should the woman be insolent to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Personally she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not a coward, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doubted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) power of
replying to a rough speech. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could at any rate escape. Should the
worst come to the worst, the woman would hardly venture to impede
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) departure. Having gone to the end of the street, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returned
with a very quick step and knocked at the door. It was opened almost
immediately by Ruby Ruggles, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh laws,--Miss Carbury!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby, looking up into the stranger's
face. <div class="bookquote">``Yes;--sure enough she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be Felix's sister.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>But Ruby did
not dare to ask any question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had admitted to all around her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
that Sir Felix should not be her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) lover any more, and that John Crumb
should be allowed to return. But, nevertheless, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) heart twittered
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) showed Miss Carbury up to the lodger's sitting-room.

<p/>Though it was midsummer Hetta entered the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) veil down.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) adjusted it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) followed Ruby up the stairs, moved by a sudden
fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) rival's scrutiny. Mrs. Hurtle rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) chair and
came forward to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) visitor, putting out both her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hands to do
so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was dressed with the most scrupulous care,--simply, and in
black, without an ornament of any kind, without a ribbon or a chain
or a flower. But with some woman's purpose at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had so
attired herself as to look her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) very best. Was it that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would vindicate to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rival their joint lover's first
choice, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was minded to teach the English girl that an
American woman might have graces of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own? As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came forward she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was gentle and soft in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) movements, and a pleasant smile played
round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth. Hetta at the first moment was almost dumbfounded by
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty,--by that and by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ease and exquisite self-possession.
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Carbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said with that low, rich voice which in old
days had charmed Paul almost as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) loveliness, <div class="bookquote">``I need not
tell you how interested I am in seeing you. May I not ask you to
lay aside your veil, so that we may look at each other fairly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Hetta, dumbfounded, not knowing how to speak a word, stood gazing
at the woman when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had removed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) veil. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had no personal
description of Mrs. Hurtle, but had expected something very different
from this! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had thought that the woman would be coarse and big,
with fine eyes and a bright colour. As it was they were both of
the same complexion, both dark, with hair nearly black, with eyes
of the same colour. Hetta thought of all that at the moment,--but
acknowledged to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no pretension to beauty such as
that which this woman owned. <div class="bookquote">``And so you have come to see me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Hurtle. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down so that I may look at you. I am glad that you
have come to see me, Miss Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I be angry? Had the idea been distasteful to me I should

badly to you also. Is it so? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) is no longer mine, and you may ask me
freely for aid, if there be any that I can give you. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) were an
American I should say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had behaved badly to me;--but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) is
an Englishman perhaps it is different. Now tell me;--what can I do,
or what can I say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) told me that you could tell me the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What truth? I will certainly tell you nothing that is not true. You

be full of youthful ardour one day, and cautious as old age itself
the next. But I do not suppose that there has been need for such
caution with you. What is it, Miss Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta found the telling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) story to be very difficult. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you were here, and I knew nothing of it. Of course I should have

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That there was such a woman as Winifrid Hurtle interfering with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not so sure of that. Shall I tell you what I think? I think
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) has been unjust to me, and that therefore your injustice to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) is no more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) due. I cannot plead for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), Miss Carbury.
To me he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) has been the last and worst of a long series of, I think,
undeserved misfortune. But whether you will avenge my wrongs must be
for you to decide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) go with you to Lowestoft?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>),--and because, like many men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) cannot be
ill-natured although he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) can be cruel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) would have given a hand not
to have gone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) could not say me nay. As you have come here,
Miss Carbury, you may as well know the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) did love me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>)
had been talked out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) love by my enemies and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) own friends
long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had ever seen you. I am almost ashamed to tell you my
own part of the story, and yet I know not why I should be ashamed. I
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) here to England--because I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>). I came after him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>),
as perhaps a woman should not do, because I was true of heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had
told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) did not want me;--but I wanted to be wanted, and I
hoped that I might lure him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) troth. I have utterly failed,
and I must return to my own country,--I will not say a broken-hearted
woman, for I will not admit of such a condition,--but a creature with
a broken spirit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) has misused me foully, and I have simply forgiven
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>); not because I am a Christian, but because I am not strong enough
to punish one that I still love. I could not put a dagger into
him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>),--or I would; or a bullet,--or I would. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) has reduced me to a
nothing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) falseness, and yet I cannot injure him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)! I, who have
sworn to myself that no man should ever lay a finger on me in scorn
without feeling my wrath in return, I cannot punish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But if you
choose to do so it is not for me to set you against such an act of
justice.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) paused and looked up to Hetta as though expecting
a reply.

<p/>But Hetta had no reply to make. All had been said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had come
to hear. Every word that the woman had spoken had in truth been a
comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had told herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visit was to be made in
order that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be justified in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) condemnation of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had believed that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) intention to arm herself with proof
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had done right in rejecting him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was told that
however false her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover might have been to this other woman he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had
been absolutely true to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The woman had not spoken kindly of
Paul,--had seemed to intend to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) with the utmost severity;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had so spoken as to acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) of all sin against Hetta.
What was it to Hetta that her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lover had been false to this American
stranger? It did not seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to be at all necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
should be angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lover on that head. Mrs. Hurtle had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) herself must decide whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would take upon herself to
avenge her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) rival's wrongs. In saying that Mrs. Hurtle had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
to feel that there were no other wrongs which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) need avenge. It was
all done now. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could only thank the woman for the pleasantness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) demeanour, and then go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could, when alone, make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
mind as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would do next. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had not yet told herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
would submit herself again to Paul Montague. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had only told
herself that, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own breast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was bound to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>rival</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You have been very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said at last,--speaking only because
it was necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) should say something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well that there should be some kindness where there has been
so much that is unkind. Forgive me, Miss Carbury, if I speak plainly
to you. Of course you will go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Of course you will be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife. You have told me that you love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dearly, as plainly as I have
told you the same story of myself. Your coming here would of itself
have declared it, even if I did not see your satisfaction at my
account of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treachery to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Hurtle, do not say that of me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is true, and I do not in the least quarrel with you on that
account. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has preferred you to me, and as far as I am concerned
there is an end of it. You are a girl, whereas I am a woman,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
likes your youth. I have undergone the cruel roughness of the world,
which has not as yet touched you; and therefore you are softer to the
touch. I do not know that you are very superior in other attractions;
but that has sufficed, and you are the victor. I am strong enough
to acknowledge that I have nothing to forgive in you;--and am weak
enough to forgive all his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) treachery.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta was now holding the woman
by the hand, and was weeping, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew not why. <div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to
have seen you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Hurtle, <div class="bookquote">``so that I may know what his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>)
wife was like. In a few days I shall return to the States, and then
neither of you will ever be troubled further by Winifrid Hurtle. Tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) will come and see me once before I go, I will not be
more unkind to him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) than I can help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div><p/>When Hetta did not decline to be the bearer of this message she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
must have at any rate resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would see Paul Montague
again,--and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>rival</b></font>) would be to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>rival</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was again his (<font color='blue'><b>rival</b></font>)
own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) now got herself quickly out of the room, absolutely kissing
the woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had both dreaded and despised. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
alone in the street she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried to think of it all. How full of beauty
was the face of that American female,--how rich and glorious her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)
voice in spite of a slight taint of the well-known nasal twang;--and
above all how powerful and at the same time how easy and how gracious
was her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) manner! That she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) would be an unfit wife for Paul Montague was
certain to Hetta, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) or any man should have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) and
have been loved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), and then have been willing to part from her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),
was wonderful. And yet Paul Montague had preferred herself, Hetta
Carbury, to this woman! Paul had certainly done well for his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
cause when he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had referred the younger lady to the elder.

<p/>Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own quarrel of course there must be an end. She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been
unjust to the man, and injustice must of course be remedied by
repentance and confession. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) walked quickly back to the railway
station she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brought herself to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lover more fondly than she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
had ever done. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had been true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) from the first hour of their
acquaintance. What truth higher than that has any woman a right to
desire? No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) a virgin heart. No other man had
ever touched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips, or been allowed to press her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, or to look
into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes with unrebuked admiration. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pride to give
herself to the man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved after this fashion, pure and white as
snow on which no foot has trodden. But in taking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), all that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
wanted was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be true to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now and henceforward. The
future must be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own work. As to the <div class="bookquote">``now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt that Mrs.
Hurtle had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) sufficient assurance.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) must at once let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother know this change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mind. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) re-entered the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was no longer sullen, no longer anxious
to be silent, very willing to be gracious if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) might be received
with favour,--but quite determined that nothing should shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) went at once into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother's room, having heard from
the boy at the door that Lady Carbury had returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hetta, wherever have you been?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I mean to write to Mr. Montague and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) that
I have been unjust to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hetta, you must do nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, rising
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mamma. I have been unjust, and I must do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) to come back to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mamma:--that is what I mean. I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) will
come, I will receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) will come. Oh, mamma, let us be
friends, and I will tell you everything. Why should you grudge me my
love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) brooch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury hoarsely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) shall give it me again. Hear what I have done. I have seen that
American lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Hurtle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--I have been to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a wonderful woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has told you wonderful lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lie to me? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has told me no lies. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said nothing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) favour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can well believe that. What can any one say in his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) favour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me that which has assured me that Mr. Montague has
never behaved badly to me. I shall write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) at once. If you like
I will show you the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), I will tear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury, full of anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I have told you everything, but in this I must judge for
myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Then Hetta, seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother would not relent, left
the room without further speech, and immediately opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) desk that
the letter might be written.




<p/>CHAPTER XCII.

<p/>HAMILTON K. FISKER AGAIN.


<p/>Ten days had passed since the meeting narrated in the last
chapter,--ten days, during which Hetta's letter had been sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
lover, but in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had received no reply,--when two gentlemen
met each other in a certain room in Liverpool, who were seen together
in the same room in the early part of this chronicle. These were our
young friend Paul Montague, and our not much older friend Hamilton
K. Fisker. Melmotte had died on the 18th of July, and tidings of the
event had been at once sent by telegraph to San Francisco. Some weeks
before this Montague had written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) partner, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) account
of the South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway Company,--describing
its condition in England as he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) then believed it to be,--and urging
Fisker to come over to London. On receipt of a message from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
American correspondent he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had gone down to Liverpool, and had
there awaited Fisker's arrival, taking counsel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) friend
Mr. Ramsbottom. In the mean time Hetta's letter was lying at the
Beargarden, Paul having written from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) club and having omitted to
desire that the answer should be sent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) lodgings. Just at this
moment things at the Beargarden were not well managed. They were
indeed so ill managed that Paul never received that letter,--which
would have had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) charms greater than those of any letter ever
before written.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a terrible business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>said Fisker, immediately on entering
the room in which Montague was waiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was the last man I'd
have thought would be cut up in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was utterly ruined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) wouldn't have been ruined,--and couldn't have thought so if he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)'d
known all he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) ought to have known. The South Central would have pulled
him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) through a`most anything if he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)'d have understood how to play it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't think much of the South Central here now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah;--that's because you've never above half spirit enough for a big
thing. You nibble at it instead of swallowing it whole,--and then, of
course, folks see that you're only nibbling. I thought that Melmotte
would have had spirit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is, I fear, no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) had committed forgery. It was the
dread of detection as to that which drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to destroy himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call it dam clumsy from beginning to end;--dam clumsy. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
to be a different man, and I feel more than half ashamed of myself
because I trusted such a fellow. That chap Cohenlupe has got off with
a lot of swag. Only think of Melmotte allowing Cohenlupe to get the
better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cohenlupe</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose the thing will be broken up now at San Francisco,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>suggested Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bu`st up at Frisco! Not if I know it. Why should it be bu`st up?
D'you think we're all going to smash there because a fool like
Melmotte blows his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) brains out in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) took poison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or p`ison either. That's not just our way. I'll tell you what I'm
going to do; and why I'm over here so uncommon sharp. These shares
are at a`most nothing now in London. I'll buy every share in the
market. I wired for as many as I dar'd, so as not to spoil our own
game, and I'll make a clean sweep of every one of them. Bu`st up! I'm
sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) because I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) a biggish man;--but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s
done 'll just be the making of us over there. Will you get out of it,
or will you come back to Frisco with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div><p/>In answer to this Paul asserted most strenuously that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) would
not return to San Francisco, and, perhaps too ingenuously, gave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) partner to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was altogether sick of the great
railway, and would under no circumstances have anything more to
do with it. Fisker shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) shoulders, and was not displeased
at the proposed rupture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was prepared to deal fairly,--nay,
generously,--by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) partner, having recognised the wisdom of that
great commercial rule which teaches us that honour should prevail
among associates of a certain class; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had fully convinced
himself that Paul Montague was not a fit partner for Hamilton K.
Fisker. Fisker was not only unscrupulous himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had a
thorough contempt for scruples in others. According to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) theory of
life, nine hundred and ninety-nine men were obscure because of their
scruples, whilst the thousandth man predominated and cropped up into
the splendour of commercial wealth because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was free from such
bondage. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own theories, too, as to commercial honesty. That
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had promised to do he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do, if it was within his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was anxious that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bond should be good, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word equally
so. But the work of robbing mankind in gross by magnificently false
representations, was not only the duty, but also the delight and the
ambition of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. How could a man so great endure a partnership
with one so small as Paul Montague? <div class="bookquote">``And now what about Winifrid
Hurtle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>asked Fisker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you ask? She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s in London, and Hurtle's at Frisco, swearing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'ll come after her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) would, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hasn't got the dollars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s not dead then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>muttered Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead!--no, nor likely to die. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'ll have a bad time of it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) divorced him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) got a Kansas lawyer to say so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)'s got a Frisco lawyer to
say that there's nothing of the kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) hasn't played her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) game
badly neither, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)'s had the handling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) own money, and has
put it so that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) can't get hold of a dollar. Even if it suited other
ways, you know, I wouldn't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) myself till I saw my way clearer
out of the wood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not thinking of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>),--if you mean that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a talk about it in Frisco;--that's all. And I have heard
Hurtle say when he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was a little farther gone than usual that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
here with you, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) meant to drop in on you some of these
days.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>To this Paul made no answer, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had now both
heard enough and said enough about Mrs. Hurtle.

<p/>On the following day the two men, who were still partners, went
together to London, and Fisker immediately became immersed in the
arrangement of Melmotte's affairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) put himself into communication
with Mr. Brehgert, went in and out of the offices in Abchurch
Lane and the rooms which had belonged to the Railway Company,
cross-examined Croll, mastered the books of the Company as far as
they were to be mastered, and actually summoned both the Grendalls,
father and son, up to London. Lord Alfred, and Miles with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), had
left London a day or two before Melmotte's death,--having probably
perceived that there was no further occasion for their services. To
Fisker's appeal Lord Alfred was proudly indifferent. Who was this
American that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) should call upon a director of the London Company
to appear? Does not every one know that a director of a company need
not direct unless he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) pleases? Lord Alfred, therefore, did not even
condescend to answer Fisker's letter;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) advised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) son to run
up to town. <div class="bookquote">``I should just go, because I'd taken a salary from the
d-- Company,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the careful father, <div class="bookquote">``but when there I wouldn't
say a word.''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>So Miles Grendall, obeying his (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) parent, reappeared upon
the scene.

<p/>But Fisker's attention was perhaps most usefully and most sedulously
paid to Madame Melmotte and her (<font color='blue'><b>parent</b></font>) daughter. Till Fisker arrived no one
had visited them in their solitude at Hampstead, except Croll, the
clerk. Mr. Brehgert had abstained, thinking that a widow, who had
become a widow under such terrible circumstances, would prefer to be
alone. Lord Nidderdale had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) adieux, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) could do
no more. It need hardly be said that Lord Alfred had too much good
taste to interfere at such a time, although for some months he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) had
been domestically intimate with the poor woman, or that Sir Felix
would not be prompted by the father's death to renew his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suit to
the daughter. But Fisker had not been two days in London before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) went out to Hampstead, and was admitted to Madame Melmotte's
presence;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had not been there four days before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was aware
that in spite of all misfortunes, Marie Melmotte was still the
undoubted possessor of a large fortune.

<p/>In regard to Melmotte's effects generally the Crown had been induced
to abstain from interfering,--giving up the right to all the man's
plate and chairs and tables which it had acquired by the finding of
the coroner's verdict,--not from tenderness to Madame Melmotte, for
whom no great commiseration was felt, but on behalf of such creditors
as poor Mr. Longestaffe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) son. But Marie's money was quite
distinct from this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been right in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own belief as to
this property, and had been right, too, in refusing to sign those
papers,--unless it may be that that refusal led to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father's act.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) herself was sure that it was not so, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had withdrawn
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) refusal, and had offered to sign the papers before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father's
death. What might have been the ultimate result had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) done so when
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first made the request, no one could now say. That the money
would have gone there could be no doubt. The money was now hers,--a
fact which Fisker soon learned with that peculiar cleverness which
belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>).

<p/>Poor Madame Melmotte felt the visits of the American to be a relief
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) misery. The world makes great mistakes as to that
which is and is not beneficial to those whom Death has bereaved of
a companion. It may be, no doubt sometimes it is the case, that
grief shall be so heavy, so absolutely crushing, as to make any
interference with it an additional trouble, and this is felt also in
acute bodily pain, and in periods of terrible mental suffering. It
may also be, and, no doubt, often is the case, that the bereaved one
chooses to affect such overbearing sorrow, and that friends abstain,
because even such affectation has its own rights and privileges. But
Madame Melmotte was neither crushed by grief nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) affect to
be so crushed. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been numbed by the suddenness and by the awe
of the catastrophe. The man who had been her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) merciless tyrant for
years, who had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to be a very incarnation of cruel power,
had succumbed, and shown himself to be powerless against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
misfortunes. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was a woman of very few words, and had spoken almost
none on this occasion even to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own daughter; but when Fisker came
to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had ever known before of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
husband's affairs, and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) future life, and mixed for
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a small glass of brandy-and-water warm, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that Frisco
would be the fittest place for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) future residence, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) certainly
did not find him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) to be intrusive.

<p/>And even Marie liked Fisker, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been wooed and almost
won both by a lord and a baronet, and had understood, if not much,
at least more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mother, of the life to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been
introduced. There was something of real sorrow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) heart for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was prone to love,--though, perhaps, not prone to deep
affection. Melmotte had certainly been often cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
had also been very indulgent. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had never been specially
grateful for the one, so neither had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) ever specially resented the
other. Tenderness, care, real solicitude for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) well-being, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
had never known, and had come to regard the unevenness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) life,
vacillating between knocks and knick-knacks, with a blow one day and
a jewel the next, as the condition of things which was natural to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). When her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father was dead she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) remembered for a while the jewels
and the knick-knacks, and forgot the knocks and blows. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
was not beyond consolation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) also found consolation in Mr.
Fisker's visits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to sign a paper every quarter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said to Fisker, as they
were walking together one evening in the lanes round Hampstead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to do the same now, only instead of giving the paper to
any one you'll have to leave it in a banker's hands to draw the money
for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And can that be done over in California?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just the same as here. Your bankers will manage it all for you
without the slightest trouble. For the matter of that I'll do it,
if you'll trust me. There's only one thing against it all, Miss
Melmotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After the sort of society you've been used to here, I don't know how
you'll get on among us Americans. We're a pretty rough lot, I guess.
Though, perhaps, what you lose in the look of the fruit, you'll make
up in the flavour.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>This Fisker said in a somewhat plaintive tone,
as though fearing that the manifest substantial advantages of Frisco
would not suffice to atone for the loss of that fashion to which Miss
Melmotte had been used.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate swells,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie, flashing round upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like poison. What's the use of 'em? They never mean a word that they
say,--and they don't say so many words either. They're never more
than half awake, and don't care the least about anybody. I hate
London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether you'd hate Frisco?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather think it would be a jolly sort of place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very jolly I find it. And I wonder whether you'd hate--me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fisker, that's nonsense. Why should I hate anybody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do. I've found out one or two that you don't love. If you
do come to Frisco, I hope you won't just hate me, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) gently by the arm;--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), whisking herself away rapidly,
bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) behave himself. Then they returned to their lodgings, and
Mr. Fisker, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) went back to London, mixed a little warm
brandy-and-water for Madame Melmotte. I think that upon the whole
Madame Melmotte was more comfortable at Hampstead than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had
been either in Grosvenor Square or Bruton Street, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was
certainly not a thing beautiful to look at in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) widow's weeds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think much of you as a book-keeper, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>Fisker said
to Miles Grendall in the now almost deserted Board-room of the
South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway. Miles, remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
father's advice, answered not a word, but merely looked with assumed
amazement at the impertinent stranger who dared thus to censure his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
performances. Fisker had made three or four remarks previous to
this, and had appealed both to Paul Montague and to Croll, who were
present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) had invited also the attendance of Sir Felix Carbury,
Lord Nidderdale, and Mr. Longestaffe, who were all Directors;--but
none of them had come. Sir Felix had paid no attention to Fisker's
letter. Lord Nidderdale had written a short but characteristic reply.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear Mr. Fisker,--I really don't know anything about it. Yours,
Nidderdale.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Longestaffe/Adolphus/Adolphus Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>Mr. Longestaffe, with laborious zeal, had closely
covered four pages with his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) reasons for non-attendance, with which
the reader shall not be troubled, and which it may be doubted whether
even Fisker perused to the end. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>continued Fisker,
<div class="bookquote">``it's astonishing to me that Melmotte should have put up with this
kind of thing. I suppose you understand something of business, Mr.
Croll?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It vas not my department, Mr. Fisker,''  (<font color='red'><b>the German</b></font>)</div>said the German.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor anybody else's either,''  (<font color='red'><b>the American</b></font>)</div>said the domineering American. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course it's on the cards, Mr. Grendall, that we shall have to put you
into a witness-box, because there are certain things we must get at.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>Miles was silent as the grave, but at once made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
would pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) autumn at some pleasant but economical German retreat,
and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) autumnal retirement should be commenced within a very
few days;--or perhaps hours might suffice.

<p/>But Fisker was not in earnest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) threat. In truth the greater
the confusion in the London office, the better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) thought, were the
prospects of the Company at San Francisco. Miles underwent purgatory
on this occasion for three or four hours, and when dismissed had
certainly revealed none of Melmotte's secrets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) did, however, go
to Germany, finding that a temporary absence from England would be
comfortable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) in more respects than one,--and need not be heard
of again in these pages.

<p/>When Melmotte's affairs were ultimately wound up there was found to
be nearly enough of property to satisfy all his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) proved liabilities.
Very many men started up with huge claims, asserting that they had
been robbed, and in the confusion it was hard to ascertain who had
been robbed, or who had simply been unsuccessful in their attempts to
rob others. Some, no doubt, as was the case with poor Mr. Brehgert,
had speculated in dependence on Melmotte's sagacity, and had lost
heavily without dishonesty. But of those who, like the Longestaffes,
were able to prove direct debts, the condition at last was not very
sad. Our excellent friend Dolly got his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) money early in the day, and
was able, under Mr. Squercum's guidance, to start himself on a new
career. Having paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) debts, and with still a large balance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>)
bankers', he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) assured his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) friend Nidderdale that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) meant to turn over
an entirely new leaf. <div class="bookquote">``I shall just make Squercum allow me so much a
month, and I shall have all the bills and that kind of thing sent to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) will do everything, and pull me up if I'm getting wrong.
I like Squercum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) rob you, old fellow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>suggested Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) will;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) won't let any one else do it. One has
to be plucked, but it's everything to have it done on a system. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>)'ll only let me have ten shillings out of every sovereign I think
I can get along.''  (<font color='red'><b>Squercum/Mr. Squercum/MR. SQUERCUM</b></font>)</div>Let us hope that Mr. Squercum was merciful, and
that Dolly was enabled to live in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) virtuous
resolutions.

<p/>But these things did not arrange themselves till late in the
winter,--long after Mr. Fisker's departure for California. That,
however, was protracted till a day much later than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had anticipated
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had become intimate with Madame Melmotte and Marie. Madame
Melmotte's affairs occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) for a while almost exclusively. The
furniture and plate were of course sold for the creditors, but Madame
Melmotte was allowed to take whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) declared to be specially
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own property;--and, though much was said about the jewels, no
attempt was made to recover them. Marie advised Madame Melmotte to
give them up, assuring the old woman that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) should have whatever
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) wanted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) maintenance. But it was not likely that Melmotte's
widow would willingly abandon any property, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) did not abandon
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) jewels. It was agreed between her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) and Fisker that they were to
be taken to New York. <div class="bookquote">``You'll get as much there as in London, if you
like to part with them; and nobody 'll say anything about it there.
You couldn't sell a locket or a chain here without all the world
talking about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Melmotte</b></font>)</div><p/>In all these things Madame Melmotte put herself into Fisker's hands
with the most absolute confidence,--and, indeed, with a confidence
that was justified by its results. It was not by robbing an old woman
that Fisker intended to make himself great. To Madame Melmotte's
thinking, Fisker was the finest gentleman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had ever met,--so
infinitely pleasanter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) manner than Lord Alfred even when Lord
Alfred had been most gracious, with so much more to say for himself
than Miles Grendall, understanding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so much better than any man
had ever done,--especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with those small warm
beakers of sweet brandy-and-water. <div class="bookquote">``I shall do whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) tells me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said to Marie. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I've nothing to keep me here in this
country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm willing to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to stay in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you'll take him (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grendall</b></font>) asks you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie Melmotte/MARIE MELMOTTE</b></font>)</div>said Marie. <div class="bookquote">``A man may be very
well without one's wanting to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I don't think I'll marry
anybody. What's the use? It's only money. Nobody cares for anything
else. Fisker's all very well; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) only wants the money. Do you
think Fisker'd ask me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) if I hadn't got anything? Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) ain't slow enough for that.''

<p/>CHAPTER XCIII.

<p/>A TRUE LOVER.


<p/>Hetta Carbury, out of the fulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) heart, having made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been unjust to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lover, wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) a letter
full of penitence, full of love, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) at great length all
the details of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) meeting with Mrs. Hurtle, and bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) come
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and bring the brooch with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). But this letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had
unfortunately addressed to the Beargarden, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
from that club; and partly through his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own fault, and partly through
the demoralisation of that once perfect establishment, the letter
never reached his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hands. When, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) returned to London he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
was justified in supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had refused even to notice his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
appeal. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was, however, determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would still make further
struggles. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) felt, to contend with many difficulties. Mrs.
Hurtle, Roger Carbury, and Hetta's mother were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought, all
inimical to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). Mrs. Hurtle, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would
not rage as a lioness, could hardly be his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) friend in the matter.
Roger had repeatedly declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) determination to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) as
a traitor. And Lady Carbury, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) well knew, had always been and
always would be opposed to the match. But Hetta had owned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), had submitted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) caresses, and had been proud of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) admiration. And Paul, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) did not probably analyze very
carefully the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) beloved, still felt instinctively
that, having so far prevailed with such a girl, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) prospects could
not be altogether hopeless. And yet how should he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) continue the
struggle? With what weapons should he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) carry on the fight? The writing
of letters is but a one-sided, troublesome proceeding, when the
person to whom they are written will not answer them; and the calling
at a door at which the servant has been instructed to refuse a
visitor admission, becomes, disagreeable,--if not degrading,--after a
time.

<p/>But Hetta had written a second epistle,--not to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover, but to one
who received his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) letters with more regularity. When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rashly and
with precipitate wrath quarrelled with Paul Montague, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) at once
communicated the fact to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) mother, and through her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
cousin Roger. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would not recognise Roger as a lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
did acknowledge him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to be the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) family, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own special
friend, and entitled in some special way to know all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) herself
did, and all that was done in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) therefore wrote to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) cousin, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had made a mistake about Paul, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was convinced that Paul had always behaved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) with absolute
sincerity, and, in short, that Paul was the best, and dearest, and
most ill-used of human beings. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) enthusiasm she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) went on to
declare that there could be no other chance of happiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in
this world than that of becoming Paul's wife, and to beseech her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
dearest friend and cousin Roger not to turn against her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>), but to lend
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) an aiding hand. There are those whom strong words in letters
never affect at all,--who, perhaps, hardly read them, and take what
they do read as meaning no more than half what is said. But Roger
Carbury was certainly not one of these. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sat on the garden wall
at Carbury, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin's letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) words had
their full weight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not try to convince himself
that all this was the verbiage of an enthusiastic girl, who might
soon be turned and trained to another mode of thinking by fitting
admonitions. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) read and re-read Hetta's letter
sitting on the wall, there was not at any rate further hope for
himself. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was altogether unchanged himself, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was
altogether incapable of change,--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not rally himself
sufficiently to look forward to even a passive enjoyment of life
without the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had loved,--yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) told himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
believed to be the truth. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) owned directly and plainly that,
whether happy or unhappy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) must do without her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had let time
slip by with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) too fast and too far before he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had ventured to love.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) must now stomach his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) disappointment, and make the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could
of such a broken, ill-conditioned life as was left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). But, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) acknowledged this,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did acknowledge it,--in what fashion
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in future treat the man and woman who had reduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) so
low?

<p/>At this moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind was tuned to high thoughts. If it were
possible he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would be unselfish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not, indeed, bring himself
to think with kindness of Paul Montague. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not say to himself
that the man had not been treacherous to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgive
the man's supposed treason. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did tell himself very plainly that
in comparison with Hetta the man was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It could hardly
be worth his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) while to maintain a quarrel with the man if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were once
able to assure Hetta that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), as the wife of another man, should
still be dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a friend might be dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was well aware
that such assurance, such forgiveness, must contain very much. If it
were to be so, Hetta's child must take the name of Carbury, and must
be to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heir,--as near as possible his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own child. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
favour he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must throw aside that law of primogeniture which to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
so sacred that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been hitherto minded to make Sir Felix his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heir
in spite of the absolute unfitness of the wretched young man. All
this must be changed, should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be able to persuade himself to give
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consent to the marriage. In such case Carbury must be the home
of the married couple, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could induce them to make it
so. There must be born the future infant to whose existence he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
already looking forward with some idea that in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old age he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
there find comfort. In such case, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should never again be
able to love Paul Montague in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart of hearts, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must live
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) sake on affectionate terms. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must forgive Hetta
altogether,--as though there had been no fault; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must strive to
forgive the man's fault as best he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might. Struggling as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to be
generous, passionately fond as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was of justice, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know
how to be just himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not see that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in truth had been to
no extent ill-used. And ever and again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of the great
prayer as to the forgiveness of trespasses, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not refrain from
asking himself whether it could really be intended that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
forgive such trespass as that committed against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by Paul Montague!
Nevertheless, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose from the wall he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had resolved that Hetta
should be pardoned entirely, and that Paul Montague should be treated
as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were pardoned. As for himself,--the chances of the world
had been unkind to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would submit to them!

<p/>Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote no answer to Hetta's letter. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt,
with some undefined but still existing hope, that the writing of such
a letter would deprive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last chance. Hetta's letter to
himself hardly required an immediate answer,--did not, indeed, demand
any answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had simply told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that, whereas she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had for certain
reasons quarrelled with the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had loved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had now come to
the conclusion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had
asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) cousin's assent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own views, but that, as Roger
felt, was to be given rather by the discontinuance of opposition than
by any positive action. Roger's influence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) mother was the
assistance which Hetta really wanted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and that influence
could hardly be given by the writing of any letter. Thinking of all
this, Roger determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would again go up to London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would
have the vacant hours of the journey in which to think of it all
again, and tell himself whether it was possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
heart to agree to the marriage;--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would see the people,
and perhaps learn something further from their manner and their
words, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) finally committed himself to the abandonment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
own hopes and the completion of theirs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) went up to town, and I do not know that those vacant hours served
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) much. To a man not accustomed to thinking there is nothing in
the world so difficult as to think. After some loose fashion we turn
over things in our mind and ultimately reach some decision, guided
probably by our feelings at the last moment rather than by any
process of ratiocination;--and then we think that we have thought.
But to follow out one argument to an end, and then to found on the
base so reached the commencement of another, is not common to us.
Such a process was hardly within the compass of Roger's mind,--who
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was made wretched by the dust, and by a female who had a
basket of objectionable provisions opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), almost forswore
his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) charitable resolutions of the day before; but who again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
walked lonely at night round the square which was near to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hotel,
looking up at the bright moon with a full appreciation of the beauty
of the heavens, asked himself what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) should wish to
interfere with the happiness of two human beings much younger than
himself, and much fitter to enjoy the world. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had had a bath,
and had got rid of the dust, and had eaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) dinner.

<p/>The next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was in Welbeck Street at an early hour. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
knocked he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had not made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) mind whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would ask for Lady
Carbury or her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter, and did at last inquire whether <div class="bookquote">``the ladies''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>were at home. The ladies were reported as being at home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was
at once shown into the drawing-room, where Hetta was sitting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
hurried up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) at once took her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) arms and kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had never done such a thing before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had never even kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand. Though they were cousins and dear friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had never
treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) after that fashion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) instinct told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) immediately
that such a greeting from him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was a sign of affectionate compliance
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wishes. That this man should kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) best and
dearest relation, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) most trusted friend, as almost her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) brother,
was certainly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) no offence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could cling to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in fondest
love,--if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would only consent not to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) lover. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Roger, I am
so glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, escaping gently from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not write an answer, and so I came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not reproach me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--no. Why should I reproach you? You have committed no fault. I
should not have come had I intended to reproach any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it be as you wish it,--if it must. I have made up my mind to

her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) by the hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) shoulder and began to
weep. <div class="bookquote">``And still you will be all the world to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) continued, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) waist. <div class="bookquote">``As you will not be my wife, you shall be my

he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thus spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) tears were renewed. <div class="bookquote">``I have planned it all out in
my mind, dear. There! If there be anything that I can do to add to
your happiness, I will do it. You must believe this of me,--that to
make you happy shall be the only enjoyment of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It had been hardly possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as yet that the
man to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thus consenting to surrender her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not even
condescended to answer the letter in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to come
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). And now, sobbing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was, overcome by the tenderness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin's affection, anxious to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) intense gratitude,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not know how first to mention the name of Paul Montague.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--why should I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)? It is not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) sake that I am
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your husband shall certainly be my friend;--or, if not, the fault
shall not be mine. It shall all be forgotten, Hetta,--as nearly as
such things may be forgotten. But I had nothing to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) till
I had seen you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>At that moment the door was opened and Lady Carbury
entered the room, and, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) greeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin, looked
first at her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter and then at Roger. <div class="bookquote">``I have come up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``to signify my adhesion to this marriage.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury's face fell
very low. <div class="bookquote">``I need not speak again of what were my own wishes. I have
learned at last that it could not have been so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray, mamma--,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>Hetta began, but was unable to find words with
which to go on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) prayer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know that it need be so at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``I
think it is very much in your own hands. Of course it is not for me
to press such an arrangement, if it be not in accord with your own
wishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as engaged to marry Paul Montague,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; mamma,--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>cried Hetta boldly. <div class="bookquote">``It is so. I am engaged to
him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg to let your cousin know that it is not so with my
consent,--nor, as far as I can understand at present, with the
consent of Mr. Montague himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul Montague!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Roger Carbury. <div class="bookquote">``The consent of Paul
Montague! I think I may take upon myself to say that there can be no
doubt as to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There has been a quarrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has not quarrelled with you, Hetta?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has not answered me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta piteously.

<p/>Then Lady Carbury gave a full and somewhat coloured account of what
had taken place, while Roger listened with admirable patience. <div class="bookquote">``The
marriage is on every account objectionable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
means are precarious. His (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) conduct with regard to that woman has been
very bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has been sadly mixed up with that wretched man who
destroyed himself. And now, when Henrietta has written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) without
my sanction,--in opposition to my express commands,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) takes no
notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), very properly, sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) back a present that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has resented her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) doing so. I trust that his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
resentment may be continued.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetta was now seated on a sofa hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) face and weeping. Roger
stood perfectly still, listening with respectful silence till Lady
Carbury had spoken her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) last word. And even then he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was slow to
answer, considering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might best say. <div class="bookquote">``I think I had better see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``If, as I imagine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) has not received my cousin's
letter, that matter will be set at rest. We must not take advantage
of such an accident as that. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) income,--that I think may be
managed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) connection with Mr. Melmotte was unfortunate, but was
due to no fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not but remember
Lady Carbury's great anxiety to be closely connected with Melmotte,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was too generous to say a word on that head. <div class="bookquote">``I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),
Lady Carbury, and then I will come to you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Carbury did not dare to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) to
see Paul Montague. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) knew that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) really threw himself into
the scale against her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) opposition would weigh nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was
too powerful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) honesty and greatness of character,--and had
been too often admitted by herself to be the guardian angel of the
family,--for her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) to stand against him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) still thought that had
he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) persevered, Hetta would have become his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) wife.

<p/>It was late that evening before Roger found Paul Montague, who had
only then returned from Liverpool with Fisker,--whose subsequent
doings have been recorded somewhat out of their turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what letter you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). I wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) twice. My last letter was
one which I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ought to have answered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had accepted me,
and had given me a right to tell my own story when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) unfortunately
heard from other sources the story of my journey to Lowestoft with
Mrs. Hurtle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul pleaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) own case with indignant heat, not
understanding at first that Roger had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) on a friendly
mission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did answer your letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not had a line from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>);--not a word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did answer your letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) say to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,--you must ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) will not see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) will see you. I can tell you that. And I will tell you this
also;--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) wrote to you as a girl writes to the lover whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
does wish to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that true?''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Paul, jumping up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am here especially to tell you that it is true. I should hardly
come on such a mission if there were a doubt. You may go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), and
need have nothing to fear,--unless, indeed, it be the opposition of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is stronger than her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) is. And now I wish you to hear what I have to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul, sitting down suddenly. Up to this moment
Roger Carbury, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had certainly brought glad tidings, had
not communicated them as a joyous, sympathetic messenger. His (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) face
had been severe, and the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) voice almost harsh; and Paul,
remembering well the words of the last letter which his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) old friend
had written him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), did not expect personal kindness. Roger would
probably say very disagreeable things to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) must bear with
all the patience which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could summon to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) assistance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what my feelings have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>Roger began, <div class="bookquote">``and how deeply
I have resented what I thought to be an interference with my
affections. But no quarrel between you and me, whatever the rights of
it may be--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never quarrelled with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>Paul began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will listen to me for a moment it will be better. No anger
between you and me, let it arise as it might, should be allowed to
interfere with the happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) whom I suppose we both love
better than all the rest of the world put together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I;--and so I always shall. But she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is to be your wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
shall be my daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) shall have my property,--or her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) child shall
be my heir. My house shall be her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) house,--if you and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) will consent
to make it so. You will not be afraid of me. You know me, I think,
too well for that. You may now count on any assistance you could
have from me were I a father giving you a daughter in marriage. I do
this because I will make the happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) life the chief object
of mine. Now good night. Don't say anything about it at present.
By-and-by we shall be able to talk about these things with more
equable temper.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Having so spoken he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) hurried out of the room, leaving
Paul Montague bewildered by the tidings which had been announced to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XCIV.

<p/>JOHN CRUMB``S VICTORY.


<p/>In the meantime great preparations were going on down in Suffolk for
the marriage of that happiest of lovers, John Crumb. John Crumb had
been up to London, had been formally reconciled to Ruby,--who had
submitted to his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) floury embraces, not with the best grace in the
world, but still with a submission that had satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) future
husband,--had been intensely grateful to Mrs. Hurtle, and almost
munificent in liberality to Mrs. Pipkin, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presented a
purple silk dress, in addition to the cloak which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had given on a
former occasion. During this visit he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had expressed no anger against
Ruby, and no indignation in reference to the baronite. When informed
by Mrs. Pipkin, who hoped thereby to please him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), that Sir Felix
was supposed to be still <div class="bookquote">``all one mash of gore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) blandly smiled,
remarking that no man could be much the worse for a <div class="bookquote">``few sich taps
as them.''  (<font color='red'><b>no man</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) only stayed a few hours in London, but during these few
hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) settled everything. When Mrs. Pipkin suggested that Ruby
should be married from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) winked his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) declined
the suggestion with thanks. Daniel Ruggles was old, and, under the
influence of continued gin and water, was becoming feeble. John Crumb
was of opinion that the old man should not be neglected, and hinted
that with a little care the five hundred pounds which had originally
been promised as Ruby's fortune, might at any rate be secured. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
of opinion that the marriage should be celebrated in Suffolk,--the
feast being spread at Sheep's Acre farm, if Dan Ruggles could be
talked into giving it,--and if not, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) own house. When both the
ladies explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) that this last proposition was not in strict
accordance with the habits of the fashionable world, John expressed
an opinion that, under the peculiar circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) marriage,
the ordinary laws of the world might be suspended. <div class="bookquote">``It ain't jist
like other folks, after all as we've been through,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>),--meaning
probably to imply that having had to fight for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was
entitled to give a breakfast on the occasion if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) pleased. But
whether the banquet was to be given by the bride's grandfather or by
himself,--he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was determined that there should be a banquet, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would bid the guests. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) invited both Mrs. Pipkin and Mrs. Hurtle,
and at last succeeded in inducing Mrs. Hurtle to promise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
would bring Mrs. Pipkin down to Bungay, for the occasion.

<p/>Then it was necessary to fix the day, and for this purpose it was of
course essential that Ruby should be consulted. During the discussion
as to the feast and the bridegroom's entreaties that the two ladies
would be present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had taken no part in the matter in hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
was brought up to be kissed, and having been duly kissed she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) retired
again among the children, having only expressed one wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
own,--namely, that Joe Mixet might not have anything to do with
the affair. But the day could not be fixed without her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
was summoned. Crumb had been absurdly impatient, proposing next
Tuesday,--making his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) proposition on a Friday. They could cook enough
meat for all Bungay to eat by Tuesday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) was aware of no
other cause for delay. <div class="bookquote">``That's out of the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div>Ruby had said
decisively, and as the two elder ladies had supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) Mr. Crumb
yielded with a good grace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) did not himself appreciate the reasons
given because, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) remarked, gowns can be bought ready made at
any shop. But Mrs. Pipkin told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) with a laugh that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) didn't know
anything about it, and when the 14th of August was named he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) only
scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) head and, muttering something about Thetford fair,
agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) would, yet once again, allow love to take precedence
of business. If Tuesday would have suited the ladies as well he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) might have managed to combine the marriage and the
fair, but when Mrs. Pipkin told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) must not interfere any
further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) yielded with a good grace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) merely remained in London
long enough to pay a friendly visit to the policeman who had locked
him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) up, and then returned to Suffolk, revolving in his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) mind how
glorious should be the matrimonial triumph which he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had at last
achieved.

<p/>Before the day arrived, old Ruggles had been constrained to forgive
his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) granddaughter, and to give a general assent to the marriage. When
John Crumb, with a sound of many trumpets, informed all Bungay that
he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had returned victorious from London, and that after all the ups
and downs of his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) courtship Ruby was to become his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) wife on a fixed
day, all Bungay took his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) part, and joined in a general attack upon
Mr. Daniel Ruggles. The cross-grained old man held out for a long
time, alleging that the girl was no better than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should be, and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had run away with the baronite. But this assertion was
met by so strong a torrent of contradiction, that the farmer was
absolutely driven out of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) own convictions. It is to be feared that
many lies were told on Ruby's behalf by lips which had been quite
ready a fortnight since to take away her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) character. But it had become
an acknowledged fact in Bungay that John Crumb was ready at any hour
to punch the head of any man who should hint that Ruby Ruggles had,
at any period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) life, done any act or spoken any word unbecoming
a young lady; and so strong was the general belief in John Crumb,
that Ruby became the subject of general eulogy from all male lips
in the town. And though perhaps some slight suspicion of irregular
behaviour up in London might be whispered by the Bungay ladies among
themselves, still the feeling in favour of Mr. Crumb was so general,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) constancy was so popular, that the grandfather could not
stand against it. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why I ain't to do as I likes with my
own,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) said to Joe Mixet, the baker, who went out to Sheep's Acre
Farm as one of many deputations sent by the municipality of Bungay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)'s your own flesh and blood, Mr. Ruggles,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baker</b></font>)</div>said the baker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) ain't;--no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)'s a Pipkin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)'s taken up with
Mrs. Pipkin jist because I hate the Pipkinses. Let Mrs. Pipkin give
'em a breakfast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) is your own flesh and blood,--and your name, too, Mr. Ruggles.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)'s going to be the respectable wife of a respectable man, Mr.
Ruggles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't give 'em no breakfast;--that's flat,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had yielded in the main when he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) allowed himself to base his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
opposition on one immaterial detail. The breakfast was to be given at
the King's Head, and, though it was acknowledged on all sides that no
authority could be found for such a practice, it was known that the
bill was to be paid by the bridegroom. Nor would Mr. Ruggles pay the
five hundred pounds down as in early days he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had promised to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
was very clear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) mind that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) undertaking on that head was
altogether cancelled by Ruby's departure from Sheep's Acre. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
was reminded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) had nearly pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) granddaughter's hair out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) head, and had thus justified her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) act of rebellion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) did not
contradict the assertion, but implied that if Ruby did not choose to
earn her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) fortune on such terms as those, that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) fault. It was
not to be supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) was to give a girl, who was after all as
much a Pipkin as a Ruggles, five hundred pounds for nothing. But,
in return for that night's somewhat harsh treatment of Ruby, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) did
at last consent to have the money settled upon John Crumb at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
death,--an arrangement which both the lawyer and Joe Mixet thought to
be almost as good as a free gift, being both of them aware that the
consumption of gin and water was on the increase. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>), moreover,
was persuaded to receive Mrs. Pipkin and Ruby at the farm for the
night previous to the marriage. This very necessary arrangement was
made by Mr. Mixet's mother, a most respectable old lady, who went
out in a fly from the inn attired in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) best black silk gown and an
overpowering bonnet, an old lady from whom her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son had inherited his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
eloquence, who absolutely shamed the old man into compliance,--not,
however, till she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had promised to send out the tea and white sugar
and box of biscuits which were thought to be necessary for Mrs.
Pipkin on the evening preceding the marriage. A private sitting-room
at the inn was secured for the special accommodation of Mrs.
Hurtle,--who was supposed to be a lady of too high standing to be
properly entertained at Sheep's Acre Farm.

<p/>On the day preceding the wedding one trouble for a moment clouded
the bridegroom's brow. Ruby had demanded that Joe Mixet should not
be among the performers, and John Crumb, with the urbanity of a
lover, had assented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) demand,--as far, at least, as silence
can give consent. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) felt himself unable to answer such
interrogatories as the parson might put to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) without the assistance
of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) friend, although he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) devoted much study to the matter. <div class="bookquote">``You
could come in behind like, Joe, just as if I knew nothin' about it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>suggested Crumb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you say a word of me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) won't say nothing, you may be
sure. You ain't going to give in to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) cantraps that way, John?''
 (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>John shook his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) head and rubbed the meal about on his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``It
was only just something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) to say. What have I done that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
should object to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't ever go for to--kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>),--did you, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a one'er you are! That wouldn't 'a set her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) again me. It is just
because I stood up and spoke for you like a man that night at Sheep's
Acre, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) mind was turned the other way. Don't you notice
nothing about it. When we're all in the church she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) won't go back
because Joe Mixet's there. I'll bet you a gallon, old fellow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) and
I are the best friends in Bungay before six months are gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) must have a better friend than thee, Joe, or I
must know the reason why.''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>But John Crumb's heart was too big for
jealousy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) agreed at last that Joe Mixet should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) best
man, undertaking to <div class="bookquote">``square it all''  (<font color='red'><b>Mixet man</b></font>)</div>with Ruby, after the ceremony.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) met the ladies at the station and,--for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>),--was quite eloquent
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) welcome to Mrs. Hurtle and Mrs. Pipkin. To Ruby he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) said but
little. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) new hat, and generally bright in
subsidiary wedding garments, with great delight. <div class="bookquote">``Ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) bootiful
now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) said aloud to Mrs. Hurtle on the platform, to the great
delight of half Bungay, who had accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) on the occasion.
Ruby, hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) praises thus sung, made a fearful grimace as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>)
turned round to Mrs. Pipkin, and whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) aunt, so that those
only who were within a yard or two could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is such a
fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) conducted Mrs. Hurtle in an omnibus up to the Inn, and
afterwards himself drove Mrs. Pipkin and Ruby out to Sheep's Acre;
in the performance of all which duties he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) was dressed in the green
cutaway coat with brass buttons which had been expressly made for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>)
marriage. <div class="bookquote">``Thou`rt come back then, Ruby,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ain't going to trouble you long, grandfather,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So best;--so best. And this is Mrs. Pipkin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Ruggles; that's my name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard your name. I've heard your name, and I don't know as I
ever want to hear it again. But they say as you've been kind to that
girl as 'd 'a been on the town only for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandfather, that ain't true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby with energy. The old man
made no rejoinder, and Ruby was allowed to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) aunt up into the
bedroom which they were both to occupy. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mrs. Pipkin, just you
say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>pleaded Ruby, <div class="bookquote">``how was it possible for any girl to live with an
old man like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Ruby, you might always have gone to live with the young man
instead when you pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean John Crumb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I mean John Crumb, Ruby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't much to choose between 'em. What one says is all spite;
and the other man says nothing at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh Ruby, Ruby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin, with solemnly persuasive voice, <div class="bookquote">``I
hope you'll come to learn some day, that a loving heart is better nor
a fickle tongue,--specially with vittels certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div><p/>On the following morning the Bungay church bells rang merrily, and
half its population was present to see John Crumb made a happy man.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself went out to the farm and drove the bride and Mrs. Pipkin
into the town, expressing an opinion that no hired charioteer would
bring them so safely as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do himself; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) think it any
disgrace to be seen performing this task before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
smiled and nodded at every one, now and then pointing back with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
whip to Ruby when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met any of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) specially intimate friends, as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have said, <div class="bookquote">``See, I've got her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) at last in spite of all
difficulties.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Poor Ruby, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) misery under this treatment, would
have escaped out of the cart had it been possible. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was
altogether in the man's hands and no escape was within her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) reach.
<div class="bookquote">``What's the odds?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin as they settled their bonnets in
a room at the Inn just before they entered the church. <div class="bookquote">``Drat it,--you
make me that angry I'm half minded to cuff you. Ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fond o'
you? Ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got a house of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own? Ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) well to do all round?
Manners! What's manners? I don't see nothing amiss in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
means what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says, and I call that the best of good manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ruby</b></font>)</div><p/>Ruby, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) reached the church, had been too completely quelled
by outward circumstances to take any notice of Joe Mixet, who was
standing there, quite unabashed, with a splendid nosegay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>)
button-hole. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) certainly had no right on this occasion to complain
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) husband's silence. Whereas she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could hardly bring herself
to utter the responses in a voice loud enough for the clergyman
to catch the familiar words, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) assertions so vehemently
that they were heard throughout the whole building. <div class="bookquote">``I, John,--take
thee Ruby,--to my wedded wife,--to `ave and to `old,--from this day
forrard,--for better nor worser,--for richer nor poorer--;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and so
on to the end. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) came to the <div class="bookquote">``worldly goods''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
endowed his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) Ruby, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was very emphatic indeed. Since the day had been
fixed he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had employed all his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) leisure-hours in learning the words by
heart, and would now hardly allow the clergyman to say them before
him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) thoroughly enjoyed the ceremony, and would have liked to be
married over and over again, every day for a week, had it been
possible.

<p/>And then there came the breakfast, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) marshalled the way up
the broad stairs of the inn at Bungay, with Mrs. Hurtle on one arm
and Mrs. Pipkin on the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had been told that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) ought to take
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) wife's arm on this occasion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) meant to see
a good deal of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in future, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) opportunities of being
civil to Mrs. Hurtle and Mrs. Pipkin would be rare. Thus it came to
pass that, in spite of all that poor Ruby had said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was conducted
to the marriage-feast by Joe Mixet himself. Ruby, I think, had
forgotten the order which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had given in reference to the baker.
When desiring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) might see nothing more of Joe Mixet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had
been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) pride;--but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was so tamed and quelled by the
outward circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) position, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was glad to have some
one near her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) who knew how to behave himself. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Crumb, you have my
best wishes for your continued `ealth and `appiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe Mixet/Mixet/Joe</b></font>)</div>said Joe Mixet
in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very good of you to say so, Mr. Mixet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>)'s a good `un; is he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You just be fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) and stroke him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) down, and make much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>),
and I'm blessed if you mayn't do a`most anything with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>),--all's one
as a babby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man shouldn't be all's one as a babby, Mr. Mixet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) don't drink hard, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) works hard, and go where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) will he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>)
can hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) own.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>Ruby said no more, and soon found herself seated
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) husband's side. It certainly was wonderful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) that so many
people should pay John Crumb so much respect, and should seem to
think so little of the meal and flour which pervaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) countenance.

<p/>After the breakfast, or <div class="bookquote">``bit of dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>as John Crumb would call
it, Mr. Mixet of course made a speech. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) had had the pleasure of
knowing John Crumb for a great many years, and the honour of being
acquainted with Miss Ruby Ruggles,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) begged all their pardons,
and should have said Mrs. John Crumb,--ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) was a child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a downright story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby in a whisper to Mrs. Hurtle.
``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>)'d never known two young people more fitted by the gifts of
nature to contribute to one another's `appinesses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) had understood
that Mars and Wenus always lived on the best of terms, and perhaps
the present company would excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) likened this `appy young
couple to them two `eathen gods and goddesses. For Miss Ruby,--Mrs.
Crumb he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) should say,--was certainly lovely as ere a Wenus as ever
was; and as for John Crumb, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) didn't believe that ever a Mars among
'em could stand again him (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) didn't remember just at present whether
Mars and Wenus had any young family, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mixet</b></font>) hoped that before long
there would be any number of young Crumbs for the Bungay birds to
pick up. <div class="bookquote">``Appy is the man as `as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quiver full of 'em,--and the
woman too, if you'll allow me to say so, Mrs. Crumb.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The speech, of
which only a small sample can be given here, was very much admired by
the ladies and gentlemen present,--with the single exception of poor
Ruby, who would have run away and locked herself in an inner chamber
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) not been certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would be brought back again.


<p/>-LSB-Illustration: The happy bridegroom.-RSB-


<p/>In the afternoon John took his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) bride to Lowestoft, and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
back to all the glories of his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) own house on the following day. His (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>)
honeymoon was short, but its influence on Ruby was beneficent. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was alone with the man, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) husband, and
thinking something of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done to win her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did learn to respect him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now, Ruby, give a fellow a buss,--as
though you meant it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, when the first fitting occasion
presented itself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, John,--what nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't nonsense to me, I can tell you. I'd sooner have a kiss from
you than all the wine as ever was swallowed.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) did kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``as though she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) meant it;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) returned with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Bungay
the next day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) would endeavour to do
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) duty by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.




<p/>CHAPTER XCV.

<p/>THE LONGESTAFFE MARRIAGES.


<p/>In another part of Suffolk, not very far from Bungay, there was a
lady whose friends had not managed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) affairs as well as Ruby's
friends had done for Ruby. Miss Georgiana Longestaffe in the early
days of August was in a very miserable plight. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) sister's marriage
with Mr. George Whitstable was fixed for the first of September, a
day which in Suffolk is of all days the most sacred; and the combined
energies of the houses of Caversham and Toodlam were being devoted
to that happy event. Poor Georgey's position was in every respect
wretched, but its misery was infinitely increased by the triumph
of those hymeneals. It was but the other day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had looked
down from a very great height on her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) elder sister, and had utterly
despised the squire of Toodlam. And at that time, still so recent,
this contempt from her (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had been accepted as being almost reasonable.
Sophia had hardly ventured to rebel against it, and Mr. Whitstable
himself had been always afraid to encounter the shafts of irony with
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) fashionable future sister-in-law attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>). But all that
was now changed. Sophia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) pride of place had become a tyrant,
and George Whitstable, petted in the house with those sweetmeats
which are always showered on embryo bridegrooms, absolutely gave
himself airs. At this time Mr. Longestaffe was never at home. Having
assured himself that there was no longer any danger of the Brehgert
alliance he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had remained in London, thinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) presence to be
necessary for the winding up of Melmotte's affairs, and leaving
poor Lady Pomona to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) daughter's ill-humour. The family at
Caversham consisted therefore of the three ladies, and was enlivened
by daily visits from Toodlam. It will be owned that in this state of
things there was very little consolation for Georgiana.

<p/>It was not long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) quarrelled altogether with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister,--to
the point of absolutely refusing to act as bridesmaid. The reader may
remember that there had been a watch and chain, and that two of the
ladies of the family had expressed an opinion that these trinkets
should be returned to Mr. Brehgert who had bestowed them. But
Georgiana had not sent them back when a week had elapsed since the
receipt of Mr. Brehgert's last letter. The matter had perhaps escaped
Lady Pomona's memory, but Sophia was happily alive to the honour
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) family. <div class="bookquote">``Georgey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said one morning in their mother's
presence, <div class="bookquote">``don't you think Mr. Brehgert's watch ought to go back to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) without any more delay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you got to do with anybody's watch? The watch wasn't given
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it ought to go back. When papa finds that it has been kept
I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll be very angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no business of yours whether he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s angry or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it isn't sent George will tell Dolly. You know what would happen
then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was unbearable! That George Whitstable should interfere in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)
affairs,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) should talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) watch and chain. <div class="bookquote">``I never
will speak to George Whitstable again the longest day that ever I
live,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said, getting up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, don't say anything so horrible as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the
unhappy mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do say it. What has George Whitstable to do with me? A miserably
stupid fellow! Because you've landed him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>), you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>)'s to ride over
the whole family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Mr. Brehgert ought to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) watch and chain back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophia/Sophia Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said
Sophia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona. <div class="bookquote">``Georgiana, it must be sent
back. It really must,--or I shall tell your papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Miss Longestaffe/Georgiana Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/>Subsequently, on the same day, Georgiana brought the watch and chain
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother, protesting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had never thought of keeping them,
and explaining that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had intended to hand them over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) papa
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should have returned to Caversham. Lady Pomona was now
empowered to return them, and they were absolutely confided to the
hands of the odious George Whitstable, who about this time made a
journey to London in reference to certain garments which he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) required.
But Georgiana, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was so far beaten, kept up her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) quarrel with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) would not be bridesmaid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) would never speak to
George Whitstable. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) would shut herself up on the day of the
marriage.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) did think herself to be very hardly used. What was there left in
the world that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could do in furtherance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) future cause? And
what did her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father and mother expect would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)? Marriage
had ever been so clearly placed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) eyes as a condition of
things to be achieved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) own efforts, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could not endure
the idea of remaining tranquil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) father's house and waiting
till some fitting suitor might find her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had struggled and
struggled,--struggling still in vain,--till every effort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mind,
every thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) daily life, was pervaded by a conviction that
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) grew older from year to year, the struggle should be more
intense. The swimmer when first he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) finds himself in the water,
conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) skill and confident in his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) strength, can make his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)
way through the water with the full command of all his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) powers. But
when he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) begins to feel that the shore is receding from him (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>), that his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)
strength is going, that the footing for which he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) pants is still
far beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) feet,--that there is peril where before he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) had
contemplated no danger,--then he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) begins to beat the water with
strokes rapid but impotent, and to waste in anxious gaspings the
breath on which his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) very life must depend. So it was with poor
Georgey Longestaffe. Something must be done at once, or it would be
of no avail. Twelve years had been passed by her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) since first she (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>)
plunged into the stream,--the twelve years of her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) youth,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) was
as far as ever from the bank; nay, farther, if she (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) eyes.
She (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) too must strike out with rapid efforts, unless, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) would
abandon herself and let the waters close over her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) head. But immersed
as she (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) was here at Caversham, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) strike at all? Even now
the waters were closing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>). The sound of them was in her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) ears.
The ripple of the wave was already round her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) lips; robbing her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) of
breath. Ah!--might not there be some last great convulsive effort
which might dash her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) on shore, even if it were upon a rock!

<p/>That ultimate failure in her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) matrimonial projects would be the same
as drowning she (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) never for a moment doubted. It had never occurred
to her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) to consider with equanimity the prospect of living as an old
maid. It was beyond the scope of her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) mind to contemplate the chances
of a life in which marriage might be well if it came, but in which
unmarried tranquillity might also be well should that be her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) lot. Nor
could she (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) understand that others should contemplate it for her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>). No
doubt the battle had been carried on for many years so much under the
auspices of her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) father and mother as to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) in thinking that
their theory of life was the same as her (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) own. Lady Pomona had been
very open in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) teaching, and Mr. Longestaffe had always given a
silent adherence to the idea that the house in London was to be
kept open in order that husbands might be caught. And now when they
deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) real difficulty,--when they first told her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
to live at Caversham all the summer, and then sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) up to the
Melmottes, and after that forbade her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) marriage with Mr. Brehgert,--it
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) that they were unnatural parents who gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) a stone
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) wanted bread, a serpent when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) asked for a fish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) had
no friend left. There was no one living who seemed to care whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) had a husband or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) took to walking in solitude about the
park, and thought of many things with a grim earnestness which had
not hitherto belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) said one morning when all the care of the household
was being devoted to the future comforts,--chiefly in regard to
linen,--of Mrs. George Whitstable, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether papa has any
intention at all about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. George Whitstable</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what sort of way, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In any way. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) mean me to live here for ever and ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) intends to have a house in town again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm to be buried just like a nun in a convent,--only that the
nun does it by her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) own consent and I don't! Mamma, I won't stand it.
I won't indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, my dear, that that is nonsense. You see company here, just
as other people do in the country;--and as for not standing it, I
don't know what you mean. As long as you are one of your papa's
family of course you must live where he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, to hear you talk like that!--It is horrible--horrible!
As if you didn't know! As if you couldn't understand! Sometimes I
almost doubt whether papa does know, and then I think that if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would not be so cruel. But you understand it all as well as I do
myself. What is to become of me? Is it not enough to drive me mad
to be going about here by myself, without any prospect of anything?
Should you have liked at my age to have felt that you had no chance
of having a house of your own to live in? Why didn't you, among you,
let me marry Mr. Brehgert?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) said this she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) was almost eloquent
with passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona, <div class="bookquote">``that your papa wouldn't hear
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that if you would have helped me I would have done it in
spite of papa. What right has he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to domineer over me in that way? Why
shouldn't I have married the man if I chose? I am old enough to know
surely. You talk now of shutting up girls in convents as being a
thing quite impossible. This is much worse. Papa won't do anything to
help me. Why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) let me do something for myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't regret Mr. Brehgert!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't I regret him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)? I do regret him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>). I'd have him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) to-morrow if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) came. Bad as it might be, it couldn't be so bad as Caversham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>), Georgiana.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>)! Who thinks about love nowadays? I don't know any one who
loves any one else. You won't tell me that Sophy is going to marry
that idiot because she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>)! Did Julia Triplex love that man
with the large fortune? When you wanted Dolly to marry Marie Melmotte
you never thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>). I had got the better of all that
kind of thing before I was twenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think a young woman should love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me sick, mamma, to hear you talk in that way. It does
indeed. When one has been going on for a dozen years trying to do
something,--and I have never had any secrets from you,--then that you

help me I think I could still manage with Mr. Brehgert.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>Lady Pomona
shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``You have not got to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too horrid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would have to put up with it? Not you, or papa, or Dolly. I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will stand to me, mamma, I am sure it may be done. I would

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Georgiana, I will never see him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is a Jew!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What abominable prejudice;--what wicked prejudice! As if you didn't
know that all that is changed now! What possible difference can it
make about a man's religion? Of course I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is vulgar, and
old, and has a lot of children. But if I can put up with that, I
don't think that you and papa have a right to interfere. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
religion it cannot signify.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Georgiana, you make me very unhappy. I am wretched to see you so
discontented. If I could do anything for you, I would. But I will not
meddle about Mr. Brehgert. I shouldn't dare to do so. I don't think
you know how angry your papa can be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to let papa be a bugbear to frighten me. What can he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
do? I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll beat me. And I'd rather he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would than shut
me up here. As for you, mamma, I don't think you care for me a bit.
Because Sophy is going to be married to that oaf, you are become so
proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that you haven't half a thought for anybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very unjust, Georgiana.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what's unjust,--and I know who's ill-treated. I tell you
fairly, mamma, that I shall write to Mr. Brehgert and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) that

of papa. I don't mean to be afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) any more, and you may tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brehgert</b></font>) just what I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div><p/>All this made Lady Pomona very miserable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) did not communicate her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
daughter's threat to Mr. Longestaffe, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) did discuss it with
Sophia. Sophia was of opinion that Georgiana did not mean it, and
gave two or three reasons for thinking so. In the first place had she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
intended it she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) would have written her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) letter without saying a word
about it to Lady Pomona. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) certainly would not have declared
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) purpose of writing such letter after Lady Pomona had refused her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
assistance. And moreover,--Lady Pomona had received no former hint of
the information which was now conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>),--Georgiana was in the
habit of meeting the curate of the next parish almost every day in
the park.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Batherbolt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Pomona.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) is walking with Mr. Batherbolt almost every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>) is so very strict.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>)'s five years younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>)'s got nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>)
curacy! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>)'s a celibate! I heard the bishop laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>)
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>) called himself a celibate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't signify, mamma. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) is with him (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>) constantly. Wilson
has seen them,--and I know it. Perhaps papa could get him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) a living.
Dolly has a living of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) own that came to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly would be sure to sell the presentation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Pomona</b></font>)</div>said Lady Pomona.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the bishop would do something,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>said the anxious sister,
<div class="bookquote">``when he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) found that the man wasn't a celibate. Anything, mamma, would
be better than the Jew.''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>To this latter proposition Lady Pomona
gave a cordial assent. <div class="bookquote">``Of course it is a come-down to marry a
curate,--but a clergyman is always considered to be decent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Batherbolt</b></font>)</div><p/>The preparations for the Whitstable marriage went on without any
apparent attention to the intimacy which was growing up between Mr.
Batherbolt and Georgiana. There was no room to apprehend anything
wrong on that side. Mr. Batherbolt was so excellent a young man,
and so exclusively given to religion, that, even should Sophy's
suspicion be correct, he (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>) might be trusted to walk about the park with
Georgiana. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>) at any time come forward and ask to be allowed
to make the lady his (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>) wife, there would be no disgrace in the matter.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>) was a clergyman and a gentleman,--and the poverty would be
Georgiana's own affair.

<p/>Mr. Longestaffe returned home only on the eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) eldest
daughter's marriage, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) came Dolly. Great trouble had been
taken to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) that duty absolutely required his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) presence at his (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>)
sister's marriage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Longestaffe</b></font>) had at last consented to be there. It is
not generally considered a hardship by a young man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
have to go into a good partridge country on the 1st of September, and
Dolly was an acknowledged sportsman. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) considered that
he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) had made a great sacrifice to his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) family, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) was received by
Lady Pomona as though he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) were a bright example to other sons. He (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>)
found the house not in a very comfortable position, for Georgiana
still persisted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) refusal either to be a bridesmaid or to speak
to Mr. Whitstable; but still his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) presence, which was very rare at
Caversham, gave some assistance: and, as at this moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) money
affairs had been comfortably arranged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) was not called upon to
squabble with his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitstable</b></font>) father. It was a great thing that one of the girls
should be married, and Dolly had brought down an enormous china dog,
about five feet high, as a wedding present, which added materially
to the happiness of the meeting. Lady Pomona had determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>)
would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) husband of those walks in the park, and of other signs
of growing intimacy which had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) ears;--but this she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomona</b></font>) would
postpone until after the Whitstable marriage.

<p/>But at nine o'clock on the morning set apart for that marriage, they
were all astounded by the news that Georgiana had run away with Mr.
Batherbolt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had been up before six. He (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>) had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) at the park
gate, and had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) over to catch the early train at Stowmarket.
Then it appeared, too, that by degrees various articles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
property had been conveyed to Mr. Batherbolt's lodgings in the
adjacent village, so that Lady Pomona's fear that Georgiana would not
have a thing to wear, was needless. When the fact was first known
it was almost felt, in the consternation of the moment, that the
Whitstable marriage must be postponed. But Sophia had a word to say
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) mother on that head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said it. The marriage was not
postponed. At first Dolly talked of going after his (<font color='blue'><b>Batherbolt</b></font>) younger sister,
and the father did dispatch various telegrams. But the fugitives
could not be brought back, and with some little delay,--which made
the marriage perhaps uncanonical but not illegal,--Mr. George
Whitstable was made a happy man.

<p/>It need only be added that in about a month's time Georgiana returned
to Caversham as Mrs. Batherbolt, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) resided there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
husband in much connubial bliss for the next six months. At the end
of that time they removed to a small living, for the purchase of
which Mr. Longestaffe had managed to raise the necessary money.




<p/>CHAPTER XCVI.

<p/>WHERE <div class="bookquote">``THE WILD ASSES QUENCH THEIR THIRST.''


 (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div><p/>We must now go back a little in our story,--about three weeks,--in
order that the reader may be told how affairs were progressing at the
Beargarden. That establishment had received a terrible blow in the
defection of Herr Vossner. It was not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) had robbed the
club, and robbed every member of the club who had ventured to have
personal dealings with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>). Although a bad feeling in regard to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) was no doubt engendered in the minds of those who had suffered
deeply, it was not that alone which cast an almost funereal gloom
over the club. The sorrow was in this,--that with Herr Vossner all
their comforts had gone. Of course Herr Vossner had been a thief.
That no doubt had been known to them from the beginning. A man does
not consent to be called out of bed at all hours in the morning to
arrange the gambling accounts of young gentlemen without being a
thief. No one concerned with Herr Vossner had supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) to be an
honest man. But then as a thief he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) had been so comfortable that his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)
absence was regretted with a tenderness almost amounting to love even
by those who had suffered most severely from his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) rapacity. Dolly
Longestaffe had been robbed more outrageously than any other member
of the club, and yet Dolly Longestaffe had said since the departure
of the purveyor that London was not worth living in now that Herr
Vossner was gone. In a week the Beargarden collapsed,--as Germany
would collapse for a period if Herr Vossner's great compatriot were
suddenly to remove himself from the scene; but as Germany would
strive to live even without Bismarck, so did the club make its new
efforts. But here the parallel must cease. Germany no doubt would
at last succeed, but the Beargarden had received a blow from which
it seemed that there was no recovery. At first it was proposed that
three men should be appointed as trustees,--trustees for paying
Vossner's debts, trustees for borrowing more money, trustees for the
satisfaction of the landlord who was beginning to be anxious as to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) future rent. At a certain very triumphant general meeting of
the club it was determined that such a plan should be arranged, and
the members assembled were unanimous. It was at first thought that
there might be a little jealousy as to the trusteeship. The club was
so popular and the authority conveyed by the position would be so
great, that A, B, and C might feel aggrieved at seeing so much power
conferred on D, E, and F. When at the meeting above mentioned one or
two names were suggested, the final choice was postponed, as a matter
of detail to be arranged privately, rather from this consideration
than with any idea that there might be a difficulty in finding
adequate persons. But even the leading members of the Beargarden
hesitated when the proposition was submitted to them with all its
honours and all its responsibilities. Lord Nidderdale declared from
the beginning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) would have nothing to do with it,--pleading his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
poverty openly. Beauchamp Beauclerk was of opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Beauclerk</b></font>) himself
did not frequent the club often enough. Mr. Lupton professed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupton</b></font>)
inability as a man of business. Lord Grasslough pleaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) father.
The club from the first had been sure of Dolly Longestaffe's
services;--for were not Dolly's pecuniary affairs now in process of
satisfactory arrangement, and was it not known by all men that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
courage never failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) in regard to money? But even he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) declined.
<div class="bookquote">``I have spoken to Squercum,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) said to the Committee, <div class="bookquote">``and Squercum
won't hear of it. Squercum has made inquiries and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) thinks the
club very shaky.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When one of the Committee made a remark as to
Mr. Squercum which was not complimentary,--insinuated indeed that
Squercum without injustice might be consigned to the infernal
deities,--Dolly took the matter up warmly. <div class="bookquote">``That's all very well for
you, Grasslough; but if you knew the comfort of having a fellow who
could keep you straight without preaching sermons at you you wouldn't
despise Squercum. I've tried to go alone and I find that does not
answer. Squercum's my coach, and I mean to stick pretty close to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the trustees</b></font>)</div>Then it came to pass that the triumphant project as to the
trustees fell to the ground, although Squercum himself advised
that the difficulty might be lessened if three gentlemen could be
selected who lived well before the world and yet had nothing to lose.
Whereupon Dolly suggested Miles Grendall. But the Committee shook its
heads, not thinking it possible that the club could be re-established
on a basis of three Miles Grendalls.

<p/>Then dreadful rumours were heard. The Beargarden must surely be
abandoned. <div class="bookquote">``It is such a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale, <div class="bookquote">``because there never
has been anything like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Smoke all over the house!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No horrid nonsense about closing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Grasslough, <div class="bookquote">``and no infernal
old fogies wearing out the carpets and paying for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a vestige of propriety, or any beastly rules to be kept! That's
what I liked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an old story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lupton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lupton, <div class="bookquote">``that if you put a man into
Paradise he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll make it too hot to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). That's what you've done
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lupton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What we ought to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, who was pervaded by a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupton</b></font>)
own good fortune in regard to Squercum, <div class="bookquote">``is to get some fellow like
Vossner, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) tell us how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) wants to steal above his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>)
regular pay. Then we could subscribe that among us. I really think
that might be done. Squercum would find a fellow, no doubt.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>But Mr.
Lupton was of opinion that the new Vossner might perhaps not know,
when thus consulted, the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lupton</b></font>) own cupidity.

<p/>One day, before the Whitstable marriage, when it was understood that
the club would actually be closed on the 12th August unless some
new heaven-inspired idea might be forthcoming for its salvation,
Nidderdale, Grasslough, and Dolly were hanging about the hall and
the steps, and drinking sherry and bitters preparatory to dinner,
when Sir Felix Carbury came round the neighbouring corner and, in a
creeping, hesitating fashion, entered the hall door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had nearly
recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) wounds, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) still wore a bit of court
plaster on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) upper lip, and had not yet learned to look or to speak
as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had not had two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) front teeth knocked out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had
heard little or nothing of what had been done at the Beargarden since
Vossner's defection. It was now a month since he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) had been seen at
the club. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) thrashing had been the wonder of perhaps half nine
days, but latterly his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) existence had been almost forgotten. Now, with
difficulty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) had summoned courage to go down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) old haunt, so
completely had he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) been cowed by the latter circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) life;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) had determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) would pluck up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) courage, and talk to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) old associates as though no evil thing had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) had
still money enough to pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) dinner and to begin a small rubber
of whist. If fortune should go against him (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>) might glide into I. O.
U.``s;--as others had done before, so much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squercum</b></font>) cost. <div class="bookquote">``By George,
here's Carbury!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. Lord Grasslough whistled, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>)
back, and walked up-stairs; but Nidderdale and Dolly consented to
have their hands shaken by the stranger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thought you were out of town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't seen you
for the last ever so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been out of town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Felix,--lying; <div class="bookquote">``down in Suffolk. But
I'm back now. How are things going on here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're not going at all;--they're gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything is smashed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``We shall all have to pay,
I don't know how much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't Vossner ever caught?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>asked the baronet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Caught!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``No;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has caught us. I don't know
that there has ever been much idea of catching Vossner. We close
altogether next Monday, and the furniture is to be gone to law for.
Flatfleece says it belongs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) under what he (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) calls a deed of sale.
Indeed, everything that everybody has seems to belong to Flatfleece.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>)'s always in and out of the club, and has got the key of the
cellar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That don't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale, <div class="bookquote">``as Vossner took care that
there shouldn't be any wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vossner</b></font>)'s got most of the forks and spoons, and only lets us use what we
have as a favour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose one can get a dinner here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; to-day you can, and perhaps to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't there any playing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Felix with dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't seen a card this fortnight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``There hasn't
been anybody to play. Everything has gone to the dogs. There has been
the affair of Melmotte, you know;--though, I suppose, you do know all
about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) poisoned himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course that had effect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, continuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) history.
<div class="bookquote">``Though why fellows shouldn't play cards because another fellow like
that takes poison, I can't understand. Last year the only day I
managed to get down in February, the hounds didn't come because some
old cove had died. What harm could our hunting have done him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? I call
that rot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Melmotte's death was rather awful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not half so awful as having nothing to amuse one. And now they say
the girl is going to be married to Fisker. I don't know how you and
Nidderdale like that. I never went in for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) myself. Squercum never
seemed to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s welcome for me, and I dare say
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) couldn't do better with herself. I was very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>);--I'll be
shot if I wasn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Carbury too, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I wasn't. If I'd really been fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) I suppose it would have
come off. I should have had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) safe enough to America, if I'd cared
about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>This was Sir Felix's view of the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come into the smoking-room, Dolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale. <div class="bookquote">``I can stand
most things, and I try to stand everything; but, by George, that
fellow is such a cad that I cannot stand him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). You and I are bad
enough,--but I don't think we're so heartless as Carbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I'm heartless at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm good-natured
to everybody that is good-natured to me,--and to a great many people
who ain't. I'm going all the way down to Caversham next week to see
my sister married, though I hate the place and hate marriages, and
if I was to be hung for it I couldn't say a word to the fellow who
is going to be my brother-in-law. But I do agree about Carbury. It's
very hard to be good-natured to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>But, in the teeth of these adverse opinions Sir Felix managed to get
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) dinner-table close to theirs and to tell them at dinner something
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) future prospects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) was going to travel and see the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>)
had, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) own account, completely run through London life
and found that it was all barren.

<p/>``In life I've rung all changes through,
Run every pleasure down,
<div class="bookquote">``Midst each excess of folly too,
And lived with half the town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Felix did not exactly quote the old song, probably having never
heard the words. But that was the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) present story. It was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) determination to seek new scenes, and in search of them to travel
over the greater part of the known world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How jolly for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a change, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No end of a change. Is any one going with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--yes. I've got a travelling companion;--a very pleasant
fellow, who knows a lot, and will be able to coach me up in things.
There's a deal to be learned by going abroad, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sort of a tutor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A parson, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) is a clergyman. Who told you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only my inventive genius. Well;--yes; I should say that would
be nice,--travelling about Europe with a clergyman. I shouldn't get
enough advantage out of it to make it pay, but I fancy it will just
suit you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an expensive sort of thing;--isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>asked Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--it does cost something. But I've got so sick of this kind of
life;--and then that railway Board coming to an end, and the club
smashing up, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marie Melmotte marrying Fisker,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>suggested Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That too, if you will. But I want a change, and a change I mean to
have. I've seen this side of things, and now I'll have a look at the
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you have a row in the street with some one the other day?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>This question was asked very abruptly by Lord Grasslough, who, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was sitting near them, had not yet joined in the conversation, and
who had not before addressed a word to Sir Felix. <div class="bookquote">``We heard something
about it, but we never got the right story.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>Nidderdale glanced
across the table at Dolly, and Dolly whistled. Grasslough looked at
the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) addressed as one does look when one expects an answer. Mr.
Lupton, with whom Grasslough was dining, also sat expectant. Dolly
and Nidderdale were both silent.

<p/>It was the fear of this that had kept Sir Felix away from the club.
Grasslough, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) had told himself, was just the fellow to ask such
a question,--ill-natured, insolent, and obtrusive. But the question
demanded an answer of some kind. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``a fellow attacked
me in the street, coming behind me when I had a girl with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
didn't get much the best of it though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh;--didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Grasslough. <div class="bookquote">``I think, upon the whole, you
know, you're right about going abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What business is it of yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>asked the baronet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well;--as the club is being broken up, I don't know that it is very
much the business of any of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was speaking to my friends, Lord Nidderdale and Mr. Longestaffe,
and not to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite appreciate the advantage of the distinction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Lord
Grasslough, <div class="bookquote">``and am sorry for Lord Nidderdale and Mr. Longestaffe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) chair.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) present opponent was not horrible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) as had been John Crumb,
as men in clubs do not now often knock each others' heads or draw
swords one upon another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let's have a quarrel here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lupton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lupton. <div class="bookquote">``I shall leave
the room if you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we must break up, let us break up in peace and quietness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said
Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if there is to be a fight, I'm good to go out with
anybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``When there's any beastly thing to be done,
I've always got to do it. But don't you think that kind of thing is
a little slow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who began it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, sitting down again. Whereupon Lord
Grasslough, who had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) dinner, walked out of the room.
<div class="bookquote">``That fellow is always wanting to quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one comfort, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``It wants two men to
make a quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix, taking this as a friendly
observation; <div class="bookquote">``and I'm not going to be fool enough to be one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I meant it fast enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Grasslough afterwards up
in the card-room. The other men who had been together had quickly
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>), leaving Sir Felix alone, and they had collected
themselves there not with the hope of play, but thinking that they
would be less interrupted than in the smoking-room. <div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose
we shall ever any of us be here again, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did come in I
thought I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the use of taking such a lot of trouble?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s a bad fellow. Most fellows are bad fellows in one way or
another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s bad all round,''  (<font color='red'><b>the enemy</b></font>)</div>said the bitter enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so this is to be the end of the Beargarden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Lord
Nidderdale with a peculiar melancholy. <div class="bookquote">``Dear old place! I always felt
it was too good to last. I fancy it doesn't do to make things too
easy;--one has to pay so uncommon dear for them! And then, you know,
when you've got things easy, then they get rowdy;--and, by George,
before you know where you are, you find yourself among a lot of
blackguards. If one wants to keep one's self straight, one has to
work hard at it, one way or the other. I suppose it all comes from
the fall of Adam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Solomon, Solon, and the Archbishop of Canterbury were rolled into
one, they couldn't have spoken with more wisdom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lupton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lupton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Live and learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>continued the young lord. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think anybody
has liked the Beargarden so much as I have, but I shall never try
this kind of thing again. I shall begin reading blue books to-morrow,
and shall dine at the Carlton. Next session I shan't miss a day in
the House, and I'll bet anybody a fiver that I make a speech before
Easter. I shall take to claret at 20_s._ a dozen, and shall go about
London on the top of an omnibus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How about getting married?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>asked Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh;--that must be as it comes. That's the governor's affair. None of
you fellows will believe me, but, upon my word, I liked that girl;
and I'd 've stuck to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at last,--only that there are some things a
fellow can't do. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was such a thundering scoundrel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/>After a while Sir Felix followed them up-stairs, and entered the room
as though nothing unpleasant had happened below. <div class="bookquote">``We can make up a
rubber;--can't we?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lupton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Nidderdale/Nidderdale/LORD NIDDERDALE</b></font>)</div>said Nidderdale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lupton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lupton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't a pack of cards in the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly. Lord
Grasslough didn't condescend to say a word. Sir Felix sat down with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) mouth, and the others continued to smoke in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what has become of Miles Grendall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>asked Sir Felix. But no
one made any answer, and they smoked on in silence. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) hasn't paid
me a shilling yet of the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) owes me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Still there was not a
word. <div class="bookquote">``And I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) ever will.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was another pause.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) is the biggest scoundrel I ever met,''  (<font color='red'><b>Felix/Felix Carbury/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Sir Felix.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know one as big,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div>said Lord Grasslough,--<div class="bookquote">``or, at any rate, as
little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grasslough/Lord Grasslough</b></font>)</div><p/>There was another pause of a minute, and then Sir Felix left the room
muttering something as to the stupidity of having no cards;--and
so brought to an end his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) connection with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) associates of the
Beargarden. From that time forth he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) was never more seen by them,--or,
if seen, was never known.

<p/>The other men remained there till well on into the night, although
there was not the excitement of any special amusement to attract
them. It was felt by them all that this was the end of the
Beargarden, and, with a melancholy seriousness befitting the
occasion, they whispered sad things in low voices, consoling
themselves simply with tobacco. <div class="bookquote">``I never felt so much like crying in
my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly/Dolly Longestaffe/Longestaffe</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grasslough</b></font>) asked for a glass of brandy-and-water at
about midnight. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, old fellows; good-bye. I'm going down to
Caversham, and I shouldn't wonder if I didn't drown myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Flatfleece/Flatfleece</b></font>)</div><p/>How Mr. Flatfleece went to law, and tried to sell the furniture, and
threatened everybody, and at last singled out poor Dolly Longestaffe
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) special victim; and how Dolly Longestaffe, by the aid of
Mr. Squercum, utterly confounded Mr. Flatfleece, and brought that
ingenious but unfortunate man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Flatfleece</b></font>) wife and small family, to
absolute ruin, the reader will hardly expect to have told to him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) in
detail in this chronicle.




<p/>CHAPTER XCVII.

<p/>MRS. HURTLE``S FATE.


<p/>Mrs. Hurtle had consented at the joint request of Mrs. Pipkin and
John Crumb to postpone her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) journey to New York and to go down to
Bungay and grace the marriage of Ruby Ruggles, not so much from any
love for the persons concerned, not so much even from any desire to
witness a phase of English life, as from an irresistible tenderness
towards Paul Montague. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) not only longed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) once again, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) could with difficulty bring herself to leave the land in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was living. There was no hope for her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was sure of that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
had consented to relinquish him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had condoned his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) treachery to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>),--and for his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) sake had even been kind to the rival who had taken
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) place. But still she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) lingered near him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>). And then, though, in all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) very restricted intercourse with such English people as she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) met,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) never ceased to ridicule things English, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) dreaded a return
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) own country. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) heart of hearts she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) liked the somewhat
stupid tranquillity of the life she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) saw, comparing it with the
rough tempests of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) past days. Mrs. Pipkin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) thought, was less
intellectual than any American woman she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had ever known; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) was
quite sure that no human being so heavy, so slow, and so incapable
of two concurrent ideas as John Crumb had ever been produced in the
United States;--but, nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) liked Mrs. Pipkin, and almost
loved John Crumb. How different would her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) life have been could she (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>)
have met a man who would have been as true to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crumb</b></font>) as John Crumb was
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Ruby!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) loved Paul Montague with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) despised herself
for loving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). How weak he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was;--how inefficient; how unable to
seize glorious opportunities; how swathed and swaddled by scruples
and prejudices;--how unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own countrymen in quickness of
apprehension and readiness of action! But yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
very faults, telling herself that there was something sweeter in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
English manners than in all the smart intelligence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) own land.
The man had been false to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>),--false as hell; had sworn to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) and
had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) oath; had ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) whole life; had made everything
blank before her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treachery! But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) also had not been
quite true with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had not at first meant to deceive;--nor had
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). They had played a game against each other; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with all the
inferiority of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intellect to weigh him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down, had won,--because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was a man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had much time for thinking, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) thought much about
these things. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could change his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleased, and be
as good a lover at the end as ever;--whereas she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was ruined by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
defection. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could look about for a fresh flower and boldly seek
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honey; whereas she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) could only sit and mourn for the sweets of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) had been rifled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) was not quite sure that such mourning
would not be more bitter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) in California than in Mrs. Pipkin's
solitary lodgings at Islington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Mr. Montague's partner,--was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Pipkin a
day or two after their return from the Crumb marriage. For Mr. Fisker
had called on Mrs. Hurtle, and Mrs. Hurtle had told Mrs. Pipkin so
much. <div class="bookquote">``To my thinking now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a nicer man than Mr. Montague.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Pipkin perhaps thought that as her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) lodger had lost one partner she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
might be anxious to secure the other;--perhaps felt, too, that it
might be well to praise an American at the expense of an Englishman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no accounting for tastes, Mrs. Pipkin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's true, too, Mrs. Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Montague is a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always did say that of him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), Mrs. Hurtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Fisker is--an American citizen.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Hurtle when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said
this was very far gone in tenderness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pipkin, who did not in the least understand
the meaning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) friend's last remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fisker came to me with tidings from San Francisco which I had
not heard before, and has offered to take me back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Pipkin's apron was immediately at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I must go some day, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you must. I couldn't hope as you'd stay here always.
I wish I could. I never shall forget the comfort it's been.
There hasn't been a week without everything settled; and most
ladylike,--most ladylike! You seem to me, Mrs. Hurtle, just as though
you had the bank in your pocket.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>All this the poor woman said, moved
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) sorrow to speak the absolute truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fisker isn't in any way a special friend of mine. But I hear
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) will be taking other ladies with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>), and I fancy I might as
well join the party. It will be less dull for me, and I shall prefer
company just at present for many reasons. We shall start on the first
of September.''  (<font color='red'><b>some remnant</b></font>)</div>As this was said about the middle of August there
was still some remnant of comfort for poor Mrs. Pipkin. A fortnight
gained was something; and as Mr. Fisker had come to England on
business, and as business is always uncertain, there might possibly
be further delay. Then Mrs. Hurtle made a further communication to
Mrs. Pipkin, which, though not spoken till the latter lady had her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
hand on the door, was, perhaps, the one thing which Mrs. Hurtle had
desired to say. <div class="bookquote">``By-the-bye, Mrs. Pipkin, I expect Mr. Montague to
call to-morrow at eleven. Just show him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) comes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
feared that unless some such instructions were given, there might be
a little scene at the door when the gentleman came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Montague;--oh! Of course, Mrs. Hurtle,--of course. I'll see to
it myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pipkin/Pipkin</b></font>)</div>Then Mrs. Pipkin went away abashed,--feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) had
made a great mistake in preferring any other man to Mr. Montague, if,
after all, recent difficulties were to be adjusted.

<p/>On the following morning Mrs. Hurtle dressed herself with almost more
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) usual simplicity, but certainly with not less than her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) usual
care, and immediately after breakfast seated herself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) desk,
nursing an idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would work as steadily for the next hour as
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) expected no special visitor. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did not write
a word of the task which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had prescribed to herself. Of course
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was disturbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) mind, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had dictated to herself
absolute quiescence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) almost knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had been wrong even to desire to see him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), and what more was there to be said? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had
seen the girl, and had in some fashion approved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) curiosity
had been satisfied, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) love of revenge had been sacrificed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
had no plan arranged as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) would now say to him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
at this moment attempt to make a plan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
was about to return to San Francisco with Fisker, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) did not
know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) had anything else to say. Then came the knock at the
door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) heart leaped within her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) made a last great effort
to be tranquil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) heard the steps on the stairs, and then the door
was opened and Mr. Montague was announced by Mrs. Pipkin herself.
Mrs. Pipkin, however, quite conquered by a feeling of gratitude to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) lodger, did not once look in through the door, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) pause
a moment to listen at the keyhole. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you would come and see
me once again before I went,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hurtle, not rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
sofa, but putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hand to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Sit there opposite, so
that we can look at one another. I hope it has not been a trouble to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I came when you left word for me to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly should not have expected it from any wish of your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have dared to come, had you not bade me. You know
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of the kind;--but as you are here we will not quarrel
as to your motives. Has Miss Carbury pardoned you as yet? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
forgiven your sins?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are friends,--if you mean that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you are friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) only wanted to have somebody to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that somebody had maligned you. It mattered not much who it was.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was ready to believe any one who would say a good word for you.
Perhaps I wasn't just the person to do it, but I believe even I was
sufficient to serve the turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you say a good word for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; no;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurtle/MRS. HURTLE/Hurtle</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Hurtle. <div class="bookquote">``I will not boast that I did. I do
not want to tell you fibs at our last meeting. I said nothing good
of you. What could I say of good? But I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) what was quite as
serviceable to you as though I had sung your virtues by the hour
without ceasing. I explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) how very badly you had behaved
to me. I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) know that from the moment you had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), you had
thrown me to the winds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not so, my friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did that matter? One does not scruple a lie for a friend, you
know! I could not go into all the little details of your perfidies.
I could not make her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) understand during one short and rather agonizing
interview how you had allowed yourself to be talked out of your
love for me by English propriety even before you had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
beautiful eyes. There was no reason why I should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) all my
disgrace,--anxious as I was to be of service. Besides, as I put it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was sure to be better pleased. But I did tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) how unwillingly
you had spared me an hour of your company;--what a trouble I had been
to you;--how you would have shirked me if you could!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Winifrid, that is untrue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That wretched journey to Lowestoft was the great crime. Mr. Roger
Carbury, who I own is poison to me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) or not I choose to have my own opinion, sir. I say that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) is poison to me, and I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had so stuffed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind with
the flagrant sin of that journey, with the peculiar wickedness of our
having lived for two nights under the same roof, with the awful fact
that we had travelled together in the same carriage, till that had
become the one stumbling block on your path to happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) never said a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) of our being there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who did then? But what matters? She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew it;--and, as the only
means of whitewashing you in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes, I did tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) how cruel and
how heartless you had been to me. I did explain how the return of
friendship which you had begun to show me, had been frozen, harder
than Wenham ice, by the appearance of Mr. Carbury on the sands.
Perhaps I went a little farther and hinted that the meeting had been
arranged as affording you the easiest means of escape from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not believe that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I had your welfare to look after; and the baser your conduct
had been to me, the truer you were in her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) eyes. Do I not deserve some
thanks for what I did? Surely you would not have had me tell her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) that
your conduct to me had been that of a loyal, loving gentleman. I
confessed to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) my utter despair;--I abased myself in the dust, as a
woman is abased who has been treacherously ill-used, and has failed
to avenge herself. I knew that when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sure that I was prostrate
and hopeless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be triumphant and contented. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on
your behalf how I had been ground to pieces under your chariot
wheels. And now you have not a word of thanks to give me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every word you say is a dagger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know where to go for salve for such skin-deep scratches as I
make. Where am I to find a surgeon who can put together my crushed

I have often thought of daggers? Why have I not thrust one into
your heart, so that I might rescue you from the arms of this puny,
spiritless English girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>All this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) was still seated, looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), leaning forward towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) brow.
<div class="bookquote">``But, Paul, I spit out my words to you, like any common woman, not
because they will hurt you, but because I know I may take that
comfort, such as it is, without hurting you. You are uneasy for a
moment while you are here, and I have a cruel pleasure in thinking
that you cannot answer me. But you will go from me to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and then
will you not be happy? When you are sitting with your arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
waist, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is playing with your smiles, will the memory of
my words interfere with your joy then? Ask yourself whether the prick
will last longer than the moment. But where am I to go for happiness
and joy? Can you understand what it is to have to live only on
retrospects?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could say a word to comfort you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot say a word to comfort me, unless you will unsay all that

know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) has been my enemy with you,--I shall return with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) to
San Francisco.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) is taking Madame Melmotte with him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>), and Melmotte's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope they will be kind to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/Paul Montague/Montague</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--but I will be kind to them. I have conquered others by being
kind, but I have never had much kindness myself. Did I not conquer
you, sir, by being gentle and gracious to you? Ah, how kind I was to
that poor wretch, till he (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) lost himself in drink! And then, Paul, I
used to think of better people, perhaps of softer people, of things
that should be clean and sweet and gentle,--of things that should
smell of lavender instead of wild garlic. I would dream of fair,
feminine women,--of women who would be scared by seeing what I saw,
who would die rather than do what I did. And then I met you, Paul,
and I said that my dreams should come true. I ought to have known
that it could not be so. I did not dare quite to tell you all the
truth. I know I was wrong, and now the punishment has come upon me.
Well;--I suppose you had better say good-bye to me. What is the good
of putting it off?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) chair and stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arms hanging listlessly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Winifrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) won't. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),--if we are right in supposing that they
who do good will be blessed for their good, and those who do evil
cursed for their evil? I cannot do good. I cannot bring myself
now not to wish that you would return to me. If you would come I
should care nothing for the misery of that girl,--nothing, at least
nothing now, for the misery I should certainly bring upon you. Look
here;--will you have this back?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) asked this she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) took from out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) bosom a small miniature portrait of himself which he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) in New York, and held it towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you wish it I will,--of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not part with it for all the gold in California. Nothing
on earth shall ever part me from it. Should I ever marry another
man,--as I may do,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must take me and this together. While I live
it shall be next my heart. As you know, I have but little respect for
the proprieties of life. I do not see why I am to abandon the picture
of the man I love because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) becomes the husband of another woman.
Having once said that I love you I shall not contradict myself
because you have deserted me. Paul, I have loved you, and do love
you,--oh, with my very heart of hearts.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) threw
herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) arms and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) face with kisses. <div class="bookquote">``For one

Oh, Paul, my love;--my love!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>All this to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) was simply agony,--though as she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had truly said it
was an agony he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would soon forget. But to be told by a woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
love,--without being able even to promise love in return,--to be so
told while you are in the very act of acknowledging your love for
another woman,--carries with it but little of the joy of triumph. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
did not want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raging like a tigress, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had once thought
might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) fate; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would have preferred the continuance of
moderate resentment to this flood of tenderness. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) stood
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waist, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) returned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) caresses;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did it with such stiff constraint that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at once felt how
chill they were. <div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, smiling through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bitter
tears,--<div class="bookquote">``there; you are released now, and not even my fingers shall

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we can hardly help;--can we? When two persons have made fools

again. Indeed it will be better that you should not. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by the hand, and stood for a moment looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), while

her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) would again kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) repulsed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), still smiling the while. <div class="bookquote">``No, sir; no; not again; never again,
never,--never,--never again.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>By that time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand
and stood apart from him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Paul;--and now go.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
turned round and left the room without uttering a word.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood still, without moving a limb, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) step
down the stairs and to the opening and the closing of the door. Then
hiding herself at the window with the scanty drapery of the curtain
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) went along the street. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) had turned the
corner she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came back to the centre of the room, stood for a moment
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms stretched out towards the walls, and then fell prone
upon the floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had spoken the very truth when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart.


<p/>-LSB-Illlustration: Mrs. Hurtle at the window.-RSB-


<p/>But that evening she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bade Mrs. Pipkin drink tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and was more
gracious to the poor woman than ever. When the obsequious but still
curious landlady asked some question about Mr. Montague, Mrs. Hurtle
seemed to speak very freely on the subject of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) late lover,--and to
speak without any great pain. They had put their heads together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
said, and had found that the marriage would not be suitable. Each of
them preferred their own country, and so they had agreed to part.
On that evening Mrs. Hurtle made herself more than usually pleasant,
having the children up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) room, and giving them jam and
bread-and-butter. During the whole of the next fortnight she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) seemed
to take a delight in doing all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) power for Mrs. Pipkin and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>)
family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) gave toys to the children, and absolutely bestowed upon
Mrs. Pipkin a new carpet for the drawing-room. Then Mr. Fisker came
and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) to America; and Mrs. Pipkin was left,--a
desolate but grateful woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They do tell bad things about them Americans,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pipkin</b></font>) said to a friend
in the street, <div class="bookquote">``and I don't pretend to know. But for a lodger, I only
wish Providence would send me another just like the one I have lost.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had that good nature about her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) liked to see the bairns eating
pudding just as if they was her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div><p/>I think Mrs. Pipkin was right, and that Mrs. Hurtle, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)
faults, was a good-natured woman.




<p/>CHAPTER XCVIII.

<p/>MARIE MELMOTTE``S FATE.


<p/>In the meantime Marie Melmotte was living with Madame Melmotte in
their lodgings up at Hampstead, and was taking quite a new look out
into the world. Fisker had become her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) devoted servant,--not with that
old-fashioned service which meant making love, but with perhaps a
truer devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) material interests. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had ascertained on her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>)
behalf that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) was the undoubted owner of the money which her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) father
had made over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first arrival in England,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) also
had made herself mistress of that fact with equal precision. It
would have astonished those who had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) six months since could
they now have seen how excellent a woman of business she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had become,
and how capable she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was of making the fullest use of Mr. Fisker's
services. In doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) justice it must be owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) kept
nothing back from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) learned, probably feeling
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) might best achieve success in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) present project by such
honesty,--feeling also, no doubt, the girl's own strength in
discovering truth and falsehood. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's own daughter,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said one day to Croll in Abchurch Lane;--for Croll, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)
had left Melmotte's employment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) name had been
forged, had now returned to the service of the daughter in some
undefined position, and had been engaged to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and Madame
Melmotte to New York.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah; yees,''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>said Croll, <div class="bookquote">``but bigger. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) vas passionate, and did lose
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) `ead; and vas blow'd up vid bigness.''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>Whereupon Croll made an
action as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) were a frog swelling himself to the dimensions
of an ox. '''E bursted himself, Mr. Fisker. ``E vas a great man; but
the greater he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vas always less and less vise. <div class="bookquote">``E ate so
much that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became too fat to see to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vittels.''  (<font color='red'><b>Croll/Herr Croll</b></font>)</div>It was thus
that Herr Croll analyzed the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) late master. <div class="bookquote">``But
Ma`me`selle,--ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is different. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) vill never eat too moch, but
vill see to eat alvays.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thus too he (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) analyzed the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>)
young mistress.

<p/>At first things did not arrange themselves pleasantly between Madame
Melmotte and Marie. The reader will perhaps remember that they were
in no way connected by blood. Madame Melmotte was not Marie's mother,
nor, in the eye of the law, could Marie claim Melmotte as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was alone in the world, absolutely without a relation, not
knowing even what had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mother's name,--not even knowing what
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father's true name, as in the various biographies of the
great man which were, as a matter of course, published within a
fortnight of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death, various accounts were given as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) birth,
parentage, and early history. The general opinion seemed to be that
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father had been a noted coiner in New York,--an Irishman of the
name of Melmody,--and, in one memoir, the probability of the descent
was argued from Melmotte's skill in forgery. But Marie, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
was thus isolated, and now altogether separated from the lords and
duchesses who a few weeks since had been interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) career,
was the undoubted owner of the money,--a fact which was beyond the
comprehension of Madame Melmotte. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could understand,--and was
delighted to understand,--that a very large sum of money had been
saved from the wreck, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) might therefore look forward to
prosperous tranquillity for the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) life. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) never
acknowledged so much to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) soon learned to regard the
removal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) husband as the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) troubles. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could
not comprehend why Marie should claim all the money as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) declared herself to be quite willing to divide the spoil,--and
suggested such an arrangement both to Marie and to Croll. Of Fisker
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was afraid, thinking that the iniquity of giving all the money
to Marie originated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>), in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) might obtain it
by marrying the girl. Croll, who understood it all perfectly,
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) the story a dozen times,--but quite in vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) made a
timid suggestion of employing a lawyer on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own behalf, and was
only deterred from doing so by Marie's ready assent to such an
arrangement. Marie's equally ready surrender of any right she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) might
have to a portion of the jewels which had been saved had perhaps
some effect in softening the elder lady's heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thus was in
possession of a treasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own,--though a treasure small in
comparison with that of the younger woman; and the younger woman had
promised that in the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be liberal.

<p/>It was distinctly understood that they were both to go to New York
under Mr. Fisker's guidance as soon as things should be sufficiently
settled to allow of their departure; and Madame Melmotte was told,
about the middle of August, that their places had been taken for the
3rd of September. But nothing more was told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not as yet
know whether Marie was to go out free or as the affianced bride of
Hamilton Fisker. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) felt herself injured by being left so much
in the dark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) herself was inimical to Fisker, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) as a
dark, designing man, who would ultimately swallow up all that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)
husband had left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),--and trusted herself entirely to Croll,
who was personally attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). Fisker was, of course, going
on to San Francisco. Marie also had talked of crossing the American
continent. But Madame Melmotte was disposed to think that for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>),
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) jewels, and such share of the money as Marie might be
induced to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), New York would be the most fitting residence.
Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) drag herself across the continent to California? Herr
Croll had declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) purpose of remaining in New York. Then it
occurred to the lady that as Melmotte was a name which might be too
well known in New York, and which it therefore might be wise to
change, Croll would do as well as any other. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and Herr Croll had
known each other for a great many years, and were, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought, of
about the same age. Croll had some money saved. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had, at any rate,
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) jewels,--and Croll would probably be able to get some portion of
all that money, which ought to be hers, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>) affairs were made to
be identical with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own. So she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smiled upon Croll, and whispered
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Croll</b></font>); and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had given Croll two glasses of Curaçoa,--which
comforter she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kept in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own hands, as safe-guarded almost as the
jewels,--then Croll understood her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>But it was essential that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should know what Marie intended to do.
Marie was anything but communicative, and certainly was not in any
way submissive. <div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said one day, asking the question in
French, without any preface or apology, <div class="bookquote">``are you going to be married
to Mr. Fisker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>French</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you ask that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so important I should know. Where am I to live? What am I to
do? What money shall I have? Who will be a friend to me? A woman
ought to know. You will marry Fisker if you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). Why cannot you
tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I do not know. When I know I will tell you. If you go on
asking me till to-morrow morning I can say no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And this was true. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) did not know. It certainly was not Fisker's
fault that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) should still be in the dark as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own destiny, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) often enough, and had pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) suit with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
eloquence. But Marie had now been wooed so often that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) felt the
importance of the step which was suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). The romance of
the thing was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) a good deal worn, and the material view of
matrimony had also been damaged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had fallen in love
with Sir Felix Carbury, and had assured herself over and over again
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) worshipped the very ground on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) stood. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
taught herself this business of falling in love as a lesson, rather
than felt it. After her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) father's first attempts to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to this
and that suitor because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) wealth,--attempts which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had hardly
opposed amidst the consternation and glitter of the world to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was suddenly introduced,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had learned from novels that it
would be right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should be in love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had chosen Sir
Felix as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) idol. The reader knows what had been the end of that
episode in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) certainly was not now in love with Sir Felix
Carbury. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had as it were relapsed into the hands of Lord
Nidderdale,--one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) early suitors,--and had felt that as love was
not to prevail, and as it would be well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should marry some
one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) might probably be as good as any other, and certainly better
than many others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had almost learned to like Lord Nidderdale and
to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), when the tragedy came. Lord Nidderdale
had been very good-natured,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) had deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had never allowed herself to be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) for a moment. It had
been a matter of course that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) should do so. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) fortune was still
large, but not so large as the sum named in the bargain made. And it
was moreover weighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) father's blood. From the moment of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) father's death she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had never dreamed that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>).
Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thoughts in reference to Sir Felix were bitter
enough;--but as against Nidderdale they were not at all bitter.
Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) ever meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) again she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Nidderdale</b></font>) and
smile,--if not pleasantly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) thought of the things which were
past,--at any rate with good humour. But all this had not made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) much in love with matrimony generally. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had over a hundred
thousand pounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own, and, feeling conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own power
in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own money, knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) pleased
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) wealth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) began to look out into life seriously.

<p/>What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) money, and in what way would she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) shape her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
life, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) determine to remain her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own mistress? Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) to
refuse Fisker how should she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) begin? He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) would then be banished, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) only remaining friends, the only persons whose names she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) would
even know in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own country, would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father's widow and
Herr Croll. She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) already began to see Madame Melmotte's purport in
reference to Croll, and could not reconcile herself to the idea of
opening an establishment with them on a scale commensurate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
fortune. Nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) settle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own mind any pleasant position
for herself as a single woman, living alone in perfect independence.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) had opinions of women's rights,--especially in regard to money;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) entertained also a vague notion that in America a young woman
would not need support so essentially as in England. Nevertheless,
the idea of a fine house for herself in Boston, or Philadelphia,--for
in that case she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have to avoid New York as the chosen residence
of Madame Melmotte,--did not recommend itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). As to Fisker
himself,--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) certainly liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was not beautiful like Felix
Carbury, nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) the easy good-humour of Lord Nidderdale. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
seen enough of English gentlemen to know that Fisker was very unlike
them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not seen enough of English gentlemen to make Fisker
distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) had a big house at San
Francisco, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) certainly desired to live in a big house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
represented himself to be a thriving man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) calculated that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) certainly would not be here, in London, arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) father's
affairs, were he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not possessed of commercial importance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
contrived to learn that, in the United States, a married woman
has greater power over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own money than in England, and this
information acted strongly in Fisker's favour. On consideration of
the whole subject she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was inclined to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would do better
in the world as Mrs. Fisker than as Marie Melmotte,--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) could see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) way clearly in the matter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) own money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have got excellent berths,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fisker/Hamilton K. Fisker/Hamilton Fisker</b></font>)</div>Fisker said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) one morning at
Hampstead. At these interviews, which were devoted first to business
and then to love, Madame Melmotte was never allowed to be present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am to be alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. There is a cabin for Madame Melmotte and the maid, and a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes;--but you had better not mention him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is not exactly

something of Mrs. Hurtle's story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a story, and I dare say I shall tell you all about it some

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't that. Come, Miss Melmotte, you know what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go in for life together. We've both done uncommon well. I'm
spending 30,000 dollars a year,--at that rate,--in my own house.
You'll see it all. If we put them both together,--what's yours and
what's mine,--we can put our foot out as far as about any one there,
I guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I care about putting my foot out. I've seen
something of that already, Mr. Fisker. You shouldn't put your foot
out farther than you can draw it in again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't fear me as to that, Miss Melmotte. I shouldn't be able
to touch a dollar of your money. It would be such a triumph to go
into Francisco as man and wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think of being married till I had been there a while and
looked about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And seen the house! Well;--there's something in that. The house is
all there, I can tell you. I'm not a bit afraid but what you'll like
the house. But if we were engaged, I could do every thing for you.
Where would you be, going into San Francisco all alone? Oh, Miss
Melmotte, I do admire you so much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I doubt whether this last assurance had much efficacy. But the
arguments with which it was introduced did prevail to a certain
extent. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you how it must be then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How shall it be?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) asked the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) jumped up and put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) waist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not like that, Mr. Fisker,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) said, withdrawing herself. <div class="bookquote">``It shall
be in this way. You may consider yourself engaged to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm the happiest man on this continent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) said, forgetting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>)
ecstasy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was not in the United States.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I find when I get to Francisco anything to induce me to
change my mind, I shall change it. I like you very well, but I'm not
going to take a leap in the dark, and I'm not going to marry a pig in
a poke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you're quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) said,--<div class="bookquote">``quite right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may give it out on board the ship that we're engaged, and I'll
tell Madame Melmotte the same. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and Croll don't mean going any
farther than New York.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We needn't break our hearts about that;--need we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't much signify. Well;--I'll go on with Mrs. Hurtle, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)'ll
have me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too much delighted she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>)'ll be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) shall be told we're engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I don't like it when I get to Frisco, as you call it, all the
ropes in California shan't make me do it. Well;--yes; you may give
me a kiss I suppose now if you care about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fisker/MR. FISKER</b></font>)</div>And so,--or rather so
far,--Mr. Fisker and Marie Melmotte became engaged to each other as
man and wife.

<p/>After that Mr. Fisker's remaining business in England went very
smoothly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>). It was understood up at Hampstead that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisker</b></font>) was
engaged to Marie Melmotte,--and it soon came to be understood also
that Madame Melmotte was to be married to Herr Croll. No doubt the
father of the one lady and the husband of the other had died so
recently as to make these arrangements subject to certain censorious
objections. But there was a feeling that Melmotte had been so unlike
other men, both in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) life and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) death, that they who had been
concerned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) were not to be weighed by ordinary scales. Nor did
it much matter, for the persons concerned took their departure soon
after the arrangement was made, and Hampstead knew them no more.

<p/>On the 3rd of September Madame Melmotte, Marie, Mrs. Hurtle, Hamilton
K. Fisker, and Herr Croll left Liverpool for New York; and the three
ladies were determined that they never would revisit a country of
which their reminiscences certainly were not happy. The writer of the
present chronicle may so far look forward,--carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) reader with
him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>),--as to declare that Marie Melmotte did become Mrs. Fisker very
soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Melmotte</b></font>) arrival at San Francisco.




<p/>CHAPTER XCIX.

<p/>LADY CARBURY AND MR. BROUNE.


<p/>When Sir Felix Carbury declared to his (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) friends at the Beargarden that
he (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) intended to devote the next few months of his (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) life to foreign
travel, and that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) purpose to take with him (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) a Protestant
divine,--as was much the habit with young men of rank and fortune
some years since,--he (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) was not altogether lying. There was indeed
a sounder basis of truth than was usually to be found attached to
his (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) statements. That he (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) should have intended to produce a false
impression was a matter of course,--and nearly equally so that he (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>)
should have made his (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) attempt by asserting things which he (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) must have
known that no one would believe. He (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) was going to Germany, and he (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>) was
going in company with a clergyman, and it had been decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>BROUNE</b></font>)
should remain there for the next twelve months. A representation had
lately been made to the Bishop of London that the English Protestants
settled in a certain commercial town in the north-eastern district of
Prussia were without pastoral aid, and the bishop had stirred himself
in the matter. A clergyman was found willing to expatriate himself,
but the income suggested was very small. The Protestant English
population of the commercial town in question, though pious, was not
liberal. It had come to pass that the <div class="bookquote">``Morning Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had
interested itself in the matter, having appealed for subscriptions
after a manner not unusual with that paper. The bishop and all those
concerned in the matter had fully understood that if the <div class="bookquote">``Morning
Breakfast Table''  (<font color='red'><b>The bishop</b></font>)</div>could be got to take the matter up heartily, the
thing would be done. The heartiness had been so complete that it had
at last devolved upon Mr. Broune to appoint the clergyman; and, as
with all the aid that could be found, the income was still small, the
Rev. Septimus Blake,--a brand snatched from the burning of Rome,--had
been induced to undertake the maintenance and total charge of Sir
Felix Carbury for a consideration. Mr. Broune imparted to Mr. Blake
all that there was to know about the baronet, giving much counsel
as to the management of the young man, and specially enjoining
on the clergyman that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) should on no account give Sir Felix the
means of returning home. It was evidently Mr. Broune's anxious wish
that Sir Felix should see as much as possible of German life, at a
comparatively moderate expenditure, and under circumstances that
should be externally respectable if not absolutely those which a
young gentleman might choose for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own comfort or profit;--but
especially that those circumstances should not admit of the speedy
return to England of the young gentleman himself.

<p/>Lady Carbury had at first opposed the scheme. Terribly difficult
as was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) the burden of maintaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not
endure the idea of driving him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) into exile. But Mr. Broune was very
obstinate, very reasonable, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought, somewhat hard of
heart. <div class="bookquote">``What is to be the end of it then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>), almost in
anger. For in those days the great editor, when in presence of Lady
Carbury, differed very much from that Mr. Broune who used to squeeze
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hand and look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) manner with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had become so
different that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) as quite another person. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hardly
dared to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>), and found herself almost compelled to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) really felt and thought. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to let him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eat
up everything you have to your last shilling, and then go to the
workhouse with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my friend, you know how I am struggling! Do not say such horrid
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because I know how you are struggling that I find myself
compelled to say anything on the subject. What hardship will there be
in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) living for twelve months with a clergyman in Prussia? What can
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) do better? What better chance can he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) have of being weaned from the
life he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is leading?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could only be married!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married! Who is to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? Why should any girl with money throw
herself away upon him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is so handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) beauty brought him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to? Lady Carbury, you must let me
tell you that all that is not only foolish but wrong. If you keep him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
here you will help to ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and will certainly ruin yourself. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
has agreed to go;--let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was forced to yield. Indeed, as Sir Felix had himself assented,
it was almost impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) should not do so. Perhaps Mr.
Broune's greatest triumph was due to the talent and firmness with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) persuaded Sir Felix to start upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) travels. <div class="bookquote">``Your
mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune, <div class="bookquote">``has made up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will
not absolutely beggar your sister and herself in order that your
indulgence may be prolonged for a few months. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot make you
go to Germany of course. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can turn you out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house, and,
unless you go, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ever said that, Mr. Broune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No;--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has not said so. But I have said it for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
presence; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has acknowledged that it must necessarily be so.
You may take my word as a gentleman that it will be so. If you take
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) advice #175 a year will be paid for your maintenance;--but if you
remain in England not a shilling further will be paid.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had no
money. His (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) last sovereign was all but gone. Not a tradesman would
give him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) credit for a coat or a pair of boots. The key of the
door had been taken away from him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>). The very page treated him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) with
contumely. His (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) clothes were becoming rusty. There was no prospect
of amusement for him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) during the coming autumn or winter. He (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) did not
anticipate much excitement in Eastern Prussia, but he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) thought that
any change must be a change for the better. He (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) assented, therefore,
to the proposition made by Mr. Broune, was duly introduced to the
Rev. Septimus Blake, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) last sovereign on a last
dinner at the Beargarden, explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) intentions for the immediate
future to those friends at his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) club who would no doubt mourn his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>)
departure.

<p/>Mr. Blake and Mr. Broune between them did not allow the grass to
grow under their feet. Before the end of August Sir Felix, with
Mr. and Mrs. Blake and the young Blakes, had embarked from Hull
for Hamburgh,--having extracted at the very hour of parting a last
five-pound note from his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) foolish mother. <div class="bookquote">``It will be just enough to
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune with angry energy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was told
of this. But Lady Carbury, who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son well, assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) that
Felix would be restrained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) expenditure by no such prudence as
such a purpose would indicate. <div class="bookquote">``It will be gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``long
before they reach their destination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why the deuce should you give it him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune.

<p/>Mr. Broune's anxiety had been so intense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had paid half a
year's allowance in advance to Mr. Blake out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) own pocket.
Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) had paid various sums for Lady Carbury,--so that that
unfortunate woman would often tell herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was becoming
subject to the great editor, almost like a slave. He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
three or four times a week, at about nine o'clock in the evening, and
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) instructions as to all that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should do. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't write
another novel if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) said. This was hard, as the writing
of novels was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) great ambition, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had flattered herself that
the one novel which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had written was good. Mr. Broune's own critic
had declared it to be very good in glowing language. The <div class="bookquote">``Evening
Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had of course abused it,--because it is the nature of the
<div class="bookquote">``Evening Pulpit''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to abuse. So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had argued with herself, telling
herself that the praise was all true, whereas the censure had come
from malice. After that article in the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>it did seem
hard that Mr. Broune should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to write no more novels. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) piteously but said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you'd
find it answer. Of course you can do it as well as a great many
others. But then that is saying so little!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I could make some money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think Mr. Leadham would hold out to you very high hopes;--I
don't, indeed. I think I would turn to something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so very hard to get paid for what one does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Mr. Broune made no immediate answer; but, after sitting for
a while, almost in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) leave. On that very morning
Lady Carbury had parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was soon about to part from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was very sad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could hardly
keep up that house in Welbeck Street for herself, even if her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) means
permitted it. What should she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) do with herself? Whither should she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
take herself? Perhaps the bitterest drop in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cup had come from
those words of Mr. Broune forbidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to write more novels. After
all, then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was not a clever woman,--not more clever than other
women around her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)! That very morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had prided herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
coming success as a novelist, basing all her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) hopes on that review in
the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table.''  (<font color='red'><b>a novelist</b></font>)</div>Now, with that reaction of spirits which is so
common to all of us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was more than equally despondent. He (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) would
not thus have crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) without a reason. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) was hard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
now,--he (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) who used to be so soft,--he (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) was very good. It did not occur
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to rebel against him (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>). After what he (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) had said, of course there
would be no more praise in the <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast Table,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and, equally of
course, no novel of hers could succeed without that. The more she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>), the more omnipotent he (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) seemed to be. The more she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
thought of herself, the more absolutely prostrate she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) seemed to have
fallen from those high hopes with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had begun her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) literary
career not much more than twelve months ago.

<p/>On the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) did not come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) at all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sat idle,
wretched, and alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not interest herself in Hetta's coming
marriage, as that marriage was in direct opposition to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
broken schemes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had not ventured to confess so much to Mr.
Broune, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had in truth written the first pages of the first
chapter of a second novel. It was impossible now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should even
look at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had written. All this made her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) very sad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) spent
the evening quite alone; for Hetta was staying down in Suffolk, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) cousin's friend, Mrs. Yeld, the bishop's wife; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life past and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) life to come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did, perhaps, with a
broken light, see something of the error of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) ways, and did, after
a fashion, repent. It was all <div class="bookquote">``leather or prunello,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said to
herself;--it was all vanity,--and vanity,--and vanity! What real
enjoyment had she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found in anything? She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had only taught herself to
believe that some day something would come which she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would like;--but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had never as yet in truth found anything to like. It had all been
in anticipation,--but now even her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) anticipations were at an end. Mr.
Broune had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) son away, had forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to write any more
novels,--and had been refused when he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)!

<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) as usual, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) still very
wretched. <div class="bookquote">``I shall give up this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can't afford to
keep it; and in truth I shall not want it. I don't in the least know
where to go, but I don't think that it much signifies. Any place will
be the same to me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why you should say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't think of going out of London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? I suppose I had better go wherever I can live cheapest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be sorry that you should be settled where I could not see
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune plaintively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So shall I,--very. You have been more kind to me than anybody.
But what am I to do? If I stay in London I can live only in some
miserable lodgings. I know you will laugh at me, and tell me that I
am wrong; but my idea is that I shall follow Felix wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) goes,
so that I may be near him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and help him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) needs help. Hetta
doesn't want me. There is nobody else that I can do any good to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Broune, very quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,--that is so kind of you. There is nothing makes one so good
as goodness;--nothing binds your friend to you so firmly as the
acceptance from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of friendly actions. You say you want me, because
I have so sadly wanted you. When I go you will simply miss an almost
daily trouble, but where shall I find a friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I said I wanted you, I meant more than that, Lady Carbury. Two
or three months ago I asked you to be my wife. You declined, chiefly,
if I understood you rightly, because of your son's position. That has
been altered, and therefore I ask you again. I have quite convinced
myself,--not without some doubts, for you shall know all; but, still,
I have quite convinced myself,--that such a marriage will best
contribute to my own happiness. I do not think, dearest, that it
would mar yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>This was said with so quiet a voice and so placid a demeanour, that
the words, though they were too plain to be misunderstood, hardly at
first brought themselves home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>)
offer of marriage, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) had done so in a tone which almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
feel that the proposition could not be an earnest one. It was not
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) was joking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) or paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) a poor
insipid compliment. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought about it at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) knew that
it could not be so. But the thing was so improbable! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) opinion of
herself was so poor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had become so sick of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own vanities and
littlenesses and pretences, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) could not understand that such
a man as this should in truth want to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. At this
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) thought less of herself and more of Mr. Broune than either
perhaps deserved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) sat silent, quite unable to look him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) in the
face, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) arm-chair, lounging back, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) eyes intent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) countenance. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``what do you
think of it? I never loved you better than I did for refusing me
before, because I thought that you did so because it was not right
that I should be embarrassed by your son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was the reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said, almost in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I shall love you better still for accepting me now,--if you will
accept me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The long vista of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) past life appeared before her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) eyes. The
ambition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) youth which had been taught to look only to a
handsome maintenance, the cruelty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) husband which had driven
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) to run from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), the further cruelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) forgiveness when she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); the calumny which had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) miserable, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
had never confessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) misery; then her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) attempts at life in London,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) literary successes and failures, and the wretchedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
son's career;--there had never been happiness, or even comfort, in
any of it. Even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) smiles had been sweetest her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) heart had been
heaviest. Could it be that now at last real peace should be within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) reach, and that tranquillity which comes from an anchor holding
to a firm bottom? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) remembered that first kiss,--or attempted
kiss,--when, with a sort of pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own superiority, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had
told herself that the man was a susceptible old goose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) certainly
had not thought then that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) susceptibility was of this nature.
Nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) quite understand now whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) had been right then,
and that the man's feelings, and almost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature, had since
changed,--or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) from first to last. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained silent it was necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) should answer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You
can hardly have thought of it enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought of it a good deal too. I have been thinking of it for
six months at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is so much against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there against you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say bad things of me in India.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know all about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Broune/Broune/MR. BROUNE</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Broune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Felix!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I may say that I know all about that also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then I have become so poor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not proposing to myself to marry you for your money. Luckily
for me,--I hope luckily for both of us,--it is not necessary that I
should do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then I seem so to have fallen through in everything. I don't
know what I've got to give to a man in return for all that you offer
to give to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) said, stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) right hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>). And there
he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) sat with it stretched out,--so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) found herself compelled
to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own into it, or to refuse to do so with very absolute
words. Very slowly she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own, and gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) without
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>), and in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was
kneeling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) feet, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) face buried on his (<font color='blue'><b>Broune</b></font>) knees. Considering
their ages perhaps we must say that their attitude was awkward. They
would certainly have thought so themselves had they imagined that
any one could have seen them. But how many absurdities of the kind
are not only held to be pleasant, but almost holy,--as long as they
remain mysteries inspected by no profane eyes! It is not that Age
is ashamed of feeling passion and acknowledging it,--but that the
display of it is, without the graces of which Youth is proud, and
which Age regrets.

<p/>On that occasion there was very little more said between them. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had
certainly been in earnest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) had now accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) went
down to his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) office he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) told himself now that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had done the best, not
only for her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) but for himself also. And yet I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) had won
him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) more thoroughly by her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) former refusal than by any other virtue.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) sat alone, late into the night, became subject to a
thorough reaction of spirit. That morning the world had been a
perfect blank to her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>). There was no single object of interest before
her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>). Now everything was rose-coloured. This man who had thus bound
her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), who had given her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) such assured proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection
and truth, was one of the considerable ones of the world; a man than
whom few,--so she (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) now told herself,--were greater or more powerful.
Was it not a career enough for any woman to be the wife of such a
man, to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends, and to shine with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reflected glory?

<p/>Whether her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hopes were realised, or,--as human hopes never are
realised,--how far her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) content was assured, these pages cannot tell;
but they must tell that, before the coming winter was over, Lady
Carbury became the wife of Mr. Broune, and, in furtherance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own
resolve, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) husband's name. The house in Welbeck Street was
kept, and Mrs. Broune's Tuesday evenings were much more regarded by
the literary world than had been those of Lady Carbury.




<p/>CHAPTER C.

<p/>DOWN IN SUFFOLK.


<p/>It need hardly be said that Paul Montague was not long in adjusting
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) affairs with Hetta after the visit which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) received from Roger
Carbury. Early on the following morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was once more in Welbeck
Street, taking the brooch with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>); and though at first Lady Carbury
kept up her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) opposition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) did it after so weak a fashion as to
throw in fact very little difficulty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) way. Hetta understood
perfectly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) was in this matter stronger than her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mother
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) need fear nothing, now that Roger Carbury was on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean to live on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>Lady Carbury
said, threatening future evils in a plaintive tone. Hetta repeated,
though in other language, the assurance which the young lady made
who declared that if her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) future husband would consent to live on
potatoes, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be quite satisfied with the potato-peelings;
while Paul made some vague allusion to the satisfactory nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
final arrangements with the house of Fisker, Montague, and Montague.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't see anything like an income,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Lady Carbury; <div class="bookquote">``but I
suppose Roger will make it right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) takes everything upon himself
now it seems.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Carbury/LADY CARBURY/Carbury</b></font>)</div>But this was before the halcyon day of Mr. Broune's
second offer.

<p/>It was at any rate decided that they were to be married, and the time
fixed for the marriage was to be the following spring. When this was
finally arranged Roger Carbury, who had returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) own home,
conceived the idea that it would be well that Hetta should pass the
autumn and if possible the winter also down in Suffolk, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
might get used to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in the capacity which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) now aspired to fill;
and with that object he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) induced Mrs. Yeld, the Bishop's wife, to
invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) down to the palace. Hetta accepted the invitation and left
London before she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) could hear the tidings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) mother's engagement
with Mr. Broune.

<p/>Roger Carbury had not yielded in this matter,--had not brought
himself to determine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would recognise Paul and Hetta
as acknowledged lovers,--without a fierce inward contest. Two
convictions had been strong in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) mind, both of which were opposed
to this recognition,--the first telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) would be a fitter
husband for the girl than Paul Montague, and the second assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>)
that Paul had ill-treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) in such a fashion that forgiveness
would be both foolish and unmanly. For Roger, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was
a religious man, and one anxious to conform to the spirit of
Christianity, would not allow himself to think that an injury should
be forgiven unless the man who did the injury repented of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
injustice. As to giving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat to the thief who had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cloak,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told himself that were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and others to be guided by
that precept honest industry would go naked in order that vice and
idleness might be comfortably clothed. If any one stole his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cloak he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would certainly put that man in prison as soon as possible and not
commence his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lenience till the thief should at any rate affect to be
sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fault. Now, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinking, Paul Montague had stolen
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cloak, and were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Roger, to give way in this matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
love, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would be giving Paul his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) coat also. No! He (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was bound after
some fashion to have Paul put into prison; to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) before a
jury, and to get a verdict against him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), so that some sentence of
punishment might be at least pronounced. How then could he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) yield?

<p/>And Paul Montague had shown himself to be very weak in regard to
women. It might be,--no doubt it was true,--that Mrs. Hurtle's
appearance in England had been distressing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>). But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
had gone down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) to Lowestoft as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurtle</b></font>) lover, and, to Roger's
thinking, a man who could do that was quite unfit to be the husband
of Hetta Carbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would himself tell no tales against Montague
on that head. Even when pressed to do so he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had told no tale. But
not the less was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) conviction strong that Hetta ought to know the
truth, and to be induced by that knowledge to reject her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) younger
lover.

<p/>But then over these convictions there came a third,--equally
strong,--which told him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) that the girl loved the younger man and did
not love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved the girl it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty as a
man to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love by doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) happy. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked up and down the walk by the moat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands clasped
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, stopping every now and again to sit on the terrace
wall,--walking there, mile after mile, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind intent on the
one idea,--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) schooled himself to feel that that, and that only,
could be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty. What did love mean if not that? What could be the
devotion which men so often affect to feel if it did not tend to
self-sacrifice on behalf of the beloved one? A man would incur any
danger for a woman, would subject himself to any toil,--would even
die for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! But if this were done simply with the object of winning
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), where was that real love of which sacrifice of self on behalf
of another is the truest proof? So, by degrees, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolved that the
thing must be done. The man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been bad to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend,
was not all bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was one who might become good in good hands.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Roger, was too firm of purpose and too honest of heart to buoy
himself up into new hopes by assurances of the man's unfitness.
What right had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could judge of that better than
the girl herself? And so, when many many miles had been walked, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
succeeded in conquering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own heart,--though in conquering it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
crushed it,--and in bringing himself to the resolve that the energies
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life should be devoted to the task of making Mrs. Paul
Montague a happy woman. We have seen how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acted up to this resolve
when last in London, withdrawing at any rate all signs of anger from
Paul Montague and behaving with the utmost tenderness to Hetta.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had accomplished that task of conquering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own heart and
of assuring himself thoroughly that Hetta was to become his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rival's
wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, I think, more at ease and less troubled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spirit
than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been during those months in which there had still been
doubt. The sort of happiness which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once pictured to himself
could certainly never be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never marry he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite
sure. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was prepared to settle Carbury on Hetta's eldest boy
on condition that such boy should take the old name. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would never
have a child whom he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could in truth call his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could
induce these people to live at Carbury, or to live there for at least
a part of the year, so that there should be some life in the place,
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could awaken himself again, and again take an
interest in the property. But as a first step to this he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must learn
to regard himself as an old man,--as one who had let life pass by too
far for the purposes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own home, and who must therefore devote
himself to make happy the homes of others.

<p/>So thinking of himself and so resolving, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told much of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
story to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend the Bishop, and as a consequence of those
revelations Mrs. Yeld had invited Hetta down to the palace. Roger
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) had still much to say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin before her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) marriage
which could be said in the country much better than in town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
wished to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) to regard Suffolk as the county to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>)
should be attached and in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) was to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) home. The day
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) came he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was over at the palace with the pretence of asking
permission to come and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Yeld</b></font>) arrival, but
in truth with the idea of talking about Hetta to the only friend to
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had looked for sympathy in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) trouble. <div class="bookquote">``As to settling your
property on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bishop</b></font>)</div>said the Bishop, <div class="bookquote">``it is quite out
of the question. Your lawyer would not allow you to do it. Where
would you be if after all you were to marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bishop</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely not,--but yet you may. How is a man of your age to
speak with certainty of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will do or what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will not do in
that respect? You can make your will, doing as you please with your
property;--and the will, when made, can be revoked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you hardly understand just what I feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger, <div class="bookquote">``and
I know very well that I am unable to explain it. But I wish to act
exactly as I would do if she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were my daughter, and as if her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a son, would be my natural heir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, if she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were your daughter, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son wouldn't be your natural
heir as long as there was a probability or even a chance that you
might have a son of your own. A man should never put the power, which
properly belongs to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hands. If it does properly
belong to you it must be better with you than elsewhere. I think very
highly of your cousin, and I have no reason to think otherwise than
well of the gentleman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intends to marry. But it is only human
nature to suppose that the fact that your property is still at your
own disposal should have some effect in producing a more complete
observance of your wishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe it in the least, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roger/Roger Carbury/Mr. Carbury</b></font>)</div>said Roger somewhat
angrily.

<p/>``That is because you are so carried away by enthusiasm at the
present moment as to ignore the ordinary rules of life. There are
not, perhaps, many fathers who have Regans and Gonerils for their
daughters;--but there are very many who may take a lesson from the
folly of the old king. ``Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,<div class="bookquote">'' the
fool said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>), `when thou gav`st thy golden one away.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The world,
I take it, thinks that the fool was right.''

<p/>The Bishop did so far succeed that Roger abandoned the idea of
settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) property on Paul Montague's children. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) was not on
that account the less resolute in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) determination to make himself
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own interests subordinate to those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) cousin. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
came over, two days afterwards, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) in the
garden, and walked there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) for a couple of hours. <div class="bookquote">``I hope all
our troubles are over now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) said smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean about Felix,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div>said Hetta,--<div class="bookquote">``and mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetta/Hetta Carbury/HETTA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. As to Felix I think that Lady Carbury has done the best
thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) power. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Carbury</b></font>) has been advised by Mr. Broune, and
Mr. Broune seems to be a prudent man. And about your mother herself,
I hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may now be comfortable. But I was not alluding to
Felix and your mother. I was thinking of you--and of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that you will never have any troubles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had troubles. I mean to speak very freely to you now, dear.
I was nearly upset,--what I suppose people call broken-hearted,--when
I was assured that you certainly would never become my wife. I ought
not to have allowed myself to get into such a frame of mind. I should
have known that I was too old to have a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Roger,--it was not that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,--that and other things. I should have known it sooner, and
have got over my misery quicker. I should have been more manly and
stronger. After all, though love is a wonderful incident in a man's
life, it is not that only that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is here for. I have duties plainly
marked out for me; and as I should never allow myself to be withdrawn
from them by pleasure, so neither should I by sorrow. But it is done
now. I have conquered my regrets, and I can say with safety that I
look forward to your presence and Paul's presence at Carbury as the
source of all my future happiness. I will make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) welcome as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were my brother, and you as though you were my daughter. All I ask
of you is that you will not be chary of your presence there.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>)
only answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) by a close pressure on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``That is what I
wanted to say to you. You will teach yourself to regard me as your
best and closest friend,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) on whom you have the strongest right
to depend, of all,--except your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no teaching necessary for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As a daughter leans on a father I would have you lean on me, Hetta.
You will soon come to find that I am very old. I grow old quickly,
and already feel myself to be removed from everything that is young
and foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never were foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor young either, I sometimes think. But now you must promise me
this. You will do all that you can to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to make Carbury his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
residence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have no plans as yet at all, Roger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it will be certainly so much the easier for you to fall into my
plan. Of course you will be married at Carbury?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will mamma say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) will come here, and I am sure will enjoy it. That I regard as
settled. Then, after that, let this be your home,--so that you should
learn really to care about and to love the place. It will be your
home really, you know, some of these days. You will have to be Squire
of Carbury yourself when I am gone, till you have a son old enough
to fill that exalted position.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>)
good-will to them both, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) could not bring himself to say that Paul
Montague should be Squire of Carbury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Roger, please do not talk like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is necessary, my dear. I want you to know what my wishes
are, and, if it be possible, I would learn what are yours. My mind
is quite made up as to my future life. Of course, I do not wish to
dictate to you,--and if I did, I could not dictate to Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,--pray do not call him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) Mr. Montague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I will not;--to Paul then. There goes the last of my anger.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands up as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) were scattering his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) indignation
to the air. <div class="bookquote">``I would not dictate either to you or to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>), but it
is right that you should know that I hold my property as steward
for those who are to come after me, and that the satisfaction of my
stewardship will be infinitely increased if I find that those for
whom I act share the interest which I shall take in the matter. It is
the only payment which you and he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) can make me for my trouble.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Felix, Roger!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) brow became a little black as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``To a sister,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said very solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``I will not say a word against her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother;
but on that subject I claim a right to come to a decision on my
own judgment. It is a matter in which I have thought much, and, I
may say, suffered much. I have ideas, old-fashioned ideas, on the
matter, which I need not pause to explain to you now. If we are as
much together as I hope we shall be, you will, no doubt, come to
understand them. The disposition of a family property, even though
it be one so small as mine, is, to my thinking, a matter which a man
should not make in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own caprices,--or even with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own affections. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owes a duty to those who live on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) land, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owes a duty to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country. And, though it may seem fantastic to
say so, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owes a duty to those who have been before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
who have manifestly wished that the property should be continued in
the hands of their descendants. These things are to me very holy. In
what I am doing I am in some respects departing from the theory of
my life,--but I do so under a perfect conviction that by the course
I am taking I shall best perform the duties to which I have alluded.
I do not think, Hetta, that we need say any more about that.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
had spoken so seriously, that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did not quite understand
all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) did not venture to dispute his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) will any
further. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) did not endeavour to exact from her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) any promise, but
having explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) purposes, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Montague</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would have kissed
a daughter, and then left her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and rode home without going into the
house.

<p/>Soon after that, Paul Montague came down to Carbury, and the same
thing was said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), though in a much less solemn manner. Paul was
received quite in the old way. Having declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) would throw
all anger behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), and that Paul should be again Paul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) rigidly
kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) promise, whatever might be the cost to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) own feelings.
As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) love for Hetta, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) old hopes, and the disappointment
which had so nearly unmanned him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) said not another word to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
fortunate rival. Montague knew it all, but there was now no necessity
that any allusion should be made to past misfortunes. Roger indeed
made a solemn resolution that to Paul he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) would never again speak of
Hetta as the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) himself had loved, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) looked forward
to a time, probably many years hence, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) might perhaps remind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) fidelity. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) spoke much of the land and of the tenants
and the labourers, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roger</b></font>) own farm, of the amount of the income, and
of the necessity of so living that the income might always be more
than sufficient for the wants of the household.

<p/>When the spring came round, Hetta and Paul were married by the Bishop
at the parish church of Carbury, and Roger Carbury gave away the
bride. All those who saw the ceremony declared that the squire had
not seemed to be so happy for many a long year. John Crumb, who was
there with his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) wife,--himself now one of Roger's tenants, having
occupied the land which had become vacant by the death of old Daniel
Ruggles,--declared that the wedding was almost as good fun as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>)
own. <div class="bookquote">``John, what a fool you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>Ruby said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) spouse, when this
opinion was expressed with rather a loud voice. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I be,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said
John,--<div class="bookquote">``but not such a fool as to a' missed a having o' you.''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,
John; it was I was the fool then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruby/Ruby Ruggles/Ruggles</b></font>)</div>said Ruby. <div class="bookquote">``We'll see about that
when the bairn's born,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Crumb/John/Crumb</b></font>)</div>said John,--equally aloud. Then Ruby held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruby</b></font>) tongue. Mrs. Broune, and Mr. Broune, were also at Carbury,--thus
doing great honour to Mr. and Mrs. Paul Montague, and showing by
their presence that all family feuds were at an end. Sir Felix was
not there. Happily up to this time Mr. Septimus Blake had continued
to keep that gentleman as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) Protestant population in the
German town,--no doubt not without considerable trouble to himself.

<p/>1.F.

<p/>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

<div class="bookquote">``Defects,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

<p/>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the <div class="bookquote">``Right
of Replacement or Refund''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and -LRB-c-RRB- any Defect you cause.


<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For forty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>www.gutenberg.org

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
