<p/>DAISY MILLER: A STUDY

<p/>IN TWO PARTS

<p/>The text is that of the first American appearance in book form, 1879.





<p/>PART I


<p/>At the little town of Vevey, in Switzerland, there is a particularly
comfortable hotel. There are, indeed, many hotels, for the entertainment
of tourists is the business of the place, which, as many travelers will
remember, is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake--a lake that
it behooves every tourist to visit. The shore of the lake presents an
unbroken array of establishments of this order, of every category, from
the <div class="bookquote">``grand hotel''  (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div>of the newest fashion, with a chalk-white front, a
hundred balconies, and a dozen flags flying from its roof, to the little
Swiss pension of an elder day, with its name inscribed in German-looking
lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the
angle of the garden. One of the hotels at Vevey, however, is famous,
even classical, being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors
by an air both of luxury and of maturity. In this region, in the month
of June, American travelers are extremely numerous; it may be said,
indeed, that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics
of an American watering place. There are sights and sounds which evoke a
vision, an echo, of Newport and Saratoga. There is a flitting hither
and thither of <div class="bookquote">``stylish''  (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div>young girls, a rustling of muslin flounces,
a rattle of dance music in the morning hours, a sound of high-pitched
voices at all times. You receive an impression of these things at the
excellent inn of the <div class="bookquote">``Trois Couronnes''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and are transported in fancy to
the Ocean House or to Congress Hall. But at the <div class="bookquote">``Trois Couronnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>waiters</b></font>)</div>it
must be added, there are other features that are much at variance with
these suggestions: neat German waiters, who look like secretaries of
legation; Russian princesses sitting in the garden; little Polish boys
walking about held by the hand, with their governors; a view of the
sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle
of Chillon.

<p/>I hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were
uppermost in the mind of a young American, who, two or three years ago,
sat in the garden of the <div class="bookquote">``Trois Couronnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>a American</b></font>)</div>looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>), rather
idly, at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned. It was a
beautiful summer morning, and in whatever fashion the young American
looked at things, they must have seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) charming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) had come
from Geneva the day before by the little steamer, to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) aunt, who
was staying at the hotel--Geneva having been for a long time his (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) place
of residence. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) aunt had a headache--his (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) aunt had almost always a
headache--and now she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was shut up in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) room, smelling camphor, so that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) was at liberty to wander about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) was some seven-and-twenty years
of age; when his (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) friends spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>), they usually said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) was at
Geneva <div class="bookquote">``studying.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) enemies spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>), they said--but,
after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) had no enemies; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) was an extremely amiable fellow, and
universally liked. What I should say is, simply, that when certain
persons spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) they affirmed that the reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) spending so
much time at Geneva was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) was extremely devoted to a lady who
lived there--a foreign lady--a person older than himself. Very few
Americans--indeed, I think none--had ever seen this lady, about whom
there were some singular stories. But Winterbourne had an old attachment
for the little metropolis of Calvinism; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had been put to school there
as a boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had afterward gone to college there--circumstances
which had led to his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) forming a great many youthful friendships. Many of
these he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had kept, and they were a source of great satisfaction to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>).

<p/>After knocking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt's door and learning that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was indisposed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had taken a walk about the town, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had come in to his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
breakfast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had now finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) breakfast; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was drinking a
small cup of coffee, which had been served to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) on a little table in
the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache. At last
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) coffee and lit a cigarette. Presently a small boy came
walking along the path--an urchin of nine or ten. The child, who was
diminutive for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) years, had an aged expression of countenance, a pale
complexion, and sharp little features. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was dressed in knickerbockers,
with red stockings, which displayed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) poor little spindle-shanks;
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) also wore a brilliant red cravat. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand a long
alpenstock, the sharp point of which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thrust into everything that
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) approached--the flowerbeds, the garden benches, the trains of the
ladies' dresses. In front of Winterbourne he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) paused, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) with
a pair of bright, penetrating little eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you give me a lump of sugar?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) asked in a sharp, hard little
voice--a voice immature and yet, somehow, not young.

<p/>Winterbourne glanced at the small table near him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) coffee
service rested, and saw that several morsels of sugar remained. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
you may take one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``but I don't think sugar is good for
little boys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of
the coveted fragments, two of which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) buried in the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
knickerbockers, depositing the other as promptly in another place. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
poked his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) alpenstock, lance-fashion, into Winterbourne's bench and tried
to crack the lump of sugar with his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) teeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, blazes; it's har-r-d!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) exclaimed, pronouncing the adjective in a
peculiar manner.

<p/>Winterbourne had immediately perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) might have the honor
of claiming him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) as a fellow countryman. <div class="bookquote">``Take care you don't hurt your
teeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said, paternally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't got any teeth to hurt. They have all come out. I have only
got seven teeth. My mother counted them last night, and one came out
right afterward. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d slap me if any more came out. I can't
help it. It's this old Europe. It's the climate that makes them come
out. In America they didn't come out. It's these hotels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne was much amused. <div class="bookquote">``If you eat three lumps of sugar, your
mother will certainly slap you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s got to give me some candy, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>interlocutor</b></font>)</div>rejoined his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) young
interlocutor. <div class="bookquote">``I can't get any candy here--any American candy. American
candy's the best candy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are American little boys the best little boys?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>asked Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I'm an American boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you are one of the best!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>laughed Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you an American man?''  (<font color='red'><b>this infant</b></font>)</div>pursued this vivacious infant. And then,
on Winterbourne's affirmative reply--<div class="bookquote">``American men are the best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
declared.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) companion thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) for the compliment, and the child, who had
now got astride of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) alpenstock, stood looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
attacked a second lump of sugar. Winterbourne wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) himself
had been like this in his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) infancy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had been brought to Europe at
about this age.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes my sister!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>cried the child in a moment. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s an American
girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady
advancing. <div class="bookquote">``American girls are the best girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said cheerfully to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) young companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister ain't the best!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child declared. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s always blowing at
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine that is your fault, not hers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne. The young
lady meanwhile had drawn near. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was dressed in white muslin, with a
hundred frills and flounces, and knots of pale-colored ribbon. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
bareheaded, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) balanced in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand a large parasol, with a deep
border of embroidery; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was strikingly, admirably pretty. <div class="bookquote">``How
pretty they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>thought Winterbourne, straightening himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
seat, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) were prepared to rise.

<p/>The young lady paused in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) bench, near the parapet of the
garden, which overlooked the lake. The little boy had now converted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
alpenstock into a vaulting pole, by the aid of which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was springing
about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Randolph,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady, <div class="bookquote">``what ARE you doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going up the Alps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>replied Randolph. <div class="bookquote">``This is the way!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)
gave another little jump, scattering the pebbles about Winterbourne's
ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the way they come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)'s an American man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>cried Randolph, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) little hard voice.

<p/>The young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight
at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess you had better be quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) simply
observed.

<p/>It seemed to Winterbourne that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had been in a manner presented. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``This little boy and I have made acquaintance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said, with
great civility. In Geneva, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had been perfectly aware, a young
man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under
certain rarely occurring conditions; but here at Vevey, what conditions
could be better than these?--a pretty American girl coming and standing
in front of you in a garden. This pretty American girl, however, on
hearing Winterbourne's observation, simply glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) then
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the
opposite mountains. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had gone too far, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) must advance farther, rather than retreat. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was
thinking of something else to say, the young lady turned to the little
boy again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to know where you got that pole,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I bought it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>responded Randolph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say you're going to take it to Italy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am going to take it to Italy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child declared.

<p/>The young girl glanced over the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dress and smoothed out a
knot or two of ribbon. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes upon the prospect again.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess you had better leave it somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said after a
moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to Italy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great
respect.

<p/>The young lady glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) replied. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
said nothing more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you--a--going over the Simplon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne pursued, a little
embarrassed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's some mountain. Randolph, what
mountain are we going over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going where?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Italy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>said Randolph. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go to Italy. I want to
go to America.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Italy is a beautiful place!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>rejoined the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you get candy there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>Randolph loudly inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``I guess you have had enough candy, and
mother thinks so too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't had any for ever so long--for a hundred weeks!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the
boy, still jumping about.

<p/>The young lady inspected her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) flounces and smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ribbons again;
and Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the
view. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was ceasing to be embarrassed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had begun to perceive
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not in the least embarrassed herself. There had not been
the slightest alteration in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) charming complexion; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was evidently
neither offended nor flattered. If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked another way when he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) spoke
to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and seemed not particularly to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), this was simply her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
habit, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manner. Yet, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) talked a little more and pointed out some
of the objects of interest in the view, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared quite
unacquainted, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gradually gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) more of the benefit of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glance;
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking.
It was not, however, what would have been called an immodest glance,
for the young girl's eyes were singularly honest and fresh. They were
wonderfully pretty eyes; and, indeed, Winterbourne had not seen for
a long time anything prettier than his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) fair countrywoman's various
features--her (<font color='blue'><b>countrywoman</b></font>) complexion, her (<font color='blue'><b>countrywoman</b></font>) nose, her (<font color='blue'><b>countrywoman</b></font>) ears, her (<font color='blue'><b>countrywoman</b></font>) teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had a great
relish for feminine beauty; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was addicted to observing and analyzing
it; and as regards this young lady's face he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) made several observations.
It was not at all insipid, but it was not exactly expressive; and
though it was eminently delicate, Winterbourne mentally accused it--very
forgivingly--of a want of finish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) thought it very possible that
Master Randolph's sister was a coquette; he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had a spirit of
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own; but in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bright, sweet, superficial little visage there was
no mockery, no irony. Before long it became obvious that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was much
disposed toward conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) that they were going to Rome
for the winter--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother and Randolph. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) was
a <div class="bookquote">``real American'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shouldn't have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) for one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) seemed more
like a German--this was said after a little hesitation--especially when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) spoke. Winterbourne, laughing, answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had met Germans who
spoke like Americans, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had not, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) remembered, met
an American who spoke like a German. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should not
be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had just quitted.
She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) liked standing up and walking about; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
presently sat down. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was from New York State--<div class="bookquote">``if you
know where that is.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne learned more about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) by catching
hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) small, slippery brother and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) stand a few minutes
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me your name, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Randolph C. Miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy sharply. <div class="bookquote">``And I'll tell you her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
name;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) leveled his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) alpenstock at his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better wait till you are asked!''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>said this young lady calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like very much to know your name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) name is Daisy Miller!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>cried the child. <div class="bookquote">``But that isn't her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) real
name; that isn't her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) name on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity you haven't got one of my cards!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miss Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) real name is Annie P. Miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister, indicating Winterbourne.

<p/>But on this point Randolph seemed perfectly indifferent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) continued to
supply information with regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) own family. <div class="bookquote">``My father's name is
Ezra B. Miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) announced. <div class="bookquote">``My father ain't in Europe; my father's
in a better place than Europe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the
child had been taught to intimate that Mr. Miller had been removed to
the sphere of celestial reward. But Randolph immediately added, <div class="bookquote">``My
father's in Schenectady. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s got a big business. My father's rich, you
bet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Miss Miller, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) parasol and looking at
the embroidered border. Winterbourne presently released the child,
who departed, dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) alpenstock along the path. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't like
Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the young girl. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants to go back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Schenectady, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants to go right home. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hasn't got any boys here. There is
one boy here, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) always goes round with a teacher; they won't let
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And your brother hasn't any teacher?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother thought of getting him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) one, to travel round with us. There was a
lady told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of a very good teacher; an American lady--perhaps you know
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--Mrs. Sanders. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came from Boston. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of this
teacher, and we thought of getting him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to travel round with us. But
Randolph said he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) didn't want a teacher traveling round with us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) wouldn't have lessons when he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) was in the cars. And we ARE in the cars
about half the time. There was an English lady we met in the cars--I
think her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name was Miss Featherstone; perhaps you know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wanted
to know why I didn't give Randolph lessons--give him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) `instruction,' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
called it. I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) could give me more instruction than I could give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)'s very smart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) seems very smart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother's going to get a teacher for him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) as soon as we get to Italy. Can
you get good teachers in Italy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or else she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s going to find some school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) ought to learn some more.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)'s only nine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)'s going to college.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>And in this way Miss Miller
continued to converse upon the affairs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) family and upon other
topics. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) sat there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) extremely pretty hands, ornamented with
very brilliant rings, folded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) lap, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) pretty eyes now
resting upon those of Winterbourne, now wandering over the garden, the
people who passed by, and the beautiful view. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) talked to Winterbourne
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) a long time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) found it very pleasant. It was
many years since he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had heard a young girl talk so much. It might have
been said of this unknown young lady, who had come and sat down beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) upon a bench, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chattered. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very quiet; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat in a
charming, tranquil attitude; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes were constantly
moving. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a soft, slender, agreeable voice, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tone was
decidedly sociable. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave Winterbourne a history of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) movements
and intentions and those of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother and brother, in Europe, and
enumerated, in particular, the various hotels at which they had stopped.
<div class="bookquote">``That English lady in the cars,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``Miss Featherstone--asked me
if we didn't all live in hotels in America. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) I had never been
in so many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe. I have never
seen so many--it's nothing but hotels.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But Miss Miller did not make
this remark with a querulous accent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) appeared to be in the best
humor with everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) declared that the hotels were very good, when
once you got used to their ways, and that Europe was perfectly sweet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was not disappointed--not a bit. Perhaps it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had
heard so much about it before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had ever so many intimate friends
that had been there ever so many times. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had had ever so
many dresses and things from Paris. Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) put on a Paris dress
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) were in Europe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a kind of a wishing cap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miss Miller without examining this analogy; <div class="bookquote">``it always made
me wish I was here. But I needn't have done that for dresses. I am sure
they send all the pretty ones to America; you see the most frightful
things here. The only thing I don't like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) proceeded, <div class="bookquote">``is the
society. There isn't any society; or, if there is, I don't know where it
keeps itself. Do you? I suppose there is some society somewhere, but I
haven't seen anything of it. I'm very fond of society, and I have always
had a great deal of it. I don't mean only in Schenectady, but in New
York. I used to go to New York every winter. In New York I had lots of
society. Last winter I had seventeen dinners given me; and three of them
were by gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added Daisy Miller. <div class="bookquote">``I have more friends in New York
than in Schenectady--more gentleman friends; and more young lady friends
too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) resumed in a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) paused again for an instant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was
looking at Winterbourne with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) prettiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) lively eyes and
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) light, slightly monotonous smile. <div class="bookquote">``I have always had,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``a great deal of gentlemen's society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion;
never, at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of
demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment. And yet was he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
to accuse Miss Daisy Miller of actual or potential inconduite, as they
said at Geneva? He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had lived at Geneva so long that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
had lost a good deal; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had become dishabituated to the American tone.
Never, indeed, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had grown old enough to appreciate things, had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this.
Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very charming, but how deucedly sociable! Was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
simply a pretty girl from New York State? Were they all like that, the
pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen's society? Or was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) also
a designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person? Winterbourne
had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) instinct in this matter, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) reason could not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>).
Miss Daisy Miller looked extremely innocent. Some people had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
that, after all, American girls were exceedingly innocent; and others
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) that, after all, they were not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was inclined to think
Miss Daisy Miller was a flirt--a pretty American flirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had never, as
yet, had any relations with young ladies of this category. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had
known, here in Europe, two or three women--persons older than Miss Daisy
Miller, and provided, for respectability's sake, with husbands--who were
great coquettes--dangerous, terrible women, with whom one's relations
were liable to take a serious turn. But this young girl was not a
coquette in that sense; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very unsophisticated; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was only a
pretty American flirt. Winterbourne was almost grateful for having found
the formula that applied to Miss Daisy Miller. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
seat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) remarked to himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had the most charming nose he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had
ever seen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations
of one's intercourse with a pretty American flirt. It presently became
apparent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was on the way to learn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been to that old castle?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the young girl, pointing with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, formerly, more than once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``You too, I suppose,
have seen it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; we haven't been there. I want to go there dreadfully. Of course I
mean to go there. I wouldn't go away from here without having seen that
old castle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very pretty excursion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``and very easy to
make. You can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go in the cars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miss Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you can go in the cars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne assented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our courier says they take you right up to the castle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl
continued. <div class="bookquote">``We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suffers
dreadfully from dyspepsia. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) couldn't go. Randolph wouldn't
go either; he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) doesn't think much of old castles. But I guess
we'll go this week, if we can get Randolph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne
inquired, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) don't care much about old castles. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s only nine. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
wants to stay at the hotel. Mother's afraid to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) alone, and the
courier won't stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>); so we haven't been to many places. But it
will be too bad if we don't go up there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>And Miss Miller pointed again
at the Chateau de Chillon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it might be arranged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you
get some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Miller looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) a moment, and then, very placidly, <div class="bookquote">``I wish YOU
would stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said.

<p/>Winterbourne hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I should much rather go to Chillon
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the young girl with the same placidity.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) didn't rise, blushing, as a young girl at Geneva would have done;
and yet Winterbourne, conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had been very bold, thought
it possible she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was offended. <div class="bookquote">``With your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) answered very
respectfully.

<p/>But it seemed that both his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) audacity and his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) respect were lost upon Miss
Daisy Miller. <div class="bookquote">``I guess my mother won't go, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
don't like to ride round in the afternoon. But did you really mean what
you said just now--that you would like to go up there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most earnestly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we may arrange it. If mother will stay with Randolph, I guess
Eugenio will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eugenio?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eugenio's our courier. He (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) doesn't like to stay with Randolph; he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)'s the
most fastidious man I ever saw. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)'s a splendid courier. I guess
he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)'ll stay at home with Randolph if mother does, and then we can go to
the castle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible--<div class="bookquote">``we''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>could
only mean Miss Daisy Miller and himself. This program seemed almost too
agreeable for credence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) ought to kiss the young lady's
hand. Possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but
at this moment another person, presumably Eugenio, appeared. A tall,
handsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and
a brilliant watch chain, approached Miss Miller, looking sharply at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
companion. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Eugenio!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miss Miller with the friendliest accent.

<p/>Eugenio had looked at Winterbourne from head to foot; he (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenio</b></font>) now bowed
gravely to the young lady. <div class="bookquote">``I have the honor to inform mademoiselle that
luncheon is upon the table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Miller slowly rose. <div class="bookquote">``See here, Eugenio!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to
that old castle, anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Chateau de Chillon, mademoiselle?''  (<font color='red'><b>the courier</b></font>)</div>the courier inquired.
<div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle has made arrangements?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) added in a tone which struck
Winterbourne as very impertinent.

<p/>Eugenio's tone apparently threw, even to Miss Miller's own apprehension,
a slightly ironical light upon the young girl's situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) turned
to Winterbourne, blushing a little--a very little. <div class="bookquote">``You won't back out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not be happy till we go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are staying in this hotel?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``And you are really an
American?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The courier</b></font>)</div><p/>The courier stood looking at Winterbourne offensively. The young man,
at least, thought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner of looking an offense to Miss Miller; it
conveyed an imputation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``picked up''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>acquaintances. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have
the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, smiling and referring to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, we'll go some day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Miss Miller. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a
smile and turned away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) parasol and walked back to the inn
beside Eugenio. Winterbourne stood looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>); and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) moved
away, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) muslin furbelows over the gravel, said to himself that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had the tournure of a princess.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had, however, engaged to do more than proved feasible, in promising
to present his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt, Mrs. Costello, to Miss Daisy Miller. As soon as the
former lady had got better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) headache, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) waited upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
apartment; and, after the proper inquiries in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) health, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had observed in the hotel an American family--a mamma,
a daughter, and a little boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And a courier?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Costello. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I have observed them. Seen
them--heard them--and kept out of their way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Costello was a widow
with a fortune; a person of much distinction, who frequently intimated
that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches, she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) would
probably have left a deeper impress upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) had a long, pale
face, a high nose, and a great deal of very striking white hair, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) had
two sons married in New York and another who was now in Europe. This
young man was amusing himself at Hamburg, and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
travels, was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment
selected by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own appearance there. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nephew, who had
come up to Vevey expressly to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), was therefore more attentive than
those who, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, were nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had imbibed at Geneva the
idea that one must always be attentive to one's aunt. Mrs. Costello
had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) for many years, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) was greatly pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>),
manifesting her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) approbation by initiating him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) into many of the secrets
of that social sway which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) to understand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) exerted in
the American capital. She (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) admitted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) was very exclusive; but, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) were acquainted with New York, he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) would see that one had to be. And
her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of
that city, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) in many different lights, was, to
Winterbourne's imagination, almost oppressively striking.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) immediately perceived, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) tone, that Miss Daisy Miller's place
in the social scale was low. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you don't approve of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are very common,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Costello declared. <div class="bookquote">``They are the sort of
Americans that one does one's duty by not--not accepting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you don't accept them?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't, my dear Frederick. I would if I could, but I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The young girl is very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s pretty. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is very common.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see what you mean, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne after another pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has that charming look that they all have,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt resumed. <div class="bookquote">``I
can't think where they pick it up; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dresses in perfection--no,
you don't know how well she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dresses. I can't think where they get their
taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear aunt, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is not, after all, a Comanche savage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is a young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Costello, <div class="bookquote">``who has an intimacy with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
mamma's courier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An intimacy with the courier?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the mother is just as bad! They treat the courier like a familiar
friend--like a gentleman. I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dines with them.
Very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners, such
fine clothes, so like a gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) probably corresponds to the young

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures; they helped
him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) mind about Miss Daisy. Evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was rather wild.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am not a courier, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very charming to

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We simply met in the garden, and we talked a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tout bonnement! And pray what did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I should take the liberty of introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to my admirable

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was to guarantee my respectability,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray who is to guarantee hers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are cruel!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s a very nice young girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say that as if you believed it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Costello observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is completely uncultivated,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne went on. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is
wonderfully pretty, and, in short, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is very nice. To prove that I
believe it, I am going to take her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to the Chateau de Chillon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You two are going off there together? I should say it proved just the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) half an hour!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Costello. <div class="bookquote">``What a dreadful girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>nephew</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) nephew was silent for some moments. <div class="bookquote">``You really think, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
began earnestly, and with a desire for trustworthy information--<div class="bookquote">``you
really think that--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) paused again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think what, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is the sort of young lady who expects a man, sooner or later,
to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do. But
I really think that you had better not meddle with little American girls

innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear aunt, I am not so innocent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, smiling and
curling his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) mustache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are guilty too, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne continued to curl his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) mustache meditatively. <div class="bookquote">``You won't let
the poor girl know you then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) asked at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it literally true that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is going to the Chateau de Chillon with
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fully intends it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, my dear Frederick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Costello, <div class="bookquote">``I must decline the honor
of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) acquaintance. I am an old woman, but I am not too old, thank
Heaven, to be shocked!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't they all do these things--the young girls in America?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne inquired.

<p/>Mrs. Costello stared a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to see my granddaughters
do them!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) declared grimly.

<p/>This seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for Winterbourne
remembered to have heard that his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) pretty cousins in New York were
<div class="bookquote">``tremendous flirts.''  (<font color='red'><b>cousins</b></font>)</div>If, therefore, Miss Daisy Miller exceeded the
liberal margin allowed to these young ladies, it was probable that
anything might be expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>). Winterbourne was impatient to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was vexed with himself that, by instinct, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) should not
appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) justly.

<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was impatient to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) hardly knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) should say
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt's refusal to become acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
discovered, promptly enough, that with Miss Daisy Miller there was
no great need of walking on tiptoe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) that evening in the
garden, wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph,
and swinging to and fro the largest fan he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) had ever beheld. It was ten
o’clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) had dined with his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) aunt, had been sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) since
dinner, and had just taken leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) till the morrow. Miss Daisy
Miller seemed very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) declared it was the longest
evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had ever passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been all alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been walking round with mother. But mother gets tired walking
round,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gone to bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't like to go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the young girl. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't
sleep--not three hours. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't know how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lives. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s
dreadfully nervous. I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sleeps more than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thinks. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s gone
somewhere after Randolph; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wants to try to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) to go to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)
doesn't like to go to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hope she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>observed Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) all she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) doesn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to talk
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Miss Daisy, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) fan. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s going to try to get
Eugenio to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenio</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenio</b></font>) isn't afraid of Eugenio. Eugenio's a
splendid courier, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenio</b></font>) can't make much impression on Randolph! I don't
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>)'ll go to bed before eleven.''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>It appeared that Randolph's
vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged, for Winterbourne strolled
about with the young girl for some time without meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``I
have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
companion resumed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s your aunt.''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Then, on Winterbourne's admitting
the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had learned it, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had heard all about Mrs. Costello from the chambermaid. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
very quiet and very comme il faut; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore white puffs; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke to no
one, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never dined at the table d’hote. Every two days she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a
headache. <div class="bookquote">``I think that's a lovely description, headache and all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Daisy</b></font>)</div>said
Miss Daisy, chattering along in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) thin, gay voice. <div class="bookquote">``I want to know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
ever so much. I know just what YOUR aunt would be; I know I should like
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would be very exclusive. I like a lady to be exclusive; I'm
dying to be exclusive myself. Well, we ARE exclusive, mother and I. We
don't speak to everyone--or they don't speak to us. I suppose it's about
the same thing. Anyway, I shall be ever so glad to know your aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne was embarrassed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would be most happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but I
am afraid those headaches will interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The young girl looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) through the dusk. <div class="bookquote">``But I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
doesn't have a headache every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said sympathetically.

<p/>Winterbourne was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) answered
at last, not knowing what to say.

<p/>Miss Daisy Miller stopped and stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) prettiness was
still visible in the darkness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was opening and closing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) enormous
fan. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) doesn't want to know me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you
say so? You needn't be afraid. I'm not afraid!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) gave a little
laugh.

<p/>Winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) voice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was touched,
shocked, mortified by it. <div class="bookquote">``My dear young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) protested, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows
no one. It's her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wretched health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The young girl walked on a few steps, laughing still. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't be
afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) want to know me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) paused
again; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was close to the parapet of the garden, and in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was the starlit lake. There was a vague sheen upon its surface, and in
the distance were dimly seen mountain forms. Daisy Miller looked out
upon the mysterious prospect and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) gave another little laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``Gracious! she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) IS exclusive!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said. Winterbourne wondered whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was seriously wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) sense
of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) to attempt to
reassure and comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had a pleasant sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) would be very
approachable for consolatory purposes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) felt then, for the instant,
quite ready to sacrifice his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt, conversationally; to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
was a proud, rude woman, and to declare that they needn't mind her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).
But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture
of gallantry and impiety, the young lady, resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) walk, gave an
exclamation in quite another tone. <div class="bookquote">``Well, here's Mother! I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
hasn't got Randolph to go to bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>The figure of a lady appeared at a
distance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and
wavering movement. Suddenly it seemed to pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure it is your mother? Can you distinguish her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in this thick
dusk?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Daisy Miller with a laugh; <div class="bookquote">``I guess I know my own
mother. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has got on my shawl, too! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is always wearing my
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot
at which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had checked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid your mother doesn't see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.
<div class="bookquote">``Or perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) added, thinking, with Miss Miller, the joke
permissible--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feels guilty about your shawl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's a fearful old thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl replied serenely. <div class="bookquote">``I told
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could wear it. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) won't come here because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sees you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``I had better leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>urged Miss Daisy Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid your mother doesn't approve of my walking with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Miller gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) a serious glance. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't for me; it's for
you--that is, it's for HER. Well, I don't know who it's for! But mother
doesn't like any of my gentlemen friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s right down timid. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
always makes a fuss if I introduce a gentleman. But I DO introduce
them--almost always. If I didn't introduce my gentlemen friends to
Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl added in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) little soft, flat monotone, <div class="bookquote">``I
shouldn't think I was natural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To introduce me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``you must know my name.''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
proceeded to pronounce it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, I can't say all that!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) companion with a laugh. But
by this time they had come up to Mrs. Miller, who, as they drew near,
walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it, looking intently
at the lake and turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) back to them. <div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the young
girl in a tone of decision. Upon this the elder lady turned round. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Winterbourne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Miss Daisy Miller, introducing the young man very
frankly and prettily. <div class="bookquote">``Common,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was, as Mrs. Costello had pronounced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>); yet it was a wonder to Winterbourne that, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) commonness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>)
had a singularly delicate grace.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) mother was a small, spare, light person, with a wandering eye,
a very exiguous nose, and a large forehead, decorated with a certain
amount of thin, much frizzled hair. Like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter, Mrs. Miller was
dressed with extreme elegance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had enormous diamonds in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) ears.
So far as Winterbourne could observe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) no greeting--she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
certainly was not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>). Daisy was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>), pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) shawl
straight. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing, poking round here?''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>this young lady
inquired, but by no means with that harshness of accent which her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) choice
of words may imply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mother, turning toward the lake again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think you'd want that shawl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mother answered with a little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you get Randolph to go to bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the young girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I couldn't induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Miller very gently. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) wants to
talk to the waiter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) likes to talk to that waiter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was telling Mr. Winterbourne,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl went on; and to the
young man's ear her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) tone might have indicated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had been uttering
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name all her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne; <div class="bookquote">``I have the pleasure of knowing your son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Randolph's mamma was silent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) attention to the lake. But
at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't see how he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lives!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyhow, it isn't so bad as it was at Dover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what occurred at Dover?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wouldn't go to bed at all. I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sat up all night in the public
parlor. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wasn't in bed at twelve o’clock: I know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was half-past twelve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>declared Mrs. Miller with mild emphasis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sleep much during the day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) doesn't sleep much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy rejoined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``It seems as if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) couldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s real tiresome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy pursued.

<p/>Then, for some moments, there was silence. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Daisy Miller,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said
the elder lady, presently, <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think you'd want to talk against
your own brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) IS tiresome, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy, quite without the asperity
of a retort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s only nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>urged Mrs. Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wouldn't go to that castle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the young girl. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going
there with Mr. Winterbourne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>To this announcement, very placidly made, Daisy's mamma offered no
response. Winterbourne took for granted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) deeply disapproved of
the projected excursion; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said to himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was a simple,
easily managed person, and that a few deferential protestations would
take the edge from her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) displeasure. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) began; <div class="bookquote">``your daughter has
kindly allowed me the honor of being her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) guide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Miller's wandering eyes attached themselves, with a sort of
appealing air, to Daisy, who, however, strolled a few steps farther,
gently humming to herself. <div class="bookquote">``I presume you will go in the cars,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, or in the boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of course, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Miller rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``I have never
been to that castle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity you shouldn't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, beginning to feel
reassured as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) opposition. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was quite prepared to find
that, as a matter of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) meant to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've been thinking ever so much about going,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) pursued; <div class="bookquote">``but it
seems as if we couldn't. Of course Daisy--she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) wants to go round. But
there's a lady here--I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shouldn't think
we'd want to go to see castles HERE; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should think we'd want to wait
till we got to Italy. It seems as if there would be so many there,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Miller with an air of increasing confidence. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
we only want to see the principal ones. We visited several in England,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) presently added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah yes! in England there are beautiful castles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.
<div class="bookquote">``But Chillon here, is very well worth seeing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if Daisy feels up to it--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Miller, in a tone
impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise. <div class="bookquote">``It seems
as if there was nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) wouldn't undertake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)'ll enjoy it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne declared. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) desired
more and more to make it a certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was to have the privilege
of a tete-a-tete with the young lady, who was still strolling along
in front of them, softly vocalizing. <div class="bookquote">``You are not disposed, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
inquired, <div class="bookquote">``to undertake it yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy's mother looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) an instant askance, and then walked forward
in silence. Then--<div class="bookquote">``I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) had better go alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said simply.
Winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of
maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the
forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of
the lake. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) meditations were interrupted by hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) name very
distinctly pronounced by Mrs. Miller's unprotected daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Winterbourne!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>murmured Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you want to take me out in a boat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At present?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Annie Miller!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>exclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you, madam, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne ardently; for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer
starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)'d want to,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``I should think
she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)'d rather go indoors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure Mr. Winterbourne wants to take me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy declared. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)'s so
awfully devoted!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will row you over to Chillon in the starlight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the elder lady again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't spoken to me for half an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) daughter went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I want you to take me out in a boat!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy repeated. They had
all stopped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had turned round and was looking at Winterbourne.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) face wore a charming smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) pretty eyes were gleaming, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was
swinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) great fan about. No; it's impossible to be prettier than
that, thought Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said,
pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake.
<div class="bookquote">``If you will do me the honor to accept my arm, we will go and select one
of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy stood there smiling; she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) head and gave a little,
light laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I like a gentleman to be formal!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you it's a formal offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was bound I would make you say something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, it's not very difficult,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``But I am afraid
you are chaffing me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>remarked Mrs. Miller very gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do, then, let me give you a row,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said to the young girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's quite lovely, the way you say that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>cried Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be still more lovely to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it would be lovely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) made no movement to
accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) only stood there laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think you had better find out what time it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>interposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is eleven o’clock, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said a voice, with a foreign accent, out
of the neighboring darkness; and Winterbourne, turning, perceived the
florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had
apparently just approached.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Eugenio,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy, <div class="bookquote">``I am going out in a boat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Eugenio bowed. <div class="bookquote">``At eleven o’clock, mademoiselle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going with Mr. Winterbourne--this very minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do tell her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Miller to the courier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you had better not go out in a boat, mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenio</b></font>)</div>Eugenio
declared.

<p/>Winterbourne wished to Heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) courier; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you don't think it's proper!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Eugenio
doesn't think anything's proper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am at your service,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does mademoiselle propose to go alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugenio</b></font>)</div>asked Eugenio of Mrs. Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; with this gentleman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>answered Daisy's mamma.

<p/>The courier looked for a moment at Winterbourne--the latter thought he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>)
was smiling--and then, solemnly, with a bow, <div class="bookquote">``As mademoiselle pleases!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I hoped you would make a fuss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care to go
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I myself shall make a fuss if you don't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all I want--a little fuss!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>And the young girl began to laugh
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Randolph has gone to bed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the courier</b></font>)</div>the courier announced frigidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Daisy; now we can go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Miller.

<p/>Daisy turned away from Winterbourne, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), smiling and fanning
herself. <div class="bookquote">``Good night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I hope you are disappointed, or
disgusted, or something!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>), taking the hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am puzzled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope it won't keep you awake!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said very smartly; and,
under the escort of the privileged Eugenio, the two ladies passed toward
the house.

<p/>Winterbourne stood looking after them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was indeed puzzled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour, turning over the
mystery of the young girl's sudden familiarities and caprices. But
the only very definite conclusion he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) came to was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) should enjoy
deucedly <div class="bookquote">``going off''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) somewhere.

<p/>Two days afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) went off with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the Castle of Chillon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the large hall of the hotel, where the couriers, the
servants, the foreign tourists, were lounging about and staring. It was
not the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) should have chosen, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had appointed it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came
tripping downstairs, buttoning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) long gloves, squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) folded
parasol against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pretty figure, dressed in the perfection of a
soberly elegant traveling costume. Winterbourne was a man of imagination
and, as our ancestors used to say, sensibility; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
dress and, on the great staircase, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little rapid, confiding step, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
felt as if there were something romantic going forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) could have
believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was going to elope with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) passed out with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) among
all the idle people that were assembled there; they were all looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very hard; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had begun to chatter as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>).
Winterbourne's preference had been that they should be conveyed to
Chillon in a carriage; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expressed a lively wish to go in the
little steamer; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a passion for steamboats.
There was always such a lovely breeze upon the water, and you saw such
lots of people. The sail was not long, but Winterbourne's companion
found time to say a great many things. To the young man himself their
little excursion was so much of an escapade--an adventure--that, even
allowing for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) habitual sense of freedom, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some expectation of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) regard it in the same way. But it must be confessed that,
in this particular, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was disappointed. Daisy Miller was extremely
animated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was in charming spirits; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was apparently not at all
excited; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was not fluttered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) avoided neither his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes nor those
of anyone else; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) blushed neither when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nor when she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
felt that people were looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>). People continued to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
a great deal, and Winterbourne took much satisfaction in his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) pretty
companion's distinguished air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had been a little afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
would talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to move about
the boat a good deal. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) quite forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) fears; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) sat smiling,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) face, while, without moving from her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
delivered herself of a great number of original reflections. It was the
most charming garrulity he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had ever heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had assented to the idea
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``common'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; but was she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) so, after all, or was he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) simply
getting used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) commonness? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) conversation was chiefly of what
metaphysicians term the objective cast, but every now and then it took a
subjective turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What on EARTH are you so grave about?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) suddenly demanded, fixing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) agreeable eyes upon Winterbourne's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I grave?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I had an idea I was grinning from ear to ear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look as if you were taking me to a funeral. If that's a grin, your
ears are very near together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do, and I'll carry round your hat. It will pay the expenses of our
journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was better pleased in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>murmured Winterbourne.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) a moment and then burst into a little laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I like
to make you say those things! You're a queer mixture!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In the castle, after they had landed, the subjective element decidedly
prevailed. Daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers, rustled her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) skirts
in the corkscrew staircases, flirted back with a pretty little cry and
a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes, and turned a singularly
well-shaped ear to everything that Winterbourne told her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) about the
place. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) cared very little for feudal antiquities and
that the dusky traditions of Chillon made but a slight impression upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>). They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without
other companionship than that of the custodian; and Winterbourne
arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried--that
they should linger and pause wherever they chose. The custodian
interpreted the bargain generously--Winterbourne, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) side, had been
generous--and ended by leaving them quite to themselves. Miss Miller's
observations were not remarkable for logical consistency; for anything
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) wanted to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was sure to find a pretext. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) found a great many
pretexts in the rugged embrasures of Chillon for asking Winterbourne
sudden questions about himself--his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) family, his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) previous history, his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
tastes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) habits, his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) intentions--and for supplying information upon
corresponding points in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) own personality. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) own tastes, habits,
and intentions Miss Miller was prepared to give the most definite, and
indeed the most favorable account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope you know enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) companion, after he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) the history of the unhappy Bonivard. <div class="bookquote">``I never saw a man that
knew so much!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bonivard</b></font>)</div>The history of Bonivard had evidently, as they say, gone
into one ear and out of the other. But Daisy went on to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
wished Winterbourne would travel with them and <div class="bookquote">``go round''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>with them;
they might know something, in that case. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you want to come
and teach Randolph?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) asked. Winterbourne said that nothing
could possibly please him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) so much, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had unfortunately other
occupations. <div class="bookquote">``Other occupations? I don't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Miss Daisy.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you mean? You are not in business.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man admitted that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in business; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had engagements which, even within a day
or two, would force him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to go back to Geneva. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I
don't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) began to talk about something else. But a few
moments later, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was pointing out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) the pretty design of an
antique fireplace, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) broke out irrelevantly, <div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say
you are going back to Geneva?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a melancholy fact that I shall have to return to Geneva
tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Winterbourne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy, <div class="bookquote">``I think you're horrid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't say such dreadful things!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne--<div class="bookquote">``just at the
last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The last!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the young girl; <div class="bookquote">``I call it the first. I have half a
mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>And
for the next ten minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) did nothing but call him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) horrid. Poor
Winterbourne was fairly bewildered; no young lady had as yet done him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) movements. His (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
companion, after this, ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of
Chillon or the beauties of the lake; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) opened fire upon the mysterious
charmer in Geneva whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared to have instantly taken it for
granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>charmer</b></font>) was hurrying back to see. How did Miss Daisy Miller
know that there was a charmer in Geneva? Winterbourne, who denied the
existence of such a person, was quite unable to discover, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was
divided between amazement at the rapidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) induction and amusement
at the frankness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) persiflage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), in all this, an
extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity. <div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never allow
you more than three days at a time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>asked Daisy ironically. <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) give you a vacation in summer? There's no one so hard worked but
they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season. I suppose, if you
stay another day, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll come after you in the boat. Do wait over
till Friday, and I will go down to the landing to see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arrive!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne began to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had been wrong to feel disappointed in
the temper in which the young lady had embarked. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had missed the
personal accent, the personal accent was now making its appearance.
It sounded very distinctly, at last, in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would stop
<div class="bookquote">``teasing''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) would promise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) solemnly to come down to Rome in
the winter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not a difficult promise to make,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``My aunt
has taken an apartment in Rome for the winter and has already asked me
to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to come for your aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy; <div class="bookquote">``I want you to
come for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>And this was the only allusion that the young man was ever
to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) make to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) invidious kinswoman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared that, at
any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would certainly come. After this Daisy stopped teasing.
Winterbourne took a carriage, and they drove back to Vevey in the dusk;
the young girl was very quiet.

<p/>In the evening Winterbourne mentioned to Mrs. Costello that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had spent
the afternoon at Chillon with Miss Daisy Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Americans--of the courier?''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>asked this lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, happily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``the courier stayed at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) went with you all alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Costello sniffed a little at her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) smelling bottle. <div class="bookquote">``And that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>)
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``is the young person whom you wanted me to know!''





 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>PART II


<p/>Winterbourne, who had returned to Geneva the day after his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) excursion
to Chillon, went to Rome toward the end of January. His (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt had been
established there for several weeks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had received a couple of
letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Those people you were so devoted to last summer at
Vevey have turned up here, courier and all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wrote. <div class="bookquote">``They seem to
have made several acquaintances, but the courier continues to be the
most intime. The young lady, however, is also very intimate with some
third-rate Italians, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rackets about in a way that makes
much talk. Bring me that pretty novel of Cherbuliez's--Paule Mere--and
don't come later than the 23rd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>In the natural course of events, Winterbourne, on arriving in Rome,
would presently have ascertained Mrs. Miller's address at the American
banker's and have gone to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) compliments to Miss Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``After what
happened at Vevey, I think I may certainly call upon them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said to
Mrs. Costello.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If, after what happens--at Vevey and everywhere--you desire to keep
up the acquaintance, you are very welcome. Of course a man may know
everyone. Men are welcome to the privilege!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray what is it that happens--here, for instance?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne
demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The girl goes about alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) foreigners. As to what happens
further, you must apply elsewhere for information. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has picked up
half a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) takes them
about to people's houses. When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes to a party she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brings with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where is the mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least idea. They are very dreadful people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne meditated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``They are very ignorant--very innocent
only. Depend upon it they are not bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are hopelessly vulgar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Costello. <div class="bookquote">``Whether or no being
hopelessly vulgar is being `bad' is a question for the metaphysicians.
They are bad enough to dislike, at any rate; and for this short life
that is quite enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>The news that Daisy Miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful
mustaches checked Winterbourne's impulse to go straightway to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had, perhaps, not definitely flattered himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had made an
ineffaceable impression upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) heart, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was annoyed at hearing
of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately
flitted in and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) own meditations; the image of a very pretty
girl looking out of an old Roman window and asking herself urgently
when Mr. Winterbourne would arrive. If, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) determined to wait a
little before reminding Miss Miller of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) claims to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) consideration,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) went very soon to call upon two or three other friends. One of these
friends was an American lady who had spent several winters at Geneva,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) children at school. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a very accomplished
woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lived in the Via Gregoriana. Winterbourne found her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in a
little crimson drawing room on a third floor; the room was filled with
southern sunshine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had not been there ten minutes when the servant
came in, announcing <div class="bookquote">``Madame Mila!''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>This announcement was presently
followed by the entrance of little Randolph Miller, who stopped in the
middle of the room and stood staring at Winterbourne. An instant later
his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) pretty sister crossed the threshold; and then, after a considerable
interval, Mrs. Miller slowly advanced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>said Randolph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you know a great many things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Winterbourne, taking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) by the hand. <div class="bookquote">``How is your education coming on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) hostess, but when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) heard Winterbourne's voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) quickly turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I
declare!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you I should come, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne rejoined, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I didn't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Miss Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>laughed the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have come to see me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I arrived only yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl declared.

<p/>Winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mother, but this lady
evaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) glance, and, seating herself, fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) son.
<div class="bookquote">``We've got a bigger place than this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>said Randolph. <div class="bookquote">``It's all gold on
the walls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Miller turned uneasily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``I told you if I were to bring
you, you would say something!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told YOU!''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>Randolph exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I tell YOU, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) added jocosely,
giving Winterbourne a thump on the knee. <div class="bookquote">``It IS bigger, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) hostess;
Winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``I
hope you have been well since we parted at Vevey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said.

<p/>Mrs. Miller now certainly looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)--at his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) chin. <div class="bookquote">``Not very well,
sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'s got the dyspepsia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>said Randolph. <div class="bookquote">``I've got it too. Father's got
it. I've got it most!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>This announcement, instead of embarrassing Mrs. Miller, seemed to
relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suffer from the liver,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I think it's this
climate; it's less bracing than Schenectady, especially in the winter
season. I don't know whether you know we reside at Schenectady. I was
saying to Daisy that I certainly hadn't found any one like Dr. Davis,
and I didn't believe I should. Oh, at Schenectady he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) stands first; they
think everything of him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) has so much to do, and yet there was nothing
he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) wouldn't do for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) never saw anything like my dyspepsia,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) was bound to cure it. I'm sure there was nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) wouldn't
try. He (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) was just going to try something new when we came off. Mr. Miller
wanted Daisy to see Europe for herself. But I wrote to Mr. Miller that
it seems as if I couldn't get on without Dr. Davis. At Schenectady he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>)
stands at the very top; and there's a great deal of sickness there, too.
It affects my sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne had a good deal of pathological gossip with Dr. Davis's
patient, during which Daisy chattered unremittingly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) own
companion. The young man asked Mrs. Miller how she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was pleased with
Rome. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I must say I am disappointed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``We had heard
so much about it; I suppose we had heard too much. But we couldn't help
that. We had been led to expect something different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, wait a little, and you will become very fond of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said
Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate it worse and worse every day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>cried Randolph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are like the infant Hannibal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I ain't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>Randolph declared at a venture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not much like an infant,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``But we have seen
places,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) resumed, <div class="bookquote">``that I should put a long way before Rome.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in
reply to Winterbourne's interrogation, <div class="bookquote">``There's Zurich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) concluded,
<div class="bookquote">``I think Zurich is lovely; and we hadn't heard half so much about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The best place we've seen is the City of Richmond!''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>said Randolph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hannibal</b></font>) means the ship,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) mother explained. <div class="bookquote">``We crossed in that ship.
Randolph had a good time on the City of Richmond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the best place I've seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Only it was turned
the wrong way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we've got to turn the right way some time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Miller with
a little laugh. Winterbourne expressed the hope that her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) daughter at
least found some gratification in Rome, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) declared that Daisy
was quite carried away. <div class="bookquote">``It's on account of the society--the society's
splendid. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) goes round everywhere; she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) has made a great number of
acquaintances. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) goes round more than I do. I must say they
have been very sociable; they have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) right in. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
knows a great many gentlemen. Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) thinks there's nothing like Rome.
Of course, it's a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows
plenty of gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time Daisy had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) attention again to Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``I've
been telling Mrs. Walker how mean you were!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl announced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is the evidence you have offered?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>asked Winterbourne, rather
annoyed at Miss Miller's want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer
who on his (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) way down to Rome had stopped neither at Bologna nor at
Florence, simply because of a certain sentimental impatience. He (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>)
remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) that American
women--the pretty ones, and this gave a largeness to the axiom--were at
once the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense
of indebtedness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you were awfully mean at Vevey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't do
anything. You wouldn't stay there when I asked you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>cried Winterbourne, with eloquence, <div class="bookquote">``have I
come all the way to Rome to encounter your reproaches?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) say that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) hostess, giving a twist to a
bow on this lady's dress. <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever hear anything so quaint?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So quaint, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Walker in the tone of a partisan of
Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy, fingering Mrs. Walker's ribbons. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs.
Walker, I want to tell you something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother-r,''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>interposed Randolph, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) rough ends to his (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``I
tell you you've got to go. Eugenio'll raise--something!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of Eugenio,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy with a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Look
here, Mrs. Walker,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``you know I'm coming to your party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a lovely dress!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sure of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I want to ask a favor--permission to bring a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be happy to see any of your friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Walker, turning
with a smile to Mrs. Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they are not my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>answered Daisy's mamma, smiling shyly in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) own fashion. <div class="bookquote">``I never spoke to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an intimate friend of mine--Mr. Giovanelli,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy without
a tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) clear little voice or a shadow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) brilliant little
face.

<p/>Mrs. Walker was silent a moment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) gave a rapid glance at
Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad to see Mr. Giovanelli,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) then said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)'s an Italian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)'s a
great friend of mine; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)'s the handsomest man in the world--except Mr.
Winterbourne! He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) knows plenty of Italians, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) wants to know some
Americans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) thinks ever so much of Americans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)'s tremendously
clever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)'s perfectly lovely!''

 (<font color='red'><b>this personage</b></font>)</div><p/>It was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to Mrs.
Walker's party, and then Mrs. Miller prepared to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) leave. <div class="bookquote">``I
guess we'll go back to the hotel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may go back to the hotel, Mother, but I'm going to take a walk,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s going to walk with Mr. Giovanelli,''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>Randolph proclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to the Pincio,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alone, my dear--at this hour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Walker asked. The afternoon was
drawing to a close--it was the hour for the throng of carriages and of
contemplative pedestrians. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it's safe, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Walker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>subjoined Mrs. Miller. <div class="bookquote">``You'll get the fever, as sure as
you live. Remember what Dr. Davis told you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) some medicine before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>said Randolph.

<p/>The company had risen to its feet; Daisy, still showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) pretty
teeth, bent over and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) hostess. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Walker, you are too
perfect,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going alone; I am going to meet a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your friend won't keep you from getting the fever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Miller
observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it Mr. Giovanelli?''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div>asked the hostess.

<p/>Winterbourne was watching the young girl; at this question his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) attention
quickened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) stood there, smiling and smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) bonnet ribbons;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) glanced at Winterbourne. Then, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) glanced and smiled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
answered, without a shade of hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Giovanelli--the beautiful
Giovanelli.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Walker, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) hand pleadingly,
<div class="bookquote">``don't walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) speaks English,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I don't to do anything improper.
There's an easy way to settle it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) continued to glance at
Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``The Pincio is only a hundred yards distant; and if Mr.
Winterbourne were as polite as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) pretends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) would offer to walk with
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne's politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) gracious leave to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). They passed downstairs
before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, and at the door Winterbourne perceived Mrs. Miller's
carriage drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had
made at Vevey seated within. <div class="bookquote">``Goodbye, Eugenio!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>cried Daisy; <div class="bookquote">``I'm going
to take a walk.''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful
garden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is, in fact, rapidly
traversed. As the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of
vehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young Americans found
their progress much delayed. This fact was highly agreeable to
Winterbourne, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) singular situation.
The slow-moving, idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon
the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) arm; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) wondered what on earth had been in Daisy's mind when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) own
mission, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) sense, apparently, was to consign her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) to the hands
of Mr. Giovanelli; but Winterbourne, at once annoyed and gratified,
resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) would do no such thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why haven't you been to see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>asked Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``You can't get out of
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out
of the train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried
the young girl with her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) little laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you were asleep. You
have had time to go to see Mrs. Walker.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew Mrs. Walker--''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne began to explain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know where you knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>). You knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) at Geneva. She (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) told me so.
Well, you knew me at Vevey. That's just as good. So you ought to have
come.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) no other question than this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) began to prattle
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) own affairs. <div class="bookquote">``We've got splendid rooms at the hotel; Eugenio
says they're the best rooms in Rome. We are going to stay all winter,
if we don't die of the fever; and I guess we'll stay then. It's a great
deal nicer than I thought; I thought it would be fearfully quiet; I was
sure it would be awfully poky. I was sure we should be going round
all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the
pictures and things. But we only had about a week of that, and now
I'm enjoying myself. I know ever so many people, and they are all so
charming. The society's extremely select. There are all kinds--English,
and Germans, and Italians. I think I like the English best. I like their
style of conversation. But there are some lovely Americans. I never saw
anything so hospitable. There's something or other every day. There's
not much dancing; but I must say I never thought dancing was everything.
I was always fond of conversation. I guess I shall have plenty at Mrs.
Walker's, her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) rooms are so small.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>When they had passed the gate of the
Pincian Gardens, Miss Miller began to wonder where Mr. Giovanelli might
be. <div class="bookquote">``We had better go straight to that place in front,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``where
you look at the view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly shall not help you to find him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall find him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) without you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Daisy</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly won't leave me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>cried Winterbourne.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) burst into her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) little laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Are you afraid you'll get lost--or run
over? But there's Giovanelli, leaning against that tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)'s staring at
the women in the carriages: did you ever see anything so cool?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with
folded arms nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) cane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had a handsome face, an artfully poised
hat, a glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) buttonhole. Winterbourne
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) a moment and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to speak to that
man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I mean to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Why, you don't suppose I mean to communicate
by signs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray understand, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``that I intend to remain
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy stopped and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), without a sign of troubled
consciousness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) face, with nothing but the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) charming
eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) happy dimples. <div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a cool one!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>thought the young
man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like the way you say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``It's too imperious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon if I say it wrong. The main point is to give you an
idea of my meaning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The young girl looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more gravely, but with eyes that were
prettier than ever. <div class="bookquote">``I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me,
or to interfere with anything I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you have made a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``You should
sometimes listen to a gentleman--the right one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy began to laugh again. <div class="bookquote">``I do nothing but listen to gentlemen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me if Mr. Giovanelli is the right one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentleman with the nosegay in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bosom had now perceived our two
friends, and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bowed to Winterbourne as well as to the latter's companion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had
a brilliant smile, an intelligent eye; Winterbourne thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) not a
bad-looking fellow. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) nevertheless said to Daisy, <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)'s not the
right one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions; she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
mentioned the name of each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) companions to the other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) strolled
alone with one of them on each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>); Mr. Giovanelli, who spoke
English very cleverly--Winterbourne afterward learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had
practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses--addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
a great deal of very polite nonsense; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was extremely urbane, and the
young American, who said nothing, reflected upon that profundity of
Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in
proportion as they are more acutely disappointed. Giovanelli, of course,
had counted upon something more intimate; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) had not bargained for
a party of three. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) temper in a manner which suggested
far-stretching intentions. Winterbourne flattered himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had
taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) measure. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) is not a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young American;
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) is only a clever imitation of one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) is a music master, or a
penny-a-liner, or a third-rate artist. D__n his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) good looks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giovanelli/Giovanelli</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face; but Winterbourne felt a
superior indignation at his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) own lovely fellow countrywoman's not knowing
the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one. Giovanelli
chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable. It was
true that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant.
<div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``a nice girl ought to
know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) came back to the question whether this was, in fact,
a nice girl. Would a nice girl, even allowing for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being a little
American flirt, make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner?
The rendezvous in this case, indeed, had been in broad daylight and in
the most crowded corner of Rome, but was it not impossible to regard the
choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism? Singular
though it may seem, Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl, in
joining her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) amoroso, should not appear more impatient of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) own
company, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was vexed because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) inclination. It was impossible
to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as a perfectly well-conducted young lady; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was wanting
in a certain indispensable delicacy. It would therefore simplify matters
greatly to be able to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as the object of one of those sentiments
which are called by romancers <div class="bookquote">``lawless passions.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>That she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should seem
to wish to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) would help him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) to think more lightly of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
and to be able to think more lightly of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) much less
perplexing. But Daisy, on this occasion, continued to present herself as
an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had been walking some quarter of an hour, attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) two
cavaliers, and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety, as it
seemed to Winterbourne, to the pretty speeches of Mr. Giovanelli, when
a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up
beside the path. At the same moment Winterbourne perceived that his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
friend Mrs. Walker--the lady whose house he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had lately left--was seated
in the vehicle and was beckoning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>). Leaving Miss Miller's side,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) hastened to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) summons. Mrs. Walker was flushed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) wore an
excited air. <div class="bookquote">``It is really too dreadful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That girl must not
do this sort of thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must not walk here with you two men. Fifty
people have noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``I think it's a pity to make too much
fuss about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity to let the girl ruin herself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is very innocent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s very crazy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Walker. <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see anything so
imbecile as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother? After you had all left me just now, I could not
sit still for thinking of it. It seemed too pitiful, not even to attempt
to save her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here
as quickly as possible. Thank Heaven I have found you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you propose to do with us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>asked Winterbourne, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To ask her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to get in, to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) about here for half an hour, so that
the world may see she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not running absolutely wild, and then to take
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) safely home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it's a very happy thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne; <div class="bookquote">``but you
can try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Walker tried. The young man went in pursuit of Miss Miller, who
had simply nodded and smiled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) interlocutor in the carriage and
had gone her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) companion. Daisy, on learning that Mrs. Walker
wished to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>), retraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) steps with a perfect good grace and
with Mr. Giovanelli at her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) was delighted to
have a chance to present this gentleman to Mrs. Walker. She (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) immediately
achieved the introduction, and declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) life
seen anything so lovely as Mrs. Walker's carriage rug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you admire it,''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>said this lady, smiling sweetly. <div class="bookquote">``Will you
get in and let me put it over you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``I shall admire it much more as I see
you driving round with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do get in and drive with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Walker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be charming, but it's so enchanting just as I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>and Daisy
gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be enchanting, dear child, but it is not the custom here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>urged
Mrs. Walker, leaning forward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) victoria, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) hands devoutly
clasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it ought to be, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``If I didn't walk I should
expire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should walk with your mother, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the lady from Geneva,
losing patience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With my mother dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young girl. Winterbourne saw that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) scented interference. <div class="bookquote">``My mother never walked ten steps in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life.
And then, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) added with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``I am more than five years
old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are old enough to be more reasonable. You are old enough, dear Miss
Miller, to be talked about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy looked at Mrs. Walker, smiling intensely. <div class="bookquote">``Talked about? What do
you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come into my carriage, and I will tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside
her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) to the other. Mr. Giovanelli was bowing to and fro, rubbing down
his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) gloves and laughing very agreeably; Winterbourne thought it a most
unpleasant scene. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I want to know what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said
Daisy presently. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I should like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne wished that Mrs. Walker would tuck in her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) carriage rug and
drive away, but this lady did not enjoy being defied, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) afterward
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>)
demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Daisy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) looked again at Mr. Giovanelli, then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) turned to Winterbourne. There was a little pink flush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) cheek;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was tremendously pretty. <div class="bookquote">``Does Mr. Winterbourne think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) asked
slowly, smiling, throwing back her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) head, and glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) from
head to foot, <div class="bookquote">``that, to save my reputation, I ought to get into the
carriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne colored; for an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) hesitated greatly. It seemed so
strange to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) speak that way of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``reputation.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) himself,
in fact, must speak in accordance with gallantry. The finest gallantry,
here, was simply to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) the truth; and the truth, for Winterbourne,
as the few indications I have been able to give have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) known to
the reader, was that Daisy Miller should take Mrs. Walker's advice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) exquisite prettiness, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said, very gently, <div class="bookquote">``I
think you should get into the carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy gave a violent laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard anything so stiff! If this
is improper, Mrs. Walker,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``then I am all improper, and you
must give me up. Goodbye; I hope you'll have a lovely ride!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and, with
Mr. Giovanelli, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) turned
away.

<p/>Mrs. Walker sat looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>), and there were tears in Mrs. Walker's
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Get in here, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) said to Winterbourne, indicating the place
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>). The young man answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt bound to accompany Miss
Miller, whereupon Mrs. Walker declared that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) refused her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) this
favor she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) would never speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) was evidently in earnest.
Winterbourne overtook Daisy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) companion, and, offering the young
girl his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) hand, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) that Mrs. Walker had made an imperious claim
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) society. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) expected that in answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) would say something
rather free, something to commit herself still further to that
<div class="bookquote">``recklessness''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>from which Mrs. Walker had so charitably endeavored to
dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) only shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) hand, hardly looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), while
Mr. Giovanelli bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the
hat.

<p/>Winterbourne was not in the best possible humor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) seat in
Mrs. Walker's victoria. <div class="bookquote">``That was not clever of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said candidly,
while the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In such a case,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) companion answered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to be clever; I
wish to be EARNEST!''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, your earnestness has only offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has happened very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Walker. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) is so perfectly
determined to compromise herself, the sooner one knows it the better;
one can act accordingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) meant no harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne rejoined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I thought a month ago. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) has been going too far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) been doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything that is not done here. Flirting with any man she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) could pick
up; sitting in corners with mysterious Italians; dancing all the evening
with the same partners; receiving visits at eleven o’clock at night. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>)
mother goes away when visitors come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``sits up till midnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) must be edified by what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sees. I'm told that at their hotel
everyone is talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>), and that a smile goes round among all the
servants when a gentleman comes and asks for Miss Miller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The servants be hanged!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne angrily. <div class="bookquote">``The poor girl's
only fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) presently added, <div class="bookquote">``is that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is very uncultivated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is naturally indelicate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Walker declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take that example this morning. How long had you known her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at Vevey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A couple of days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy, then, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) making it a personal matter that you should have left
the place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne was silent for some moments; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I suspect, Mrs.
Walker, that you and I have lived too long at Geneva!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) added a
request that she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) should inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) with what particular design she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) had
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) enter her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wished to beg you to cease your relations with Miss Miller--not to
flirt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)--to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) no further opportunity to expose herself--to
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) alone, in short.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I can't do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) extremely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the more reason that you shouldn't help her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) to make a scandal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There certainly will be in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) takes them. But I have said what
I had on my conscience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Walker pursued. <div class="bookquote">``If you wish to rejoin the
young lady I will put you down. Here, by the way, you have a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The carriage was traversing that part of the Pincian Garden that
overhangs the wall of Rome and overlooks the beautiful Villa Borghese.
It is bordered by a large parapet, near which there are several seats.
One of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady,
toward whom Mrs. Walker gave a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) head. At the same moment
these persons rose and walked toward the parapet. Winterbourne had asked
the coachman to stop; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) now descended from the carriage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) companion
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) a moment in silence; then, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) hat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>)
drove majestically away. Winterbourne stood there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
eyes toward Daisy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) cavalier. They evidently saw no one; they were
too deeply occupied with each other. When they reached the low garden
wall, they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine
clusters of the Villa Borghese; then Giovanelli seated himself,
familiarly, upon the broad ledge of the wall. The western sun in the
opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars,
whereupon Daisy's companion took her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) parasol out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) hands and opened
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) came a little nearer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) held the parasol over her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>); then,
still holding it, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) let it rest upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) shoulder, so that both of
their heads were hidden from Winterbourne. This young man lingered a
moment, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) began to walk. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) walked--not toward the couple with
the parasol; toward the residence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt, Mrs. Costello.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling
among the servants when he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), at least, asked for Mrs. Miller at her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
hotel. This lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) daughter, however, were not at home; and on
the next day after, repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) visit, Winterbourne again had the
misfortune not to find them. Mrs. Walker's party took place on the
evening of the third day, and, in spite of the frigidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) last
interview with the hostess, Winterbourne was among the guests. Mrs.
Walker was one of those American ladies who, while residing abroad, make
a point, in their own phrase, of studying European society, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>)
had on this occasion collected several specimens of her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) diversely born
fellow mortals to serve, as it were, as textbooks. When Winterbourne
arrived, Daisy Miller was not there, but in a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
mother come in alone, very shyly and ruefully. Mrs. Miller's hair
above her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
approached Mrs. Walker, Winterbourne also drew near.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, I've come all alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said poor Mrs. Miller. <div class="bookquote">``I'm so
frightened; I don't know what to do. It's the first time I've ever been
to a party alone, especially in this country. I wanted to bring Randolph
or Eugenio, or someone, but Daisy just pushed me off by myself. I ain't
used to going round alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) society?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Walker impressively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Daisy's all dressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Miller with that accent of the
dispassionate, if not of the philosophic, historian with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
always recorded the current incidents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) daughter's career. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) got
dressed on purpose before dinner. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)'s got a friend of hers there;
that gentleman--the Italian--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) wanted to bring. They've got going
at the piano; it seems as if they couldn't leave off. Mr. Giovanelli
sings splendidly. But I guess they'll come before very long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>concluded
Mrs. Miller hopefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) should come in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Walker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) that there was no use in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) getting dressed before
dinner if she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was going to wait three hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>responded Daisy's mamma.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't see the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) putting on such a dress as that to sit
round with Mr. Giovanelli.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is most horrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Walker, turning away and addressing
herself to Winterbourne. <div class="bookquote">``Elle s'affiche. It's her (<font color='blue'><b>Elle</b></font>) revenge for my having
ventured to remonstrate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elle</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Elle</b></font>) comes, I shall not speak to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy came after eleven o’clock; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was not, on such an occasion,
a young lady to wait to be spoken to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) rustled forward in radiant
loveliness, smiling and chattering, carrying a large bouquet, and
attended by Mr. Giovanelli. Everyone stopped talking and turned and
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) came straight to Mrs. Walker. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you thought
I never was coming, so I sent mother off to tell you. I wanted to make
Mr. Giovanelli practice some things before he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) came; you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) sings
beautifully, and I want you to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) to sing. This is Mr. Giovanelli;
you know I introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) to you; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)'s got the most lovely voice, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) knows the most charming set of songs. I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) go over them this
evening on purpose; we had the greatest time at the hotel.''  (<font color='red'><b>this Daisy</b></font>)</div>Of all
this Daisy delivered herself with the sweetest, brightest audibleness,
looking now at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) hostess and now round the room, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) gave a
series of little pats, round her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) shoulders, to the edges of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) dress.
<div class="bookquote">``Is there anyone I know?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think every one knows you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Walker</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Walker pregnantly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) gave
a very cursory greeting to Mr. Giovanelli. This gentleman bore himself
gallantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) smiled and bowed and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) white teeth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) curled his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)
mustaches and rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) eyes and performed all the proper functions
of a handsome Italian at an evening party. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) sang very prettily half
a dozen songs, though Mrs. Walker afterward declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) had been
quite unable to find out who asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>). It was apparently not Daisy who
had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) orders. Daisy sat at a distance from the piano, and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had publicly, as it were, professed a high admiration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)
singing, talked, not inaudibly, while it was going on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity these rooms are so small; we can't dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said to
Winterbourne, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) five minutes before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sorry we can't dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne answered; <div class="bookquote">``I don't dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you don't dance; you're too stiff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Miss Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``I hope
you enjoyed your drive with Mrs. Walker!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I didn't enjoy it; I preferred walking with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We paired off: that was much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``But did you ever
hear anything so cool as Mrs. Walker's wanting me to get into her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>)
carriage and drop poor Mr. Giovanelli, and under the pretext that it was
proper? People have different ideas! It would have been most unkind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)
had been talking about that walk for ten days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) should not have talked about it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)
would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about
the streets with him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About the streets?''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>cried Daisy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) pretty stare. <div class="bookquote">``Where, then,
would he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) have proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to walk? The Pincio is not the streets,
either; and I, thank goodness, am not a young lady of this country. The
young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it, so far
as I can learn; I don't see why I should change my habits for THEM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid your habits are those of a flirt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne
gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) cried, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) little smiling stare
again. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a fearful, frightful flirt! Did you ever hear of a nice girl
that was not? But I suppose you will tell me now that I am not a nice
girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a very nice girl; but I wish you would flirt with me, and me
only,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! thank you--thank you very much; you are the last man I should think
of flirting with. As I have had the pleasure of informing you, you are
too stiff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say that too often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/>Daisy gave a delighted laugh. <div class="bookquote">``If I could have the sweet hope of making
you angry, I should say it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do that; when I am angry I'm stiffer than ever. But if you won't
flirt with me, do cease, at least, to flirt with your friend at the
piano; they don't understand that sort of thing here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought they understood nothing else!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in young unmarried women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old
married ones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``when you deal with natives you must go
by the custom of the place. Flirting is a purely American custom;
it doesn't exist here. So when you show yourself in public with Mr.
Giovanelli, and without your mother--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious! poor Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>interposed Daisy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though you may be flirting, Mr. Giovanelli is not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) means something
else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) isn't preaching, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy with vivacity. <div class="bookquote">``And if you
want very much to know, we are neither of us flirting; we are too good
friends for that: we are very intimate friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>rejoined Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``if you are in love with each other, it is
another affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) up to this point to talk so frankly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had no
expectation of shocking her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) by this ejaculation; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) immediately got
up, blushing visibly, and leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) to exclaim mentally that
little American flirts were the queerest creatures in the world. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Giovanelli, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) interlocutor a single
glance, <div class="bookquote">``never says such very disagreeable things to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>interlocutor</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne was bewildered; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) stood, staring. Mr. Giovanelli had
finished singing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) left the piano and came over to Daisy. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you
come into the other room and have some tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) asked, bending before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) ornamental smile.

<p/>Daisy turned to Winterbourne, beginning to smile again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was still
more perplexed, for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear, though
it seemed to prove, indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had a sweetness and softness that
reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses. <div class="bookquote">``It has never occurred
to Mr. Winterbourne to offer me any tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said with her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) little
tormenting manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have offered you advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne rejoined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I prefer weak tea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>cried Daisy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) went off with the brilliant
Giovanelli. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) sat with him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) in the adjoining room, in the embrasure
of the window, for the rest of the evening. There was an interesting
performance at the piano, but neither of these young people gave heed
to it. When Daisy came to take leave of Mrs. Walker, this lady
conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had been guilty at
the moment of the young girl's arrival. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) back straight
upon Miss Miller and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) to depart with what grace she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) might.
Winterbourne was standing near the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) saw it all. Daisy turned
very pale and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mother, but Mrs. Miller was humbly
unconscious of any violation of the usual social forms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) appeared,
indeed, to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) own
striking observance of them. <div class="bookquote">``Good night, Mrs. Walker,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``we've
had a beautiful evening. You see, if I let Daisy come to parties without
me, I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) to go away without me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Daisy turned away, looking
with a pale, grave face at the circle near the door; Winterbourne saw
that, for the first moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was too much shocked and puzzled even
for indignation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) side was greatly touched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was very cruel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said to Mrs. Walker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) never enters my drawing room again!''  (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) hostess.

<p/>Since Winterbourne was not to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) in Mrs. Walker's drawing room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
went as often as possible to Mrs. Miller's hotel. The ladies were rarely
at home, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) found them, the devoted Giovanelli was always
present. Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room
with Daisy alone, Mrs. Miller being apparently constantly of the opinion
that discretion is the better part of surveillance. Winterbourne
noted, at first with surprise, that Daisy on these occasions was never
embarrassed or annoyed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) own entrance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) very presently began
to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had no more surprises for him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>); the unexpected in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
behavior was the only thing to expect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) showed no displeasure at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) tete-a-tete with Giovanelli being interrupted; she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) could chatter as
freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one; there was always,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) conversation, the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility.
Winterbourne remarked to himself that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was seriously interested in
Giovanelli, it was very singular that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) should not take more trouble
to preserve the sanctity of their interviews; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) the more
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) innocent-looking indifference and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) apparently inexhaustible
good humor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) could hardly have said why, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) a girl
who would never be jealous. At the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive
smile on the reader's part, I may affirm that with regard to the women
who had hitherto interested him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), it very often seemed to Winterbourne
among the possibilities that, given certain contingencies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) should be
afraid--literally afraid--of these ladies; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had a pleasant sense that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) should never be afraid of Daisy Miller. It must be added that this
sentiment was not altogether flattering to Daisy; it was part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
conviction, or rather of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) apprehension, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) would prove a very
light young person.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was evidently very much interested in Giovanelli. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) spoke; she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was perpetually telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) to do this and
to do that; she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was constantly <div class="bookquote">``chaffing''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and abusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) appeared
completely to have forgotten that Winterbourne had said anything to
displease her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) at Mrs. Walker's little party. One Sunday afternoon,
having gone to St. Peter's with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) aunt, Winterbourne perceived
Daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable
Giovanelli. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) pointed out the young girl and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cavalier to
Mrs. Costello. This lady looked at them a moment through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyeglass,
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what makes you so pensive in these days, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not the least idea I was pensive,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very much preoccupied; you are thinking of something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``that you accuse me of thinking of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of that young lady's--Miss Baker's, Miss Chandler's--what's her (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>)
name?--Miss Miller's intrigue with that little barber's block.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call it an intrigue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne asked--<div class="bookquote">``an affair that goes
on with such peculiar publicity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's their folly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Costello; <div class="bookquote">``it's not their merit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>rejoined Winterbourne, with something of that pensiveness to which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt had alluded. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that there is anything to be
called an intrigue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) is quite carried
away by him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are certainly very intimate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/>Mrs. Costello inspected the young couple again with her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) optical
instrument. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) is very handsome. One easily sees how it is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) thinks
him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) the most elegant man in the world, the finest gentleman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) has
never seen anything like him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) is better, even, than the courier.
It was the courier probably who introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>); and if he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) succeeds in
marrying the young lady, the courier will come in for a magnificent
commission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thinks of marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``and I
don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) hopes to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be very sure she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thinks of nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) goes on from day to
day, from hour to hour, as they did in the Golden Age. I can imagine
nothing more vulgar. And at the same time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Costello, ``depend
upon it that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may tell you any moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is `engaged.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that is more than Giovanelli expects,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Giovanelli?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The little Italian. I have asked questions about him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) and learned
something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) is apparently a perfectly respectable little man. I
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) is, in a small way, a cavaliere avvocato. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) doesn't
move in what are called the first circles. I think it is really not
absolutely impossible that the courier introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) is evidently
immensely charmed with Miss Miller. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) thinks him (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) the finest
gentleman in the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) side, has never found himself in
personal contact with such splendor, such opulence, such expensiveness
as this young lady's. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) wonderfully pretty
and interesting. I rather doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) dreams of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). That
must appear to him (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) too impossible a piece of luck. He (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) has nothing but
his (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) handsome face to offer, and there is a substantial Mr. Miller in
that mysterious land of dollars. Giovanelli knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) hasn't a title
to offer. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) were only a count or a marchese! He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) must wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)
luck, at the way they have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) accounts for it by his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) handsome face and thinks Miss Miller a young
lady qui se passe ses fantaisies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Costello.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne pursued, <div class="bookquote">``that Daisy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mamma have
not yet risen to that stage of--what shall I call it?--of culture at
which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins. I believe that
they are intellectually incapable of that conception.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but the avvocato can't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Costello.

<p/>Of the observation excited by Daisy's <div class="bookquote">``intrigue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne gathered
that day at St. Peter's sufficient evidence. A dozen of the American
colonists in Rome came to talk with Mrs. Costello, who sat on a little
portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters. The vesper
service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the
adjacent choir, and meanwhile, between Mrs. Costello and her (<font color='blue'><b>Costello</b></font>) friends,
there was a great deal said about poor little Miss Miller's going really
<div class="bookquote">``too far.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne was not pleased with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) heard, but when,
coming out upon the great steps of the church, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) saw Daisy, who had
emerged before him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), get into an open cab with her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) accomplice and roll
away through the cynical streets of Rome, he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) could not deny to himself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was going very far indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) felt very sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)--not
exactly that he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had completely lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) head, but
because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty, and undefended,
and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder.
He (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) made an attempt after this to give a hint to Mrs. Miller. He (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) met one
day in the Corso a friend, a tourist like himself, who had just come
out of the Doria Palace, where he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) had been walking through the beautiful
gallery. His (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait
of Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the
palace, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``And in the same cabinet, by the way, I had the
pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind--that pretty
American girl whom you pointed out to me last week.''  (<font color='red'><b>Velasquez</b></font>)</div>In answer to
Winterbourne's inquiries, his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) friend narrated that the pretty American
girl--prettier than ever--was seated with a companion in the secluded
nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companion?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>asked Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A little Italian with a bouquet in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) buttonhole. The girl is
delightfully pretty, but I thought I understood from you the other day
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a young lady du meilleur monde.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>answered Winterbourne; and having assured himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
informant had seen Daisy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) companion but five minutes before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
jumped into a cab and went to call on Mrs. Miller. She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was at home; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) apologized to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) for receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) in Daisy's absence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s gone out somewhere with Mr. Giovanelli,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Miller. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s
always going round with Mr. Giovanelli.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have noticed that they are very intimate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it seems as if they couldn't live without each other!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Miller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Miller. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)'s a real gentleman, anyhow. I keep telling Daisy she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)'s
engaged!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does Daisy say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) isn't engaged. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) might as well be!''  (<font color='red'><b>this parent</b></font>)</div>this
impartial parent resumed; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) goes on as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was. But I've made Mr.
Giovanelli promise to tell me, if SHE doesn't. I should want to write to
Mr. Miller about it--shouldn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>this parent</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) certainly should; and the state of mind of
Daisy's mamma struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) as so unprecedented in the annals of parental
vigilance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) guard.

<p/>After this Daisy was never at home, and Winterbourne ceased to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
at the houses of their common acquaintances, because, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) perceived,
these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was going too
far. They ceased to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>); and they intimated that they desired to
express to observant Europeans the great truth that, though Miss
Daisy Miller was a young American lady, her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) behavior was not
representative--was regarded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) compatriots as abnormal.
Winterbourne wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) felt about all the cold shoulders that
were turned toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>), and sometimes it annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) to suspect that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) did not feel at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said to himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was too light and
childish, too uncultivated and unreasoning, too provincial, to have
reflected upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) ostracism, or even to have perceived it. Then at
other moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) carried about in her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) elegant and
irresponsible little organism a defiant, passionate, perfectly observant
consciousness of the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) produced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) asked himself whether
Daisy's defiance came from the consciousness of innocence, or from her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
being, essentially, a young person of the reckless class. It must be
admitted that holding one's self to a belief in Daisy's <div class="bookquote">``innocence''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>came
to seem to Winterbourne more and more a matter of fine-spun gallantry.
As I have already had occasion to relate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was angry at finding
himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was vexed at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) want of instinctive certitude as to how far her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eccentricities were
generic, national, and how far they were personal. From either view
of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had somehow missed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and now it was too late. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
<div class="bookquote">``carried away''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>by Mr. Giovanelli.

<p/>A few days after his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) brief interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) encountered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the Palace of
the Caesars. The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and
perfume, and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender
verdure. Daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds
of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental
inscriptions. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) that Rome had never been so lovely as
just then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) stood, looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and
color that remotely encircles the city, inhaling the softly humid odors,
and feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place
reaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) also
that Daisy had never looked so pretty, but this had been an observation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>). Giovanelli was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) side, and Giovanelli,
too, wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy, <div class="bookquote">``I should think you would be lonesome!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lonesome?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>asked Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are always going round by yourself. Can't you get anyone to walk
with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not so fortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``as your companion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Giovanelli, from the first, had treated Winterbourne with distinguished
politeness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) listened with a deferential air to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) remarks; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)
laughed punctiliously at his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) pleasantries; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) seemed disposed to testify
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) belief that Winterbourne was a superior young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) carried
himself in no degree like a jealous wooer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had obviously a great deal
of tact; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>).
It even seemed to Winterbourne at times that Giovanelli would find a
certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>)--to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>), as an intelligent man, that, bless you, HE (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew
how extraordinary was this young lady, and didn't flatter himself with
delusive--or at least TOO delusive--hopes of matrimony and dollars. On
this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strolled away from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion to pluck a sprig of
almond blossom, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carefully arranged in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) buttonhole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know why you say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy, watching Giovanelli. <div class="bookquote">``Because you
think I go round too much with HIM.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) nodded at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) attendant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one thinks so--if you care to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I care to know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>Daisy exclaimed seriously. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't
believe it. They are only pretending to be shocked. They don't really
care a straw what I do. Besides, I don't go round so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you will find they do care. They will show it disagreeably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``How disagreeably?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you noticed anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have noticed you. But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the
first time I saw you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will find I am not so stiff as several others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne,
smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How shall I find it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By going to see the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will they do to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will give you the cold shoulder. Do you know what that means?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) intently; she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) began to color. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean as
Mrs. Walker did the other night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) looked away at Giovanelli, who was decorating himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
almond blossom. Then looking back at Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't think
you would let people be so unkind!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I help it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think you would say something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do say something;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) paused a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I say that your mother
tells me that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) believes you are engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy very simply.

<p/>Winterbourne began to laugh. <div class="bookquote">``And does Randolph believe it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess Randolph doesn't believe anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Daisy. Randolph's
skepticism excited Winterbourne to further hilarity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) observed
that Giovanelli was coming back to them. Daisy, observing it too,
addressed herself again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) countryman. <div class="bookquote">``Since you have mentioned
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I AM engaged.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>* * * Winterbourne looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had
stopped laughing. <div class="bookquote">``You don't believe!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) added.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) was silent a moment; and then, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, you don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Well, then--I am not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl cicerone</b></font>)</div><p/>The young girl and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) cicerone were on their way to the gate of the
enclosure, so that Winterbourne, who had but lately entered, presently
took leave of them. A week afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) went to dine at a beautiful
villa on the Caelian Hill, and, on arriving, dismissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) hired
vehicle. The evening was charming, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) promised himself the
satisfaction of walking home beneath the Arch of Constantine and past
the vaguely lighted monuments of the Forum. There was a waning moon in
the sky, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) radiance was not brilliant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was veiled in a
thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it. When, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Constantine</b></font>)
return from the villa -LRB-it was eleven o’clock-RRB-, Winterbourne approached
the dusky circle of the Colosseum, it recurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), as a lover of
the picturesque, that the interior, in the pale moonshine, would be well
worth a glance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches,
near which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) observed, an open carriage--one of the little Roman
streetcabs--was stationed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) passed in, among the cavernous
shadows of the great structure, and emerged upon the clear and silent
arena. The place had never seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) more impressive. One-half of
the gigantic circus was in deep shade, the other was sleeping in the
luminous dusk. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) stood there he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) began to murmur Byron's famous
lines, out of <div class="bookquote">``Manfred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Byron</b></font>)</div>but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) quotation
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the Colosseum are
recommended by the poets, they are deprecated by the doctors. The
historic atmosphere was there, certainly; but the historic atmosphere,
scientifically considered, was no better than a villainous miasma.
Winterbourne walked to the middle of the arena, to take a more general
glance, intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat. The great cross in
the center was covered with shadow; it was only as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) drew near it that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) made it out distinctly. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) saw that two persons were stationed
upon the low steps which formed its base. One of these was a woman,
seated; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companion was standing in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>Presently the sound of the woman's voice came to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) distinctly in the
warm night air. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Manfred</b></font>) looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers
may have looked at the Christian martyrs!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>These were the words he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
heard, in the familiar accent of Miss Daisy Miller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is not very hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giovanelli/Giovanelli</b></font>)</div>responded the ingenious Giovanelli.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) will have to take me first; you will serve for dessert!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with
a sort of relief. It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed
upon the ambiguity of Daisy's behavior, and the riddle had become easy
to read. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be
at pains to respect. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood there, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)--looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
companion and not reflecting that though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saw them vaguely, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) himself
must have been more brightly visible. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) felt angry with himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
had bothered so much about the right way of regarding Miss Daisy Miller.
Then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was going to advance again, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) checked himself, not from the
fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) injustice, but from a sense of the danger
of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from
cautious criticism. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned away toward the entrance of the place,
but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heard Daisy speak again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it was Mr. Winterbourne! He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) saw me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) cuts me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a reprobate</b></font>)</div><p/>What a clever little reprobate she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was, and how smartly she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) played at
injured innocence! But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wouldn't cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>). Winterbourne came forward
again and went toward the great cross. Daisy had got up; Giovanelli
lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) hat. Winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the
craziness, from a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl
lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria. What if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) WERE
a clever little reprobate? that was no reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dying of the
perniciosa. <div class="bookquote">``How long have you been here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) asked almost brutally.

<p/>Daisy, lovely in the flattering moonlight, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) a moment.
Then--<div class="bookquote">``All the evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) answered, gently. * * * <div class="bookquote">``I never saw
anything so pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``that you will not think Roman fever
very pretty. This is the way people catch it. I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) added,
turning to Giovanelli, <div class="bookquote">``that you, a native Roman, should countenance
such a terrible indiscretion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giovanelli/Giovanelli</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the handsome native, <div class="bookquote">``for myself I am not afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither am I--for you! I am speaking for this young lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giovanelli/Giovanelli</b></font>)</div><p/>Giovanelli lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) well-shaped eyebrows and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) brilliant
teeth. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) took Winterbourne's rebuke with docility. <div class="bookquote">``I told the
signorina it was a grave indiscretion, but when was the signorina ever
prudent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was sick, and I don't mean to be!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the signorina declared. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't look like much, but I'm healthy! I was bound to see the Colosseum
by moonlight; I shouldn't have wanted to go home without that; and we
have had the most beautiful time, haven't we, Mr. Giovanelli? If there
has been any danger, Eugenio can give me some pills. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenio</b></font>) has got some
splendid pills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should advise you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne, <div class="bookquote">``to drive home as fast as
possible and take one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What you say is very wise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giovanelli/Giovanelli</b></font>)</div>Giovanelli rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``I will go and make
sure the carriage is at hand.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) went forward rapidly.

<p/>Daisy followed with Winterbourne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) kept looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) seemed
not in the least embarrassed. Winterbourne said nothing; Daisy chattered
about the beauty of the place. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I HAVE seen the Colosseum by
moonlight!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``That's one good thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Then, noticing
Winterbourne's silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) didn't speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) made
no answer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) only began to laugh. They passed under one of the dark
archways; Giovanelli was in front with the carriage. Here Daisy stopped
a moment, looking at the young American. <div class="bookquote">``DID you believe I was engaged,
the other day?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter what I believed the other day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne,
still laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you believe now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged
or not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) felt the young girl's pretty eyes fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) through the thick
gloom of the archway; she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was apparently going to answer. But Giovanelli
hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) forward. <div class="bookquote">``Quick! quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``if we get in by midnight
we are quite safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Daisy took her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) seat in the carriage, and the fortunate Italian placed
himself beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't forget Eugenio's pills!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>said Winterbourne as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>said Daisy in a little strange tone, <div class="bookquote">``whether I have
Roman fever or not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller/Daisy/Miller</b></font>)</div>Upon this the cab driver cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whip, and they
rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.

<p/>Winterbourne, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) justice, as it were, mentioned to no one that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had encountered Miss Miller, at midnight, in the Colosseum with a
gentleman; but nevertheless, a couple of days later, the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
having been there under these circumstances was known to every member
of the little American circle, and commented accordingly. Winterbourne
reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel, and that, after
Daisy's return, there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter
and the cab driver. But the young man was conscious, at the same moment,
that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the
little American flirt should be <div class="bookquote">``talked about''  (<font color='red'><b>the flirt</b></font>)</div>by low-minded menials.
These people, a day or two later, had serious information to give: the
little American flirt was alarmingly ill. Winterbourne, when the rumor
came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), immediately went to the hotel for more news. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) found that
two or three charitable friends had preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>), and that they were
being entertained in Mrs. Miller's salon by Randolph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's going round at night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>said Randolph--<div class="bookquote">``that's what made her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) sick.
She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'s always going round at night. I shouldn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'d want to,
it's so plaguy dark. You can't see anything here at night, except when
there's a moon. In America there's always a moon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Randolph</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Miller was
invisible; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was now, at least, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) daughter the advantage of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) society. It was evident that Daisy was dangerously ill.

<p/>Winterbourne went often to ask for news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>), and once he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) saw Mrs.
Miller, who, though deeply alarmed, was, rather to his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) surprise,
perfectly composed, and, as it appeared, a most efficient and judicious
nurse. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) talked a good deal about Dr. Davis, but Winterbourne paid her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
the compliment of saying to himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was not, after all, such
a monstrous goose. <div class="bookquote">``Daisy spoke of you the other day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Half the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) doesn't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)'s saying, but that time I think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) gave me a message she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) told me to tell you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) told me to
tell you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) never was engaged to that handsome Italian. I am sure
I am very glad; Mr. Giovanelli hasn't been near us since she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was taken
ill. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) was so much of a gentleman; but I don't call that
very polite! A lady told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) was afraid I was angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) for
taking Daisy round at night. Well, so I am, but I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) knows I'm a
lady. I would scorn to scold him (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>). Anyway, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s not engaged. I
don't know why she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wanted you to know, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said to me three times,
`Mind you tell Mr. Winterbourne.' And then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me to ask if you
remembered the time you went to that castle in Switzerland. But I said
I wouldn't give any such messages as that. Only, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not engaged,
I'm sure I'm glad to know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>But, as Winterbourne had said, it mattered very little. A week after
this, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever.
Daisy's grave was in the little Protestant cemetery, in an angle of
the wall of imperial Rome, beneath the cypresses and the thick spring
flowers. Winterbourne stood there beside it, with a number of other
mourners, a number larger than the scandal excited by the young lady's
career would have led you to expect. Near him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) stood Giovanelli, who came
nearer still before Winterbourne turned away. Giovanelli was very pale:
on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) had no flower in his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) buttonhole; he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) seemed to wish
to say something. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the most beautiful young
lady I ever saw, and the most amiable;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) added in a moment,
<div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the most innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) and presently repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``And the
most innocent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The most innocent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne felt sore and angry. <div class="bookquote">``Why the devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``did you
take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to that fatal place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giovanelli's urbanity was apparently imperturbable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) looked on the
ground a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``For myself I had no fear; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
wanted to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was no reason!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div>Winterbourne declared.

<p/>The subtle Roman again dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had lived, I should
have got nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would never have married me, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would never have married you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a moment I hoped so. But no. I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Winterbourne/Mr. Winterbourne</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) stood staring at the raw protuberance
among the April daisies. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) turned away again, Mr. Giovanelli, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Giovanelli</b></font>) light, slow step, had retired.

<p/>Winterbourne almost immediately left Rome; but the following summer he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>)
again met his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt, Mrs. Costello at Vevey. Mrs. Costello was fond of
Vevey. In the interval Winterbourne had often thought of Daisy Miller
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mystifying manners. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) aunt--said it
was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) conscience that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) injustice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Costello. <div class="bookquote">``How did your injustice
affect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sent me a message before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) death which I didn't understand at the
time; but I have understood it since. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have appreciated one's
esteem.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that a modest way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Costello, <div class="bookquote">``of saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would
have reciprocated one's affection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Costello</b></font>)</div><p/>Winterbourne offered no answer to this question; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) presently said,
<div class="bookquote">``You were right in that remark that you made last summer. I was booked
to make a mistake. I have lived too long in foreign parts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) went back to live at Geneva, whence there continue to
come the most contradictory accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) motives of sojourn: a report
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``studying''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>hard--an intimation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Winterbourne</b></font>) is much interested in
a very clever foreign lady.
